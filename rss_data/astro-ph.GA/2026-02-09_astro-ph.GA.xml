      <title>The Host Galaxies of Active Galactic Nuclei with Direct Black Hole Mass Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping (RM) determines the mass of black holes (BH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by resolving the BH gravitational sphere of influence in the time domain. Recent RM campaigns yielded direct BH masses through dynamical modeling for a sample of 32 objects, spanning a wide range of AGN luminosities and BH masses. In addition, accurate BH masses have been determined by spatially resolving the broad-line region with GRAVITY for a handful of AGNs. Here, we present a detailed analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images using surface-brightness profile fitting with state-of-the-art programs. We derive AGN luminosity and host-galaxy properties, such as radii and luminosities for spheroid, disk, and bar (if present). The spheroid effective radii were used to measure stellar velocity dispersion from integral-field spectroscopy. Since the BH masses of our sample do not depend on any assumption of the virial factor needed in single-epoch spectroscopic mass estimates, we can show that the resulting scaling relations between the mass of the supermassive BHs and their host galaxies match those of quiescent galaxies, naturally extending to lower masses in these (predominantly) spiral galaxies. We find that the inner AGN orientation, as traced by the broad-line region inclination angle, is uncorrelated with the host-galaxy disk. Our sample has the most direct and accurate MBH measurements of any AGN sample and provides a fundamental local benchmark for studies of the evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Modelling the photometric and morphological evolution of disc galaxies in the cluster environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations indicate that the disc population in galaxy clusters has undergone rapid evolution, transitioning from a dominance of blue spirals to red S0s over the past $\sim7$ Gyr. We build a simplified cluster evolutionary model in the $\Lambda$CDM framework to constrain the characteristic timescales of this transformation. In our model, field spirals joining the cluster are subject to ram-pressure stripping (RPS), which removes their gas reservoir leading to the quenching of their star formation on a timescale $t_{\rm s}$, and to an (initially) unspecified mechanism that transforms them into S0s on a timescale $t_{\rm m}$. We assume that $t_{\rm s}$ and $t_{\rm m}$ are independent and both power-law functions of $M_\star/M_{\rm cl}$, the galaxy-to-cluster mass ratio. We constrain our model using the observed distribution of spirals and S0s in a color-mass plane from the OmegaWINGS and EDisCS cluster surveys at $z\simeq0.055$ and $z\simeq0.7$. Our best-fit model reproduces the data remarkably well and predicts evolutionary trends for the main morphological fractions in agreement with previous studies. We find typical $t_{\rm s}$ between $0.1$ and $1$ Gyr, compatible with previous estimates. A surprisingly strong anti-correlation between $t_{\rm s}$ and $M_\star/M_{\rm cl}$ is required in order to suppress the formation of red, low-mass spirals at low redshift, which we interpret as driven by orbit anisotropy. Conversely, $t_{\rm m}$ depends very weakly on $M_\star/M_{\rm cl}$ and has typical values of a few Gyr. The inferred morphological evolution is compatible with that resulting from the ageing of the stellar populations in galaxies abruptly quenched by ram pressure stripping: we confirm spectrophotometric ageing as a key channel for the spiral-to-S0 transition in galaxy clusters, with secular evolution playing a secondary role.</description>

      <title>The imprint of AGN-driven outflows on the CGM: the case of Ly{\alpha} nebulae around high-z quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in powering the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae observed around high-redshift quasars. In such simulations, AGN feedback seeded as powerful outflows leads to extended and luminous nebulae whose morphology and surface-brightness profiles accurately reproduce the observations, while suppressing AGN feedback leads to compact and faint nebulae. This link might arise from outflows opening up a channel for Ly$\alpha$ photons to escape from the galactic nucleus to the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The main aim of this paper is to test this theoretical prediction using observations, by comparing the physical properties of outflows and Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. We analyze integral-field unit data obtained with VLT/ERIS and GEMINI/GNIRS to trace the ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a sample of six quasars at $z\sim2-3$, using the [O III] emission line. We detect powerful outflows in all the quasars of our sample, with velocities $&gt;1500~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and kinetic energies $ \gtrsim 2\times10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. Four of our quasars are spatially resolved and show signs of extended [O III] emission out to distances $&gt;2$ kpc from the central supermassive black hole. When excluding one outlier, we find a positive monotonic correlation between the outflow power and the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae size ($\rho=0.89$, $p=0.03$) and luminosity ($\rho=0.6$, $p=0.28$). Additionally, we find evidence of spatial alignment between the ionization cone and the inner and brightest regions of the Ly$\alpha$ nebula. Our results provide tentative evidence in support of the theoretical prediction that AGN-driven outflows at ISM scales open a low-optical-depth path for central Ly$\alpha$ photons to reach the CGM and create extended nebulae.</description>

      <title>On the radial velocity wave in the Galactic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars in the Galactic disk have mean radial velocities $\overline{v}_R$ that oscillate as a function of angular momentum $J_\varphi$. This `$J_\varphi$-${\overline{v}}_R$ wave' signal also exhibits a systematic phase shift when stars are binned by their dynamical temperatures. However, the origin of the wave is unknown. Here we use linear perturbation theory to derive a simple analytic formula for the $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ signal that depends on the equilibrium properties of the Galaxy and the history of recent perturbations to it. The formula naturally explains the phase shift, but also predicts that different classes of perturbation should drive $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ signals with very different morphologies. Ignoring the self-gravity of disk fluctuations, it suggests that neither a distant tidal kick (e.g., from the Sgr dwarf) nor a rigidly-rotating Galactic bar can produce a qualitatively correct $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ wave signal. However, short-lived spiral arms can, and by performing an MCMC fit we identify a spiral perturbation that drives a $J_\varphi$-${\overline{v}}_R$ signal in reasonable agreement with the data. We verify the analytic formula with test particle simulations, finding it to be highly accurate when applied to dynamically cold stellar populations. More work is needed to deal with hotter orbits, and to incorporate the fluctuations' self-gravity and the role of interstellar gas.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxy Number Counts within 25 Mpc: Predictions from Local Group Analogues in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern generation of wide-field galaxy surveys, such as LSST, Euclid and Roman, will enable studies of dwarf galaxies $(10^6 \leq M_\ast / M_\odot \leq 10^9)$ beyond the Local Group (LG) in unprecedented detail. Improved theoretical understanding of this population is necessary to guide these observations, since predictions in this regime are generally limited to specific environments like the LG. We present predictions for the population of dwarf galaxies from the TNG50 run of the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, focusing on the environments within $1 &lt; D / \mathrm{Mpc} &lt; 25$ of LG analogues at $z = 0$. In the simulated sample, there are $\sim 1,000$ and $\sim 12,000$ dwarf galaxies within $10$ and $25$ Mpc, respectively. We compare our results with the 50 Mpc Galaxy Catalog and estimate that current observations are highly incomplete at low masses: for $10^6 \leq M_\ast / M_\odot \leq 10^7$ $(-13 \lesssim M_r \lesssim -10)$, we find completeness fractions of $\sim 23 \%$ within $10$ Mpc and $\sim 4 \%$ within $25$ Mpc. The simulated galaxies below the completeness limits of the observations exist in a range of environments, with notable populations of field dwarfs at all distances and satellites around centrals with masses $10^8 \lesssim M_\ast / M_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$ within $10-25$ Mpc. We find that there are $\sim 8$ times more quiescent dwarf galaxies in the TNG50 sample than are currently cataloged. Our results suggest that upcoming observations should uncover a substantial population of dwarf galaxies, and that $\gtrsim 15 \%$ of these will be red, currently quenched galaxies in the field.</description>

      <title>Treecode2: The Power of Pluralism. I. Static Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe an `oct-tree' N-body code which randomly shifts, reorients, and resizes the root cell at each time step. Averaging over a plurality of root cell positions and orientations statistically restores translational and rotational invariance. The potentials and forces which result can be much more accurate than those obtained from a single force calculation. In this paper, the principle of averaging is tested on static configurations. The next paper will show how this technique can substantially improve global energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservation at a negligible computational cost.</description>

      <title>ELUCID-DESI I: A Parallel MPI Implementation of the Initial Condition Solver for Large-Scale Reconstruction Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a highly scalable, MPI-parallelized framework for reconstructing the initial cosmic density field, designed to meet the computational demands of next-generation cosmological simulations, particularly the upcoming ELUCID-DESI simulation based on DESI BGS data. Building upon the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach and the FastPM solver, our code employs domain decomposition to efficiently distribute memory between nodes. Although communication overhead increases the per-step runtime of the MPI version by roughly a factor of eight relative to the shared-memory implementation, our scaling tests-spanning different particle numbers, core counts, and node layouts-show nearly linear scaling with respect to both the number of particles and the number of CPU cores. Furthermore, to significantly reduce computational costs during the initial burn-in phase, we introduce a novel ``guess'' module that rapidly generates a high-quality initial density field. The results of the simulation test confirm substantial efficiency gains: for $256^3$ particles, 53 steps ($\sim$54 CPU hours) are saved; for $1024^3$, 106 steps ($\sim$7500 CPU hours). The relative gain grows with the number of particles, rendering large-volume reconstructions computationally practical for upcoming surveys, including our planned ELUCID-DESI reconstruction simulation with $8192^3$ particles, with a rough estimation of 720 steps ($\sim$37,000,000 CPU hours).</description>

      <title>Galaxies caught in transition: the role of group environment in shaping the mass-size relation in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar mass-size relation is a sensitive probe of how environment shapes galaxy structure. We analyse this relation in the local Universe for galaxies in compact groups (CGs), low-mass groups ($M_{\rm vir} \leq 10^{13}~M_{\odot}$), and high-mass groups, comparing them to field galaxies using data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey. Galaxies are classified as early types (ETGs; $n \geq 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 \geq 2.3$), late types (LTGs; $n &lt; 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 &lt; 2.3$), transition galaxies (TGs; $n &lt; 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 \geq 2.3$), and others (OGs; $n \geq 2.5$, $(u-r)_0 &lt; 2.3$). We find that ETGs and OGs show no significant environmental dependence: their mass-size slopes and intercepts are statistically consistent across CGs, groups, and the field. LTGs also follow similar relations in the field and in most groups, with only a modest tendency for LTGs in CGs to be smaller at fixed stellar mass. By contrast, TGs display a clear environmental signal: in groups the slope steepens to $\alpha \sim 0.4$ (versus $\alpha \sim 0.2$ in the field) and their sizes are smaller than in the field, with non-overlapping 95\% posterior intervals. These trends suggest that TGs in denser environments are more structurally evolved, likely owing to enhanced bulge prominence and fading of the outer disc, consistent with the S\'ersic-index distributions, which show an excess of TGs with $n_r \gtrsim 1.5$ in groups and CGs. Our findings highlight TGs as an environmentally sensitive population, providing insight into the structural transformation of galaxies in group environments.</description>

      <title>Heavy interstellar scattering toward the near end of the Galactic bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a pilot observational wide-field VLBI campaign on probing scattering properties of the partly ionized interstellar medium towards the Galactic plane sky region between $28^\circ&lt;l&lt;36^\circ$ and $|b|&lt;1^\circ$. This covers the region where the Galactic bar connects to the spiral arms and where a lot of star formation is currently ongoing. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the whole region were performed in a special mode with multiple phase centers at L-band (1.4 -- 1.8 GHz) during April-June 2022 and a year later complemented by sessions at S (2.2 -- 2.4 GHz) and C-band (4.6 -- 5.0 GHz) partially covering the pilot region. We found compelling evidence that target sources are subject to scattering. The total detection rate in L, S and C-bands is 1.5, 3.4 and 9.2 per cent, respectively, and approximately scales with the square of the observation frequency. The low rate values imply that scattering is strong. Its power is non-uniform across the Galactic plane and it can be approximated by a Gaussian with a width of about $2^\circ$ peaking at the Galactic mid-plane. One of the brightest sources of the field shows anisotropic scattering, with a $\lambda^2$ dependence of its observed angular size, along a position angle of $26^\circ$ aligned with the line of constant Galactic latitude. We estimate the turbulence dissipation scale $r_\text{in}\approx1500$ km toward the source J1833+0015.</description>

      <title>The X-ray properties of the most luminous quasars with strong emission-line outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong outflows from active galactic nuclei are frequently observed in objects with lower coronal X-ray luminosity. This intrinsic X-ray weakness is considered a requirement for the formation of radiatively driven winds. To obtain an unbiased view on the connection between X-ray emission and the presence of powerful winds in the most luminous quasar phase, we present an X-ray analysis of a sample of extremely luminous, radio-quiet quasars with signatures of strong outflows in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) emission spectra. We study the $Chandra$ X-ray spectral properties of 10 objects, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasar catalogue based on their UV luminosities and ${\rm C}_{\rm IV}$ emission line blueshifts, comparing them to typical optically blue quasars. Our analysis reveals that seven out of 10 quasars in our sample have photon indices $\Gamma&gt;1.7$. Only two out of 10 objects exhibiting outflows with velocities exceeding 1400 km/s are X-ray 'weak', consistent with the fraction of X-ray 'weak' objects generally observed in quasar populations. Notably, one of the objects identified as X-ray 'weak' is likely an intrinsically X-ray 'normal' quasar that is heavily obscured. We observe a tentative indication at a $\sim$2$\sigma$ confidence level that the correlation between the excessively low X-ray flux level and the presence of ${\rm C}_{\rm IV}$ emission-line outflows might emerge at wind velocities greater than 3000 km/s. Our study provides additional evidence that the relationship between X-ray emission and the presence of winds is intricate. Our findings emphasise the need for X-ray observations of a larger sample of UV-selected quasars with confirmed strong emission-line outflows to unravel the nuanced interplay between winds and X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the missing mass problem in MOND for nearby galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z &lt; 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND.</description>

Abstract: We present a unified Bayesian assessment of model comparison and data-set consistency for LCDM (cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant) and minimal extensions (neutrino mass, spatial curvature, constant or evolving dark energy) using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and type Ia supernova (SN) data. The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\ell$ versus high-$\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\,\sigma$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $\tau$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature.</description>

      <title>Ne and Fe abundances in the ISM: Archival Study of Fe-L and Ne-K edges in Chandra and XMM-Newton</title>

Abstract: The abundance of elements in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a key facet for many fields of astrophysical study. In the soft X-ray spectra, absorption by interstellar gas can result in deep absorption features that affect continuum measurements. In this paper, we focus on measuring the abundance of interstellar iron and neon from the column densities observed in soft spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra for various low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which allows for a direct probe of elemental abundances. As a noble gas, neon will not deplete into solid form, thus providing a benchmark with abundances determined via UV spectroscopy. We find that, when assuming Fe is 90\% depleted into grains, [Fe/Ne]$ = -0.523\pm0.025$, [Fe/H]$ + 12 = 7.482\pm0.016$, and [Ne/H]$ + 12 = 8.012\pm0.022$, which are the tightest observational constraints on these abundances to date, while being consistent with literature which uses protosolar abundances. We also test how depletion into solid grains and scattering affect the results. The choice of depletion fraction can affect the abundance measurement by roughly $5\%$, and that the inclusion of a scattering component can affect abundance measurements by $\sim1-7\%$.</description>

      <title>Hypersoft X-ray Sources: A New Class of Luminous Cosmic Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray binaries, powered by black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs accreting matter from a companion star, are among the brightest beacons in galaxies, outshining the Sun by a factor of millions. Most emit primarily above 0.3 keV in X-rays, but cooler thermal sources peaking in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) would be much more difficult to detect due to astronomy's critical blind spot in EUV. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios &gt;8, the most luminous examples radiate &gt;1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV. They rank among the most energetic sources in galaxies, yet their EUV-peaking spectra evaded earlier detections. We propose that hypersoft sources are X-ray binaries spanning multiple physical classes, including accreting white dwarfs or post-nova systems-potential Type Ia supernova progenitors-and systems hosting accreting black holes. Beyond their elusive nature, they may play crucial role in ionizing gas within galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Splashback Radii to z=1.65 from Galaxy Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2) is a WISE-selected catalog of galaxy clusters at $0.1&lt;z&lt;2$ covering an effective area of $&gt;6000$ deg$^2$. In this paper, we derive splashback radii for this cluster ensemble from galaxy density profiles and constrain the mass threshold of the survey as a function of redshift. We use MaDCoWS2 cluster candidates at $0.4\leq z \leq 1.65$ divided into subsamples with different signal-to-noise (S/N$_{\rm P}$) and redshifts, cross-correlated with galaxies from the CatWISE2020 catalog, to obtain average surface density profiles. We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive parameter estimates for theoretical models consisting of orbiting and infalling terms. A distinct splashback feature is detected in all subsamples. The measured splashback radii span from $0.89^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc/cMpc ($0.61^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ proper Mpc/pMpc) at $\overline{z}=0.45$ to $1.27^{+0.05}_{-0.05}h^{-1}$ cMpc ($0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.04}h^{-1}$ pMpc) at $\overline{z}=1.54$. We also find that splashback radii increase with $S/N_{\rm P}$ at fixed redshift. The resultant splashback radii constrain the redshift dependence of the mass of MaDCoWS2 clusters at fixed $S/N_{\rm P}$. We calculate $M_{\rm 200m}$ from the radii using a relation based on a cosmological simulation. MaDCoWS2 $M_{\rm 200m}$ values derived from the simulation-based relation are lower than the expected values based on weak-lensing observations. More robust mass constraints will come from calibrating splashback radii derived from galaxy density profiles with weak lensing shear profiles from facilities such as $\textit{Euclid}$, Rubin, and $\textit{Roman}$.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Detection of splashback radii in galaxy cluster total light stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The splashback radius, the radius of the apocenter of the first orbit of infalling material, is a measurable quantity marking the boundary between a galaxy cluster and its infalling region. We report detections of splashback radii in total light stacks, i.e. image stacks centered on the cores of galaxy clusters. Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\slash N$) ratios. We adopt a statistical approach, using 1000 bootstrap realizations to determine the median projected splashback radius and its confidence interval in a given bin. We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K. Thongkham et al. on a similar sample of MaDCoWS2 clusters using galaxy-cluster cross-correlation and find that they are consistent, although our method yields larger error bars. Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts. We present a potential application of this new technique to probe the evolution of the stellar mass in cluster infalling regions.</description>

      <title>Merger Driven or Internal Evolution? A New Morphological Study of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Host galaxies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show enhanced central stellar concentration and are preferentially found in post-starburst and green valley populations. This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic ages for 17,000 stars in Kepler, K2 and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of asteroseismic constraints for tens of thousands of red giant (RG) stars has opened the door to robust age estimates, enabling time-resolved studies of different populations of stars in the Milky Way. This study leverages data from Kepler, K2, and TESS, in conjunction with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and spectroscopic constraints from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, to infer parameters for over 17,000 RGs. We use the code PARAM to homogeneously infer stellar properties considering in detail the sensitivity of our results to different choices of observational constraints. We focus on age estimation, identifying potentially unreliable age determinations, and highlight stars with unreliable $\Delta\nu$ measurements based on comparisons using Gaia luminosities. These are particularly relevant in K2 data due to the short duration of the observations of each campaign, and therefore important to characterise for Galactic archaeology studies where the spatial range of K2 is a benefit. Thanks to the combination of data from different missions we explore trends in age, mass, and orbital parameters such as $R_\mathrm{g}$ and $Z_\mathrm{max}$, and examine time-resolved [$\alpha$/M]-[Fe/H] planes across different Galactic regions. Additionally, we compare age distributions in low- and high-$\alpha$ populations and chemically selected ex situ stars. The study also extends known mass-[C/N] ratio relationships to lower masses. The catalogues resulting from this work will be instrumental in addressing key questions in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution, and to improve training sets for machine-learning-based age estimations.</description>

      <title>Optical spectral characterization of OP 313. Constraining the contribution of thermal and non-thermal optical emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasar OP 313 was discovered in December 2023 in very-high-energy $\gamma$ rays above 100 GeV, enabling for the first time a complete characterization of its emission. However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $\gamma$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\mathrm{Mg \ II}} = (0.85 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum. From the stable Mg II line we derive a constant luminosity of the thermal components, $\log(L_{\mathrm{BLR}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.91 \pm 0.19$, $\log(L_{\mathrm{disk}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 45.91 \pm 0.19$ and $\log(L_{\mathrm{torus}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.70 \pm 0.16$, and estimated a BH mass of $\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=8.36 \pm 0.18$, in line with with that derived from the C III] line. These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $\lambda =L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature.</description>

      <title>Spectral Appearance of Self-gravitating AGN Disks Powered by Stellar Objects: Universal Effective Temperature in the Optical Continuum and Application to Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\bullet$, and disk viscosity $\alpha$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\dot{M}/\alpha \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot /{\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.</description>

      <title>The density-bounded twilight of starbursts in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The peculiar nebular emission displayed by galaxies in the early Universe presents a unique opportunity to gain insight into the regulation of star formation in extreme environments. We investigate 500 (109) galaxies with deep NIRSpec/PRISM observations from the JADES survey at $z&gt;2$ ($z&gt;5.3$), finding 52 (26) galaxies with Balmer line ratios more than $1\sigma$ inconsistent with Case B recombination. These anomalous Balmer emitters (ABEs) cannot be explained by dust attenuation, indicating a departure from Case B recombination. To address this discrepancy, we model density-bounded nebulae with the photoionisation code CLOUDY. Density-bounded nebulae show anomalous Balmer line ratios due to Lyman line pumping and a transition from the nebulae being optically thin to optically thick for Lyman lines with increasing cloud depth. The H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ versus H$\gamma$/H$\beta$ trend of density-bounded models is robust to changes in stellar age of the ionising source, gas density, and ionisation parameter; however, increasing the stellar metallicity drives a turnover in the trend. This is due to stronger stellar absorption features around Ly$\gamma$ reducing H$\beta$ fluorescence, allowing density-bounded models to account for all observed Balmer line ratios. ABEs show higher [OIII]/[OII], have steeper ultra-violet slopes, are fainter, and are more preferentially Ly$\alpha$ emitters than galaxies which are consistent with Case B and little dust. These findings suggest that ABEs are galaxies that have become density bounded during extreme quenching events, representing a transient phase of $\sim$20 Myr during a fast breathing mode of star formation.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Burst, quench, repeat -- unveiling the evolution of high-redshift galaxies along the star-forming main sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the evolution of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) at high redshift is crucial to contextualize the observed extreme properties of galaxies in the early Universe. We present an analysis of the SFMS and its scatter in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations, where we find a redshift evolution of the SFMS normalization scaling as $\propto (1+z)^{2.64\pm0.03}$, significantly stronger than is typically inferred from observations. We can reproduce the flatter observed evolution by filtering out weakly star-forming galaxies, implying that current observational fits are biased due to a missing population of lulling galaxies or overestimated star-formation rates. We also explore star-formation variability using the scatter of galaxies around the SFMS ($\sigma_{\mathrm{MS}}$). At the population level, the scatter around the SFMS increases with cosmic time, driven by the increased importance of long-term environmental effects in regulating star formation at later times. To study short-term star-formation variability, or ''burstiness'', we isolate the scatter on timescales shorter than 50 Myr. The short-term scatter is larger at higher redshift, indicating that star formation is indeed more bursty in the early Universe. We identify two starburst modes: (i) externally driven, where rapid large-scale inflows trigger and fuel prolonged, extreme star formation episodes, and (ii) internally driven, where cyclical ejection and re-accretion of the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies drive bursts, even under relatively steady large-scale inflow. Both modes occur at all redshifts, but the increased burstiness of galaxies at higher redshift is due to the increasing prevalence of the more extreme external mode of star formation.</description>

Abstract: We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift ($3 &lt; z &lt; 13$) using the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on the mass range of $10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; \mathrm{M}_{\ast} &lt; 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is tightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main sequence tend to form stars in a central starburst, which decreases their radial size. These galaxies quench inside-out, causing spatially extended star formation and increasing their radial size, leading to oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably, we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power law as a function of redshift, with a break at $z\approx6$, because the majority of galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ show rising star-formation histories, and therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H$\alpha$ emission is systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7, consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous interpretations that link extended H$\alpha$ sizes to inside-out growth, we find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from H$\alpha$. Instead, a simple Str\"{o}mgren sphere argument reproduces observed trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the primary driver of extended nebular emission.</description>

      <title>The Shape of FIREbox Galaxies and a Potential Tension with Low-mass Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the intrinsic and observable shapes of approximately 700 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses of $10^8 - 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ from the FIREbox simulation at $z=0$. We calculate intrinsic axis ratios using inertia tensors weighted by three morphology types: "All Stars," "Young Stars," and "Luminosity-weighted Stars." Young Stars shows mass-dependent 3D configurations, with spheroidal, elongated, and disky shapes dominant at stellar masses of $10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$, $10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$, and $10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. Using the radiative transfer code SKIRT, we construct mock images for each galaxy and show that projected short-to-long axis ratios, $q$, inferred from 2D S\'ersic fits are most closely related to Luminosity-weighted Stars tensor shapes and least resemble the All Stars' shapes. This suggests observed 2D shape distributions should not be compared to predictions based on 3D stellar mass shapes. Next, we construct a sample of mock images projected in random orientations and compare them to observed axis ratio distributions from the GAMA survey. At stellar masses below $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, we produce too few galaxies with observed $q&lt;0.4$ and none with $q&lt;0.2$, suggesting that FIREbox does not produce enough low-mass disk galaxies. At higher masses, $10^{10} - 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, we find that the predicted q distribution is sensitive to the dust-to-metal ratio; using our fiducial model, the distribution of $q$ values is formally consistent with observations, but there is tension with our ability to produce enough very thin systems with $q&lt;0.2$. Future observational and theoretical programs aimed at understanding disk and thin-disk fractions will provide crucial tests of galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-scale lens search in the PEARLS NEP TDF and CEERS JWST fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four galaxy scale lenses discovered in two JWST blank-fields: the ~ 54 arcmin^2 of the PEARLS North-Ecliptic-Pole Time-Domain Field (NEP TDF) and in the ~ 90 arcmin^2 of CEERS. We perform the search by visual inspection of NIRCam photometric data, obtaining an initial list of 16 lens candidates. We down-select this list to 5 high-confidence lens candidates, based on lens modelling of the image configuration and photometric redshift measurements for both the source and the deflector. We compare our results to samples of lenses obtained in ground-based and space-based lens searches and theoretical expectations. We expect that JWST observations of field galaxies will yield approximately 1 galaxy scale lens every three to four NIRCam pointings of comparable depth to these observations (~ 9 arcmin^2 each). This shows that JWST, compared to other lens searches, can yield an extremely high number of secure lenses per unit area, with redshift and size distributions complementary to lens samples obtained from ground-based and wide-area surveys. We estimate that a single JWST pure-parallel survey of comparable depth could yield $\sim 80$ galaxy scale lenses, with a third of them having z_lens&gt;1 and z_source&gt;3.</description>

      <title>Overmassive black holes in the early Universe can be explained by gas-rich, dark matter-dominated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed the apparent evolution of the black hole (BH)-stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\rm{\ast}$) relation in the early Universe, while remaining consistent with the BH-dynamical mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$) relation. We predict BH masses for $z&gt;3$ galaxies in the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM simulations by assuming the $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation is fundamental. Even without live BH modelling, our approach reproduces the JWST-observed $M_\mathrm{BH}$ distribution, including overmassive BHs relative to the local $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{\ast}$ relation. We find that $M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{\ast}$ declines with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$, evolving from $\sim$0.1 at $M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to $\sim$0.01 at $M_\mathrm{\ast}=10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. This trend reflects the dark matter ($f_\mathrm{DM}$) and gas fractions ($f_\mathrm{gas}$), which decrease with $M_\mathrm{\ast}$ but show little redshift evolution down to $z=3$, resulting in small $M_\mathrm{\ast}/M_\mathrm{dyn}$ ratios and thus overmassive BHs in low-mass galaxies. We use $\texttt{Prospector}$-derived stellar masses and star-formation rates to infer $f_\mathrm{gas}$ across 48,022 galaxies in JADES at $3&lt;z&lt;9$, finding excellent agreement with our simulation. Our results demonstrate that overmassive BHs would naturally result from a fundamental $M_\mathrm{BH}$-$M_\mathrm{dyn}$ relation and be typical of the gas-rich, dark matter-dominated nature of low-mass, high-redshift galaxies. Such overmassive BHs may strongly influence early galaxy formation, and we caution that our approach does not include the self-consistent BH-galaxy co-evolution required for a complete understanding.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Mystery N/O more -- uncovering the origin of peculiar chemical abundances and a not-so-fundamental metallicity relation at $3&lt;z&lt;12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of metallicities and chemical abundances at $3&lt;z&lt;12$ in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations. We find that smoothly curved gas-phase and stellar mass-metallicity relations (MZR) are already in place at $z\approx12$ and evolve slowly ($\sim$0.2 dex increase for gas, $\sim$0.4 dex increase for stars at a fixed stellar mass) down to $z=3$, governed largely by the efficiency with which galaxies retain their metals, rather than gas fraction. The canonical fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) survives in stars but breaks down and inverts for gas in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast\lesssim10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) due to regular dilution by low-metallicity gas inflow. We find broad agreement of gas-phase N/O, Fe/O, and C/O with high-redshift observations, including the presence of nitrogen-rich galaxies (NRGs; $\log(\mathrm{N/O})&gt;-0.6$) without the need for exotic yields in our chemical network. Instead, bursty star formation naturally generates order-of-magnitude excursions in N/O on $\lesssim$100 Myr timescales due to temporally differential galactic winds; after a starburst, stellar feedback expels gas, leaving a large population of asymptotic-giant-branch stars to dominate the enrichment of the relatively low-mass interstellar medium. NRGs lie below the main sequence and typically exhibit $\mathrm{EW}[H$\beta$]\lesssim40$ \r{A}, in apparent tension with observed high-EW NRGs. This tension is reconciled if observed NRGs are in the initial stages of a subsequent starburst, illuminating previously enriched gas, which is supported by the finding of high SFR surface density nitrogen-rich giant molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>VENUS: A Strongly Lensed Clumpy Galaxy at $z\sim11-12$ behind the Galaxy Cluster MACS J0257.1-2325</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a strongly lensed galaxy at $z\sim11-12$, dubbed the ``Misty Moons'', identified in the JWST Treasury Survey, Vast Exploration for Nascent, Unexplored Sources (VENUS). The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at $z=0.505$, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 ($\mu\sim 20-30$), are very bright (F200W$\sim26$ AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Ly$\alpha$ breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-$L^*$ galaxy ($M_{\rm UV}\sim-18.0$ mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has an effective radius of $r_\mathrm{eff}\sim 10-70$ pc and a stellar mass of $\sim10^7\ M_\odot$. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons ($\gtrsim80\%$), similar to other high-$z$ clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxy. The Misty Moons, a lensed galaxy with resolved internal structures, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring the early stages of galaxy formation at $z\gtrsim10$.</description>

      <title>Stellar streams around dwarf galaxies in the Local Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While mergers between massive galaxies and their dwarf satellites are well studied, the properties of dwarf - dwarf satellite mergers are not well constrained. Stellar streams trace satellite disruption and, in the dwarf galaxy regime, are predicted to provide novel constraints on low-mass galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the mass ratios required to form these streams make them challenging to detect. We present a preview of the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey (SSLS) in the dwarf galaxy regime. The SSLS aims to produce a statistically large, homogeneous sample of stellar streams for comparison with galaxy evolution theory. We visually inspect dwarf galaxies using the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (DES and DECaLS footprints, r-band 29 mag arcsec^-2 within 4 - 35 Mpc. We develop a classification metric to categorise accretion debris around dwarf galaxies, and measure the frequency of accretion features in the DES footprint only. We present the first release of accretion features around dwarf galaxies collected from the DES and DECaLS footprints, including 1 stream, 11 shells, and 8 asymmetric stellar halos, of which 17 constitute new identifications. In the DES footprint, we inspect 730 dwarfs and find that 5.1% (37/730) show accretion features. Although this frequency measurement is lower than the SSLS result for massive galaxies, we discuss the observational biases behind detecting streams in the dwarf galaxy regime. Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarfs, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies. Nevertheless, they place constraints on hierarchical mass assembly in this regime.</description>

      <title>ALMAGAL VI. The spatial distribution of dense cores during the evolution of cluster-forming massive clump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-mass stars and star clusters form from the fragmentation of massive dense clumps driven by gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The ALMAGAL project observed $\sim1000$ clumps at $\sim$1000\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $\Lambda_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\sim2.2$, but $e\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $\lambda^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\approx3\times\lambda^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution.</description>

      <title>Lyman Continuum escaping from in-situ formed stars in a tidal bridge at z = 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of archival JWST NIRSpec IFS and HST imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum Emitter (LCE) candidate LACES104037. We show that a nearby galaxy, denoted LACES104037-S, has a redshift offset from the main galaxy by only $\sim 450$ km/s. Together with the identification of tidal bridge features between the galaxies, this indicates that the galaxies are interacting and most likely in the early stages of a merger. We show that the restframe LCE cluster sits in a tidal bridge towards the companion, about 2.7 kpc from the galaxy's core. It is faint in non-ionizing stellar continuum, and shows faint but non-negligible H{\alpha} and [O III] emission, suggesting that much of the gas surrounding the LCE cluster has been dispersed by feedback in the shallower gravitational potential of the tidal bridge. From comparing the direct LyC escape and the local H{\alpha} emission, we find a total ionizing LyC escape fraction of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 57 \pm 8\%$ from the LCE cluster. We estimate the age of the LCE cluster to be $\lesssim 6.5$ Myr, indicating that the cluster must have formed in situ in the tidal bridge well after the time of closest interaction. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features would depend less on intrinsic galaxy properties than typically observed in low-z LCE surveys, and could help explain the higher cosmic escape fraction as well as the enhanced diversity of LCE galaxy properties observed at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>A quiescent galaxy in a gas-rich cosmic web node at z~3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have unveiled a large number of quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$, bringing potential challenges to current galaxy formation models. Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy ($M_\star\simeq10^{11}\,M_\odot$) within the MQN01 structure at z~3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at $z\gtrsim3$. The passive galaxy has a star-formation rate of $4^{+6}_{-2}~M_\odot$/yr, placing it more than 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence, and has no detectable molecular gas ($M_\mathrm{H2}&lt;7\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$). Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the origin of radio emission in candidate super-Eddington accreting black holes</title>

Abstract: Recent works show that the radio power of quasars accreting at very high rates can reach surprisingly high values. These studies suggest that this radio emission might originate from star formation, but lack of data leaves open the possibility that they could also contain a jetted active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate the origin of the radio emission of a sample of 18 super-Eddington candidates, over a wide range of redshifts. These sources are expected to have extreme radiative output per unit black hole mass, show high-velocity outflows and are therefore thought to be a prime mover of galactic evolution via radiative and mechanical feedback. We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations at L, C and X-band of these sources, which we combine with observations from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). We also use optical and IR data to derive estimates of accretion and wind parameters, as well as star formation rates to compare with the ones derived from the radio emission. Based on the radio variability, luminosity, morphology, radio spectral properties, radio vs IR estimates of star formation rate and radio-to-mid IR flux ratio, we find that 7 of our 18 targets are likely to have their radio emission predominantly coming from SF, and 6 from a combination of SF and AGN-related mechanisms, while only three sources indicate a core or jetted AGN only origin for the detected radio emission. This is consistent with previous studies, and supports the prevalence of lower power radio structures associated with star-forming activity rather than relativistic jets in the high Eddington ratio regime. In the same sample, however, we find three sources for which the data suggest a concomitant presence of super-Eddington accretion and relativistic ejections.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: UV-Bright Companions of Little Red Dots as Lyman-Werner Sources Enabling Direct Collapse Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compile a sample of 83 Little Red Dots (LRDs) with JWST imaging and find that a substantial fraction ($\sim$43%, rising to $\gtrsim$85% for the most luminous LRDs) host one or more spatially offset, UV-bright companions at projected separations of $0.5\rm \, kpc \lesssim d\lesssim 5 \rm \,kpc$, with median of $\langle d \rangle = 1.0\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the "synchronized pair" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\ast \sim 10^{8-9}M_\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Broadband infrared spectroscopy of methanol isotopologues in pure, H2O-rich, and CO-rich ice analogues</title>

Abstract: Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (&lt;10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Clustering of z~6.6 Quasars and [O III] Emitters Constrains Host Halo Masses and Duty Cycles in 25 ASPIRE Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use data from the JWST ASPIRE Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) program to measure the auto-correlation function of [O,{\sc iii}] emitters at 5.3$&lt;z&lt;$7.0 and the quasar--[O,{\sc iii}] emitter cross-correlation around 25 ASPIRE quasars (6.51$&lt;z&lt;$6.82; $\langle z\rangle=6.6$). We use synthetic source injection to calibrate the selection function, which we combine with the large-volume FLAMINGO-10k simulation (2.8,cGpc box) to construct realistic mock observations. Our simulation-based approach captures nonlinear structure growth and scale-dependent bias on small scales and derives covariance matrices that include cosmic variance. The clustering yields correlation lengths of $r_0^{\rm GG}=4.7^{+0.4}{-0.5},h^{-1}$,cMpc for the [O,{\sc iii}] auto-correlation with fixed slope $\gamma{\rm GG}=1.8$, and $r_0^{\rm QG}=8.7^{+0.8}{-0.9},h^{-1}$,cMpc for the quasar--[O,{\sc iii}] cross-correlation with $\gamma{\rm QG}=2.0$. We infer $\log(M_{h,{\rm min}}^{[{\rm O,III}]}/M_\odot)=10.5^{+0.1}{-0.1}$ for [O,{\sc iii}] emitters and $\log(M{h,{\rm min}}^{\rm QSO}/M_\odot)=12.1^{+0.3}{-0.4}$ for quasars. These imply duty cycles of $2.5^{+1.0}{-0.8}$,per,cent for [O,{\sc iii}] emitters and $0.3^{+4.0}{-0.3}$,per,cent for quasars, corresponding to UV-bright lifetimes of $t{\rm Q}=2.6^{+30}_{-2.5}$,Myr (less than 10,per,cent of a Salpeter $e$-folding time). The results indicate that the observed UV-luminous phase contributes little to total SMBH growth, placing tight constraints on early black-hole formation.</description>

      <title>Investigating cosmic strings using large-volume hydrodynamical simulations in the context of JWST's massive UV-bright galaxies</title>

Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered an unexpectedly large abundance of massive, UV-bright galaxies at high redshifts, presenting a significant challenge to established galaxy formation models within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Cosmic strings, predicted by a wide range of particle physics theories beyond the Standard Model, provide a promising potential explanation for these observations. They may act as additional gravitational seeds in the early universe, enhancing the process of high-redshift structure formation, potentially resulting in a more substantial population of massive, efficiently star-forming galaxies. We numerically investigate this prediction in large-volume hydrodynamical simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO and the well-tested IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We evaluate the simulation results in the context of recent JWST data and find that sufficiently energetic cosmic strings produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions that are in slightly to substantially better agreement with observations at high redshifts. Moreover, we observe that the halos seeded by cosmic strings exhibit a greater efficiency of star formation and enhanced central concentrations. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the simulations incorporating cosmic strings converge with those from a baseline $\Lambda$CDM model by redshift $z \sim 6$. This convergence suggests that the modified cosmological framework effectively replicates the successful predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at lower redshifts, where observational constraints are significantly stronger. Our results provide compelling evidence that cosmic strings may play a crucial role in explaining the galaxy properties observed by JWST at high redshifts while maintaining consistency with well-established models at later epochs.</description>

      <title>CLASH-VLT: The variance in the velocity anisotropy profiles of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The velocity anisotropy profiles, $\beta(r)$, of galaxy clusters are directly related to the shape of the orbits of their member galaxies. Knowledge of $\beta(r)$ is important to understand the assembly process of clusters and the evolutionary processes of their galaxies, and to improve the determination of cluster masses based on cluster kinematics. We determined the $\beta(r)$ of nine massive clusters at redshift $0.19 \leq z \leq 0.45$ from the CLASH-VLT data set, with 150 to 950 spectroscopic members each. We selected spectroscopic cluster members with the CLUMPS algorithm calibrated on cosmological simulations. We applied the MAMPOSSt code to the distribution of cluster members in projected phase-space to constrain the cluster mass profile, $M(r)$, using priors derived from a previous gravitational lensing analysis. Given the MAMPOSSt best-fit solution for $M(r)$, we then solved the inversion of the Jeans equation to determine $\beta(r)$ without assumptions of its functional form. We also ran the DS+ code to identify subclusters and characterize the dynamical status of our clusters. The average $\beta(r)$ is slightly radial, with the anisotropy increasing from $\beta \simeq 0.2$ at the cluster center, to $\beta \simeq 0.5$ at the virial radius. There is substantial variance in the $\beta(r)$ of the individual clusters, that cannot be entirely accounted for by the observational uncertainties. Clusters of lower mass and with a low concentration per given mass have more tangential $\beta(r)$. A comparison with cluster-sized halos in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations indicates a very good agreement for the average $\beta(r)$, but a smaller variance in the profiles than observed. We conclude that massive clusters cannot be characterized by a unique universal $\beta(r)$ and that the orbital distribution of cluster galaxies carries information on the merging history of the cluster.</description>

      <title>Can an Anti-de Sitter Vacuum in the Dark Energy Sector Explain JWST High-Redshift Galaxy and Reionization Observations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unexpectedly large abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$ discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope poses a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This work tests whether modifying the cosmological background, and thereby the growth of structures, can resolve this tension without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring an anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, which naturally arises in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of observations. We show that while a model tailored to fit the high-$z$ UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) appears promising, it is in strong tension with cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift probes. Conversely, models within this framework that satisfy these constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to reproduce the observed galaxy abundances at $z&gt;10$. Although these models remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, we find that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the importance of holistic testing for any beyond-$\Lambda$CDM proposal; apparent success in one observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving the challenge of early galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in the Near Future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z &gt; 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $10.4\sigma$ (and $29.8\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.</description>

Abstract: Can a dynamically robust (\textit{aka} stable) $Q$-ball reproduce the rotation curve of a disk galaxy? In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the axially-symmetric structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data, and a reasonable fit when compared to standard dark matter profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions.</description>

Abstract: For more than 40 years the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major focus of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale non-linear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo at large magnetic Reynolds numbers, $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm&gt;1$ and $Pm&lt;1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical set-ups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in non-asymptotic turbulent magnetohydrodynamic regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach the ultimate regime in such 'realistic' global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.</description>

      <title>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a near-infrared time-domain survey instrument operating on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for wide-field science in the near infrared without cryogenically cooled optics or detectors. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 deg^2 field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</description>

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object whose activity provides critical insights into its composition and origin. However, due to its orbital geometry, the object is too close to the Sun near perihelion to be observed from the ground, and space-based measurements are therefore required. Here we characterize the water production rate of 3I/ATLAS using SOHO/SWAN Lyman-$\alpha$ observations from 2025 November to December (heliocentric distances 1.4 to 2.2 au) with 3D Monte Carlo modeling. We report a peak post-perihelion water production rate of $Q_{\mathrm{H_2O}} \approx 4 \times 10^{28}$ molecules~s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a minimum active fraction of $\sim$30\% (assuming a maximum nucleus radius of 2.8 km). Comparison of our post-perihelion measurements with published pre-perihelion results reveals a heliocentric asymmetry, with an $r^{-5.9 \pm 0.8}$ scaling for the inbound rise, followed by a shallower $r^{-3.3 \pm 0.3}$ scaling during the outbound decline, where $r$ is heliocentric distance. The post-perihelion behavior indicates that the water production of 3I/ATLAS was driven primarily by the varying solar insolation acting on a stable active area. Combined with other evidence, including comparison with the hyperactive comet 103P/Hartley 2, our findings suggest that its water production is likely dominated by a distributed source of icy grains. Furthermore, it displayed remarkable stability in the activity with no signs of outbursts or rapid depletion of water production.</description>
