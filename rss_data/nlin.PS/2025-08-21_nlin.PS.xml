      <title>Vacuum bubble and fissure formation in collective motion with competing attractive and repulsive forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the continuum limit of the motion of agents in the plane driven by competing short-range repulsion and long-range attractive forces. At a critical parameter value, we find destabilization of a trivial branch of uniformly distributed solutions and analyze bifurcating solutions. Curiously, the bifurcating branch is vertical, leading to a reversible, non-hysteretic phase transition. Near the bifurcation point, we demonstrate scaling laws for the size of vacuum regions, which can form fissures or bubbles. We also study the effect of small noise and the eventual topological transition from vacuum bubbles to isolated particle clusters.</description>

      <title>Pulled fronts are not (just) pulled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Front propagation into unstable states is often determined by the linearization, that is, propagation speeds agree with predictions from the linearized equation at the unstable state. The leading edge behavior is then a Gaussian tail propagating with the linear spreading speed. Fronts following this leading edge are commonly referred to as pulled fronts, alluding to the idea that they are ``pulled'' by this leading-edge Gaussian tail. We describe here a class of examples that exhibits how these leading-order effects do not completely describe the dynamics in the wake of the front. In fact, leading edge behavior predicts at most two possible invasion scenarios, associated with positive and negative amplitudes of the Gaussian tail, but our examples exhibit three or more invasion fronts with different states in the wake. The resulting invasion process therefore leaves behind a state that is not solely determined by the leading edge, and thus not just pulled by the Gaussian tail.</description>
