      <title>A Couple of Simple Algorithms for $k$-Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbf{R}^d$, and a positive integer $k \leq n$, the $k$-dispersion problem is that of selecting $k$ of the given points so that the minimum inter-point distance among them is maximized (under Euclidean distances). Among others, we show the following:
  (I) Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, and a positive integer $k \geq 2$, the $k$-dispersion problem can be solved by an algorithm running in $O\left(n^{k-1} \log{n}\right)$ time. This extends an earlier result for $k=3$, due to Horiyama, Nakano, Saitoh, Suetsugu, Suzuki, Uehara, Uno, and Wasa (2021) to arbitrary $k$. In particular, it improves on previous running times for small $k$.
  (II) Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbf{R}^3$, and a positive integer $k \geq 2$, the $k$-dispersion problem can be solved by an algorithm running in $O\left(n^{k-1} \log{n}\right)$ time, if $k$ is even; and $O\left(n^{k-1} \log^2{n}\right)$ time, if $k$ is odd. For $k \geq 4$, no combinatorial algorithm running in $o(n^k)$ time was known for this problem.
  (III) Let $P$ be a set of $n$ random points uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^2$. Then under suitable conditions, a $0.99$-approximation for $k$-dispersion can be computed in $O(n)$ time with high probability.</description>

      <title>NP-membership for the boundary-boundary art-gallery problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary-boundary art-gallery problem asks, given a polygon $P$ representing an art-gallery, for a minimal set of guards that can see the entire boundary of $P$ (the wall of the art gallery), where the guards must be placed on the boundary. We show that this art-gallery variant is in NP. In order to prove this, we develop a constraint-propagation procedure for continuous constraint satisfaction problems where each constraint involves at most 2 variables.
  The X-Y variant of the art-gallery problem is the one where the guards must lie in X and need to see all of Y. Each of X and Y can be either the vertices of the polygon, the boundary of the polygon, or the entire polygon, giving 9 different variants. Previously, it was known that X-vertex and vertex-Y variants are all NP-complete and that the point-point, point-boundary, and boundary-point variants are $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete [Abrahamsen, Adamaszek, and Miltzow, JACM 2021][Stade, SoCG 2025]. However, the boundary-boundary variant was only known to lie somewhere between NP and $\exists \mathbb{R}$.
  The X-vertex and vertex-Y variants can be straightforwardly reduced to discrete set-cover instances. In contrast, we give example to show that a solution to an instance of the boundary-boundary art-gallery problem sometimes requires placing guards at irrational coordinates, so it unlikely that the problem can be easily discretized.</description>

      <title>Symplectifying Biarcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up article to Symplectification of Circular Arcs and Arc Splines, biarc geometry is examined from a purely geometric point of view. Two given points together with their associated tangent vectors in the plane are sufficient to define two directed, consecutive circular arcs. However, there remains one degree of freedom to determine the join point of both arcs. There are various approaches to this in the literature. A novel one is presented here.</description>

      <title>Uncrossed Multiflows and Applications to Disjoint Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiflow in a planar graph is uncrossed if the curves identified by its support paths do not cross in the plane. Such flows have played a role in previous routing algorithms, including Schrijver's Homotopy Method and unsplittable flows in directed planar single-source instances. Recently uncrossed flows have played a key role in approximation algorithms for maximum disjoint paths in fully-planar instances, where the combined supply plus demand graph is planar. In the fully-planar case, any fractional multiflow can be converted into one that is uncrossed, which is then exploited to find a good rounding of the fractional solution. We investigate finding an uncrossed multiflow as a standalone algorithmic problem in general planar instances (not necessarily fully-planar). We consider both a congestion model where the given demands must all be routed, and a maximization model where the goal is to pack as much flow in the supply graph as possible (not necessarily equitably).
  For the congestion model, we show that determining if an instance has an uncrossed (fractional) multiflow is NP-hard, but the problem of finding an integral uncrossed flow is polytime solvable if the demands span a bounded number of faces. For the maximization model, we present a strong (almost polynomial) inapproximability result. Regarding integrality gaps, for maximization we show that an uncrossed multiflow in a planar instance can always be rounded to an integral multiflow with a constant fraction of the original value. This holds in both the edge-capacitated and node-capacitated settings, and generalizes earlier bounds for fully-planar instances. In the congestion model, given an uncrossed fractional multiflow, we give a rounding procedure that produces an integral multiflow with edge congestion 2, which can be made unsplittable with an additional additive error of the maximum demand.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Chamanara Surface from the van der Corput sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of $4$-regular graphs constructed to test for the presence of combinatorial structure in a sequence of distinct real numbers. We show that the graphs constructed from the Kronecker sequence can be embedded into the torus, while the graphs constructed from the binary van der Corput sequence can be embedded into the Chamanara surface, in both cases with the possible removal of one edge. These results allude to a general theory of sequence graphs which can be embedded into particular translation surfaces coming from interval exchange transformations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional narrow volume reconstruction method with unconditional stability based on a phase-field Lagrange multiplier approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction of an object from points cloud is essential in prosthetics, medical imaging, computer vision, etc. We present an effective algorithm for an Allen--Cahn-type model of reconstruction, employing the Lagrange multiplier approach. Utilizing scattered data points from an object, we reconstruct a narrow shell by solving the governing equation enhanced with an edge detection function derived from the unsigned distance function. The specifically designed edge detection function ensures the energy stability. By reformulating the governing equation through the Lagrange multiplier technique and implementing a Crank--Nicolson time discretization, we can update the solutions in a stable and decoupled manner. The spatial operations are approximated using the finite difference method, and we analytically demonstrate the unconditional stability of the fully discrete scheme. Comprehensive numerical experiments, including reconstructions of complex 3D volumes such as characters from \textit{Star Wars}, validate the algorithm's accuracy, stability, and effectiveness. Additionally, we analyze how specific parameter selections influence the level of detail and refinement in the reconstructed volumes. To facilitate the interested readers to understand our algorithm, we share the computational codes and data in https://github.com/cfdyang521/C-3PO/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Computing the Polytope Diameter is Even Harder than NP-hard (Already for Perfect Matchings)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of a polytope is a fundamental geometric parameter that plays a crucial role in understanding the efficiency of the simplex method. Despite its central nature, the computational complexity of computing the diameter of a given polytope is poorly understood. Already in 1994, Frieze and Teng [Comp. Compl.] recognized the possibility that this task could potentially be harder than NP-hard, and asked whether the corresponding decision problem is complete for the second stage of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e. $\Pi^p_2$-complete. In the following years, partial results could be obtained. In a cornerstone result, Frieze and Teng themselves proved weak NP-hardness for a family of custom defined polytopes. Sanit\`a [FOCS18] in a break-through result proved that already for the much simpler fractional matching polytope the problem is strongly NP-hard. Very recently, Steiner and N\"obel [SODA25] generalized this result to the even simpler bipartite perfect matching polytope and the circuit diameter. In this paper, we finally show that computing the diameter of the bipartite perfect matching polytope is $\Pi^p_2$-hard. Since the corresponding decision problem is also trivially contained in $\Pi^p_2$, this decidedly answers Frieze and Teng's 30 year old question. Our results also hold when the diameter is replaced by the circuit diameter. As our second main result, we prove that for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ the (circuit) diameter of the bipartite perfect matching polytope cannot be approximated by a factor better than $(1 + \varepsilon)$. This answers a recent question by N\"obel and Steiner. It is the first known inapproximability result for the circuit diameter, and extends Sanit\`a's inapproximability result of the diameter to the totally unimodular case.</description>
