      <title>TinyUSFM: Towards Compact and Efficient Ultrasound Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models for medical imaging demonstrate superior generalization capabilities across diverse anatomical structures and clinical applications. Their outstanding performance relies on substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. This paper presents TinyUSFM, the first lightweight ultrasound foundation model that maintains superior organ versatility and task adaptability of our large-scale Ultrasound Foundation Model (USFM) through knowledge distillation with strategically curated small datasets, delivering significant computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Considering the limited capacity and representation ability of lightweight models, we propose a feature-gradient driven coreset selection strategy to curate high-quality compact training data, avoiding training degradation from low-quality redundant images. To preserve the essential spatial and frequency domain characteristics during knowledge transfer, we develop domain-separated masked image modeling assisted consistency-driven dynamic distillation. This novel framework adaptively transfers knowledge from large foundation models by leveraging teacher model consistency across different domain masks, specifically tailored for ultrasound interpretation. For evaluation, we establish the UniUS-Bench, the largest publicly available ultrasound benchmark comprising 8 classification and 10 segmentation datasets across 15 organs. Using only 200K images in distillation, TinyUSFM matches USFM's performance with just 6.36% of parameters and 6.40% of GFLOPs. TinyUSFM significantly outperforms the vanilla model by 9.45% in classification and 7.72% in segmentation, surpassing all state-of-the-art lightweight models, and achieving 84.91% average classification accuracy and 85.78% average segmentation Dice score across diverse medical devices and centers.</description>

      <title>Automated Morphological Analysis of Neurons in Fluorescence Microscopy Using YOLOv8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy, exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research, reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise quantification of neuron morphology.</description>

      <title>Res-DPU: Resource-shared Digital Processing-in-memory Unit for Edge-AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as the go to solution for addressing the von Neumann bottleneck in edge AI accelerators. However, state-of-the-art (SoTA) digital PIM approaches suffer from low compute density, primarily due to the use of bulky bit cells and transistor-heavy adder trees, which impose limitations on macro scalability and energy efficiency. This work introduces Res-DPU, a resource-shared digital PIM unit, with a dual-port 5T SRAM latch and shared 2T AND compute logic. This reflects the per-bit multiplication cost to just 5.25T and reduced the transistor count of the PIM array by up to 56% over the SoTA works. Furthermore, a Transistor-Reduced 2D Interspersed Adder Tree (TRAIT) with FA-7T and PG-FA-26T helps reduce the power consumption of the adder tree by up to 21.35% and leads to improved energy efficiency by 59% compared to conventional 28T RCA designs. We propose a Cycle-controlled Iterative Approximate-Accurate Multiplication (CIA2M) approach, enabling run-time accuracy-latency trade-offs without requiring error-correction circuitry. The 16 KB REP-DPIM macro achieves 0.43 TOPS throughput and 87.22 TOPS/W energy efficiency in TSMC 65nm CMOS, with 96.85% QoR for ResNet-18 or VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, including 30% pruning. The proposed results establish a Res-DPU module for highly scalable and energy-efficient real-time edge AI accelerators.</description>

      <title>Discretized Gaussian Representation for Tomographic Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) enables detailed cross-sectional imaging but continues to face challenges in balancing reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. While deep learning-based methods have significantly improved image quality and noise reduction, they typically require large-scale training data and intensive computation. Recent advances in scene reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer alternative perspectives but are not well-suited for direct volumetric CT reconstruction. In this work, we propose Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR), a novel framework that reconstructs the 3D volume directly using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce Fast Volume Reconstruction, a highly parallelized technique that aggregates Gaussian contributions into the voxel grid with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DGR achieves superior reconstruction quality and runtime performance across various CT reconstruction scenarios. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/wskingdom/DGR.</description>

      <title>Fast MRI for All: Bridging Access Gaps by Training without Raw Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to rare pathologies or different populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and under-resourced areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide broader access to fast MRI for remote and rural populations in an attempt to reduce the obstacles associated with this expensive imaging modality.</description>

      <title>Advancing Image Super-resolution Techniques in Remote Sensing: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote sensing image processing, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Despite the growing number of RSISR methods proposed in recent years, a systematic and comprehensive review of these methods is still lacking. This paper presents a thorough review of RSISR algorithms, covering methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We provide an in-depth analysis of RSISR methods, categorizing them into supervised, unsupervised, and quality evaluation approaches, to help researchers understand current trends and challenges. Our review also discusses the strengths, limitations, and inherent challenges of these techniques. Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods, particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under large-scale degradation. Based on these findings, we outline future research directions, highlighting the need for domain-specific architectures and robust evaluation protocols to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RSISR scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This abstract presents our solution (Team Westwood) for mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification in the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge. For mitosis detection, we trained an nnUNetV2 for initial mitosis candidate screening with high sensitivity, followed by a random forest classifier ensembling predictions of three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and EfficientNetV2-s. For the atypical mitosis classification, we trained another random forest classifier ensembling the predictions of three CNNs: EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and InceptionV3. On the preliminary test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.7450 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8722 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification. On the final test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.6972 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8242 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification.</description>

      <title>Untangling Vascular Trees for Surgery and Interventional Radiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of minimally invasive, endovascular interventions motivates the development of visualization methods for complex vascular networks. We propose a planar representation of blood vessel trees which preserves the properties that are most relevant to catheter navigation: topology, length and curvature. Taking as input a three-dimensional digital angiography, our algorithm produces a faithful two-dimensional map of the patient's vessels within a few seconds. To this end, we propose optimized implementations of standard morphological filters and a new recursive embedding algorithm that preserves the global orientation of the vascular network. We showcase our method on peroperative images of the brain, pelvic and knee artery networks. On the clinical side, our method simplifies the choice of devices prior to and during the intervention. This lowers the risk of failure during navigation or device deployment and may help to reduce the gap between expert and common intervention centers. From a research perspective, our method simulates the cadaveric display of artery trees from anatomical dissections. This opens the door to large population studies on the branching patterns and tortuosity of fine human blood vessels. Our code is released under the permissive MIT license as part of the scikit-shapes Python library (https://scikit-shapes.github.io ).</description>

      <title>Variable Rate Image Compression via N-Gram Context based Swin-transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single model. By incorporating N-gram context into the Swin Transformer, we overcome its limitation of neglecting larger regions during high-resolution image reconstruction due to its restricted receptive field. This enhancement expands the regions considered for pixel restoration, thereby improving the quality of high-resolution reconstructions. Our method increases context awareness across neighboring windows, leading to a -5.86\% improvement in BD-Rate over existing variable-rate learned image compression techniques. Additionally, our model improves the quality of regions of interest (ROI) in images, making it particularly beneficial for object-focused applications in fields such as manufacturing and industrial vision systems.</description>

      <title>LookUp3D: Data-Driven 3D Scanning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High speed, high-resolution, and accurate 3D scanning would open doors to many new applications in graphics, robotics, science, and medicine by enabling the accurate scanning of deformable objects during interactions. Past attempts to use structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo in high-speed settings have usually required tradeoffs in resolution or inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables, for the first time, 3D scanning at 450 frames per second at 1~Megapixel, or 1,450 frames per second at 0.4~Megapixel in an environment with controlled lighting. The key idea is to use a per-pixel lookup table that maps colors to depths, which is built using a linear stage. Imperfections, such as lens-distortion and sensor defects are baked into the calibration. We describe our method and test it on a novel hardware prototype. We compare the system with both ground-truth geometry as well as commercially available dynamic sensors like the Microsoft Kinect and Intel Realsense. Our results show the system acquiring geometry of objects undergoing high-speed deformations and oscillations and demonstrate the ability to recover physical properties from the reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Learning Differential Pyramid Representation for Tone Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing tone mapping methods operate on downsampled inputs and rely on handcrafted pyramids to recover high-frequency details. These designs typically fail to preserve fine textures and structural fidelity in complex HDR scenes. Furthermore, most methods lack an effective mechanism to jointly model global tone consistency and local contrast enhancement, leading to globally flat or locally inconsistent outputs such as halo artifacts. We present the Differential Pyramid Representation Network (DPRNet), an end-to-end framework for high-fidelity tone mapping. At its core is a learnable differential pyramid that generalizes traditional Laplacian and Difference-of-Gaussian pyramids through content-aware differencing operations across scales. This allows DPRNet to adaptively capture high-frequency variations under diverse luminance and contrast conditions. To enforce perceptual consistency, DPRNet incorporates global tone perception and local tone tuning modules operating on downsampled inputs, enabling efficient yet expressive tone adaptation. Finally, an iterative detail enhancement module progressively restores the full-resolution output in a coarse-to-fine manner, reinforcing structure and sharpness. Experiments show that DPRNet achieves state-of-the-art results, improving PSNR by 2.39 dB on the 4K HDR+ dataset and 3.01 dB on the 4K HDRI Haven dataset, while producing perceptually coherent, detail-preserving results. \textit{We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxxdprnet.github.io/DPRNet/.</description>

Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Software System for Low-Cost, Brightfield Segmentation: Algorithmic Implementation for Cytometric Auto-Analysis</title>

Abstract: Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent chal- lenges of bright-field images - their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology - coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis frame- work designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular archi- tecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications - particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility</description>

Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>
