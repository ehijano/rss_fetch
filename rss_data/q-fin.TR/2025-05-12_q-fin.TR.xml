      <title>Impact of Tariff Wars on Global Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ricardian model of world trade based on comparative advantage is not sufficient to justify equal trade relations.The existing model of trade relations does not explain the distribution of income among trading countries. This paper presents a method for building equitable trade relations. Its essence is to present an algorithm for building such trade relations, based on the previously proposed model of world trade, that the trade balance of each country would be equal to zero. Under such conditions, tariff wars would become impossible. It is proved that, provided that the supply structure is consistent with the demand structure, it is always possible to build an equilibrium price vector for which the trade balance of each country is zero. This state of economic equilibrium is called ideal. The article presents an algorithm to build an export structure based on the structure of imports. This algorithm is quite simple and allows for a wide range of applications. Under fairly simple realistic assumptions about the behaviour of countries trading with each other that are subject to tariff restrictions, it is proved that this leads to an increase in the prices of the goods traded by these countries. Among the equilibrium states, there are also those called oversupply states. The latter describes the phenomenon of recession. This contributes to a fall in stock market indices.</description>

      <title>Trading Under Uncertainty: A Distribution-Based Strategy for Futures Markets Using FutureQuant Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the complex landscape of traditional futures trading, where vast data and variables like real-time Limit Order Books (LOB) complicate price predictions, we introduce the FutureQuant Transformer model, leveraging attention mechanisms to navigate these challenges. Unlike conventional models focused on point predictions, the FutureQuant model excels in forecasting the range and volatility of future prices, thus offering richer insights for trading strategies. Its ability to parse and learn from intricate market patterns allows for enhanced decision-making, significantly improving risk management and achieving a notable average gain of 0.1193% per 30-minute trade over state-of-the-art models with a simple algorithm using factors such as RSI, ATR, and Bollinger Bands. This innovation marks a substantial leap forward in predictive analytics within the volatile domain of futures trading.</description>

      <title>FlowHFT: Flow Policy Induced Optimal High-Frequency Trading under Diverse Market Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously monitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds. Traditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that future market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of any single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally, these models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions, such as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow, and the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic, diverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the FlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy. FlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each proficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can adaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market state. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism. This allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in complex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal. We test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow matching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling FlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions. Notably, our single framework consistently achieves performance superior to the best expert for each market condition.</description>

      <title>Loss-Versus-Rebalancing under Deterministic and Generalized block-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although modern blockchains almost universally produce blocks at fixed intervals, existing models still lack an analytical formula for the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) incurred by Automated Market Makers (AMMs) liquidity providers in this setting. Leveraging tools from random walk theory, we derive the following closed-form approximation for the per block per unit of liquidity expected LVR under constant block time:
  \[ \overline{\mathrm{ARB}}= \frac{\,\sigma_b^{2}} {\,2+\sqrt{2\pi}\,\gamma/(|\zeta(1/2)|\,\sigma_b)\,}+O\!\bigl(e^{-\mathrm{const}\tfrac{\gamma}{\sigma_b}}\bigr)\;\approx\; \frac{\sigma_b^{2}}{\,2 + 1.7164\,\gamma/\sigma_b}, \] where $\sigma_b$ is the intra-block asset volatility, $\gamma$ the AMM spread and $\zeta$ the Riemann Zeta function. Our large Monte Carlo simulations show that this formula is in fact quasi-exact across practical parameter ranges.
  Extending our analysis to arbitrary block-time distributions as well, we demonstrate both that--under every admissible inter-block law--the probability that a block carries an arbitrage trade converges to a universal limit, and that only constant block spacing attains the asymptotically minimal LVR. This shows that constant block intervals provide the best possible protection against arbitrage for liquidity providers.</description>
