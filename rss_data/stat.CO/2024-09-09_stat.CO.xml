      <title>A Unified Framework for Cluster Methods with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Tensor Networks (TN) are two powerful frameworks for numerically investigating many-body systems, each offering distinct advantages. MCMC, with its flexibility and theoretical consistency, is well-suited for simulating arbitrary systems by sampling. TN, on the other hand, provides a powerful tensor-based language for capturing the entanglement properties intrinsic to many-body systems, offering a universal representation of these systems. In this work, we leverage the computational strengths of TN to design a versatile cluster MCMC sampler. Specifically, we propose a general framework for constructing tensor-based cluster MCMC methods, enabling arbitrary cluster updates by utilizing TNs to compute the distributions required in the MCMC sampler. Our framework unifies several existing cluster algorithms as special cases and allows for natural extensions. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the simulation of the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Model and the three-dimensional Ising Model. This work is dedicated to the memory of Prof. David Draper.</description>

      <title>Inference for Large Scale Regression Models with Dependent Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth in data sizes and storage costs has brought considerable challenges to the data science community, requiring solutions to run learning methods on such data. While machine learning has scaled to achieve predictive accuracy in big data settings, statistical inference and uncertainty quantification tools are still lagging. Priority scientific fields collect vast data to understand phenomena typically studied with statistical methods like regression. In this setting, regression parameter estimation can benefit from efficient computational procedures, but the main challenge lies in computing error process parameters with complex covariance structures. Identifying and estimating these structures is essential for inference and often used for uncertainty quantification in machine learning with Gaussian Processes. However, estimating these structures becomes burdensome as data scales, requiring approximations that compromise the reliability of outputs. These approximations are even more unreliable when complexities like long-range dependencies or missing data are present. This work defines and proves the statistical properties of the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments with Exogenous variables (GMWMX), a highly scalable, stable, and statistically valid method for estimating and delivering inference for linear models using stochastic processes in the presence of data complexities like latent dependence structures and missing data. Applied examples from Earth Sciences and extensive simulations highlight the advantages of the GMWMX.</description>

      <title>Improving Tree Probability Estimation with Stochastic Optimization and Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probability estimation of tree topologies is one of the fundamental tasks in phylogenetic inference. The recently proposed subsplit Bayesian networks (SBNs) provide a powerful probabilistic graphical model for tree topology probability estimation by properly leveraging the hierarchical structure of phylogenetic trees. However, the expectation maximization (EM) method currently used for learning SBN parameters does not scale up to large data sets. In this paper, we introduce several computationally efficient methods for training SBNs and show that variance reduction could be the key for better performance. Furthermore, we also introduce the variance reduction technique to improve the optimization of SBN parameters for variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI). Extensive synthetic and real data experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform previous baseline methods on the tasks of tree topology probability estimation as well as Bayesian phylogenetic inference using SBNs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing VarLiNGAM for Scalable and Efficient Time Series Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery is designed to identify causal relationships in data, a task that has become increasingly complex due to the computational demands of traditional methods such as VarLiNGAM, which combines Vector Autoregressive Model with Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model for time series data.
  This study is dedicated to optimising causal discovery specifically for time series data, which is common in practical applications. Time series causal discovery is particularly challenging due to the need to account for temporal dependencies and potential time lag effects. By designing a specialised dataset generator and reducing the computational complexity of the VarLiNGAM model from \( O(m^3 \cdot n) \) to \( O(m^3 + m^2 \cdot n) \), this study significantly improves the feasibility of processing large datasets. The proposed methods have been validated on advanced computational platforms and tested across simulated, real-world, and large-scale datasets, showcasing enhanced efficiency and performance. The optimised algorithm achieved 7 to 13 times speedup compared with the original algorithm and around 4.5 times speedup compared with the GPU-accelerated version on large-scale datasets with feature sizes between 200 and 400.
  Our methods aim to push the boundaries of current causal discovery capabilities, making them more robust, scalable, and applicable to real-world scenarios, thus facilitating breakthroughs in various fields such as healthcare and finance.</description>

      <title>Principles of Statistical Inference in Online Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate a dilemma of statistical and computational efficiency faced by long-run variance estimators, we propose a decomposition of kernel weights in a quadratic form and some online inference principles. These proposals allow us to characterize efficient online long-run variance estimators. Our asymptotic theory and simulations show that this principle-driven approach leads to online estimators with a uniformly lower mean squared error than all existing works. We also discuss practical enhancements such as mini-batch and automatic updates to handle fast streaming data and optimal parameters tuning. Beyond variance estimation, we consider the proposals in the context of online quantile regression, online change point detection, Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnosis, and stochastic approximation. Substantial improvements in computational cost and finite-sample statistical properties are observed when we apply our principle-driven variance estimator to original and modified inference procedures.</description>

      <title>Guarantees for Comprehensive Simulation Assessment of Statistical Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation can evaluate a statistical method for properties such as Type I Error, FDR, or bias on a grid of hypothesized parameter values. But what about the gaps between the grid-points? Continuous Simulation Extension (CSE) is a proof-by-simulation framework which can supplement simulations with (1) confidence bands valid over regions of parameter space or (2) calibration of rejection thresholds to provide rigorous proof of strong Type I Error control. CSE extends simulation estimates at grid-points into bounds over nearby space using a model shift bound related to the Renyi divergence, which we analyze for models in exponential family or canonical GLM form. CSE can work with adaptive sampling, nuisance parameters, administrative censoring, multiple arms, multiple testing, Bayesian randomization, Bayesian decision-making, and inference algorithms of arbitrary complexity. As a case study, we calibrate for strong Type I Error control a Phase II/III Bayesian selection design with 4 unknown statistical parameters. Potential applications include calibration of new statistical procedures or streamlining regulatory review of adaptive trial designs.

      <title>Copula Approximate Bayesian Computation Using Distribution Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This invited feature article introduces and provides an extensive simulation study of a new Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework for estimating the posterior distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameters of models defined by intractable likelihoods, which unifies and extends previous ABC method. This framework, copulaABcdrf, aims to accurately estimate and describe the possibly skewed and high dimensional posterior distribution by a novel multivariate copula-based meta-\textit{t} distribution, based on univariate marginal posterior distributions which can be accurately estimated by Distribution Random Forests (drf), while performing automatic summary statistics (covariates) selection, and robust estimation of copula dependence parameters. The copulaABcdrf framework also provides a novel multivariate mode estimator to perform MLE and posterior mode estimation, and an optional step to perform model selection from a given set of models using posterior probabilities estimated by drf. The posterior distribution estimation accuracy of copulaABcdrf is illustrated and compared to standard ABC methods, through several simulation studies involving low- and high-dimensional models with computable posterior distributions, which are either unimodal, skewed, or multimodal; and exponential random graph and mechanistic network models, each defined by an intractable likelihood from which it is costly to simulate large network datasets. We also study a new solution to the simulation cost problem in ABC. The copulaABcdrf framework and standard ABC methods are further illustrated through analyses of large real-life networks. The results of the simulation and empirical studies, and their implications for future research, are summarized. Keywords: Bayesian analysis, Maximum Likelihood, Intractable likelihood.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: I. Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the most fundamental problem in statistics, robust location estimation has many prominent solutions, such as the trimmed mean, Winsorized mean, Hodges Lehmann estimator, Huber M estimator, and median of means. Recent studies suggest that their maximum biases concerning the mean can be quite different, but the underlying mechanisms largely remain unclear. This study exploited a semiparametric method to classify distributions by the asymptotic orderliness of quantile combinations with varying breakdown points, showing their interrelations and connections to parametric distributions. Further deductions explain why the Winsorized mean typically has smaller biases compared to the trimmed mean; two sequences of semiparametric robust mean estimators emerge, particularly highlighting the superiority of the median Hodges Lehmann mean. This article sheds light on the understanding of the common nature of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>sfislands: An R Package for Accommodating Islands and Disjoint Zones in Areal Spatial Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting areal models which use a spatial weights matrix to represent relationships between geographical units can be a cumbersome task, particularly when these units are not well-behaved. The two chief aims of sfislands are to simplify the process of creating an appropriate neighbourhood matrix, and to quickly visualise the predictions of subsequent models. The package uses visual aids in the form of easily-generated maps to help this process. This paper demonstrates how sfislands could be useful to researchers. It begins by describing the package's functions in the context of a proposed workflow. It then presents three worked examples showing a selection of potential use-cases. These range from earthquakes in Indonesia, to river crossings in London, and hierarchical models of output areas in Liverpool. We aim to show how the sfislands package streamlines much of the human workflow involved in creating and examining such models.</description>

      <title>Beyond the noise: intrinsic dimension estimation with optimal neighbourhood identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Intrinsic Dimension (ID) is a key concept in unsupervised learning and feature selection, as it is a lower bound to the number of variables which are necessary to describe a system. However, in almost any real-world dataset the ID depends on the scale at which the data are analysed. Quite typically at a small scale, the ID is very large, as the data are affected by measurement errors. At large scale, the ID can also be erroneously large, due to the curvature and the topology of the manifold containing the data. In this work, we introduce an automatic protocol to select the sweet spot, namely the correct range of scales in which the ID is meaningful and useful. This protocol is based on imposing that for distances smaller than the correct scale the density of the data is constant. In the presented framework, to estimate the density it is necessary to know the ID, therefore, this condition is imposed self-consistently. We derive theoretical guarantees and illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this procedure by benchmarks on artificial and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification under Noisy Constraints, with Applications to Raking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider statistical inference problems under uncertain equality constraints, and provide asymptotically valid uncertainty estimates for inferred parameters. The proposed approach leverages the implicit function theorem and primal-dual optimality conditions for a particular problem class. The motivating application is multi-dimensional raking, where observations are adjusted to match marginals; for example, adjusting estimated deaths across race, county, and cause in order to match state all-race all-cause totals. We review raking from a convex optimization perspective, providing explicit primal-dual formulations, algorithms, and optimality conditions for a wide array of raking applications, which are then leveraged to obtain the uncertainty estimates. Empirical results show that the approach obtains, at the cost of a single solve, nearly the same uncertainty estimates as computationally intensive Monte Carlo techniques that pass thousands of observed and of marginal draws through the entire raking process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction is often the first step in statistical modeling or prediction of multivariate spatial data. However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</description>
