      <title>Can social capital remedy structural inequality? Economic mobility in a longitudinal population-scale social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of equal opportunity is a cornerstone of modern societies, yet upward economic mobility remains out of reach for many. Using a decade of population-scale social network data from the Netherlands, covering over a billion family, school, workplace, and neighborhood ties, we examine how structural inequality and social capital jointly shape economic trajectories. Parental background is a strong early predictor of economic outcomes, but its influence fades over time. In contrast, bridging social capital is what positively predicts long-term mobility, particularly for economically disadvantaged groups. Reducing the dimensionality of an individual's network composition, we identify two key dimensions: exposure to affluent contacts and socioeconomic diversity of one's network. These are sufficient to capture the core aspects of social capital that matter for economic mobility. Overall, our findings demonstrate that while inherited advantage shapes the starting point of economic trajectory, social capital can powerfully reshape it, especially for the poor.</description>

      <title>Exploring epidemic control policies using nonlinear programming and mathematical models</title>

Abstract: Optimal control theory in epidemiology has been used to establish the most effective intervention strategies for managing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases while considering constraints and costs. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, indirect methods provide necessary optimality conditions by transforming the control problem into a two-point boundary value problem. However, these approaches are often sensitive to initial guesses and can be computationally challenging, especially when dealing with complex constraints. In contrast, direct methods, which discretise the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation, could offer robust, adaptable solutions for real-time decision-making. Despite their potential, the widespread adoption of these techniques has been limited, which may be due to restricted access to specialised software, perceived high costs, or unfamiliarity with these methods. This study investigates the feasibility, robustness, and potential of direct optimal control methods using nonlinear programming solvers on compartmental models described by ordinary differential equations to determine the best application of various interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination strategies. Through case studies, we demonstrate the use of NLP solvers to determine the optimal application of interventions based on single objectives, such as minimising total infections, "flattening the curve", or reducing peak infection levels, as well as multi-objective optimisation to achieve the best combination of interventions. While indirect methods provide useful theoretical insights, direct approaches may be a better fit for the fast-evolving challenges of real-world epidemiology.</description>

      <title>The origins of large-scale structure in family networks</title>

Abstract: Family relations are the most fundamental of all social networks and encompass everyone. Family networks grow as individuals have children, creating connections between families, which over time create large and complex structures. While partner-choice homophily has been proposed as a key driver in this growth process, little is known about the connection between individual behavior and the emergent large-scale structure of family networks. Here, we analyze a unique population-complete family network, covering millions of individuals across several decades, enriched with demographic, educational, and geographic data from high-quality national registries. Drawing on the longitudinal coverage of our observations and using a series of growing-network models, we unravel how individual-level behavior shapes the large-scale network structure. Contrary to prevailing theories, we find that partner-choice homophily has little effect on the emergent large-scale structure. Instead, we identify two key drivers: First, partner-change behavior, where individuals leave one partner for another, creates `shortcuts' in the network akin to rewirings in the Watts-Strogatz model. These shortcuts decrease pathlengths and accelerate the emergence of meso-scale connected components. Second, we find that partner change is a self-exciting behavior, such that the probability of changing partner increases with an individual's prior number of partners. The self-exciting behavior accelerates the generation of large network components, with highly connected individuals functioning as network hubs. Accounting for this partner-change behavior, we are able to accurately capture multiple large-scale network properties of the empirical family network. Finally we show that homophily-driven behavior is not able to generate the observed network structure.</description>
