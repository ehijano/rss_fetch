      <title>Approximating Maximum Edge 2-Coloring by Normalizing Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a simple, undirected graph G, an edge 2-coloring is a coloring of the edges such that no vertex is incident to edges with more than 2 distinct colors. The problem maximum edge 2-coloring (ME2C) is to find an edge 2-coloring in a graph G with the goal to maximize the number of colors. For a relevant graph class, ME2C models anti-Ramsey numbers and it was considered in network applications. For the problem a 2-approximation algorithm is known, and if the input graph has a perfect matching, the same algorithm has been shown to have a performance guarantee of 5/3. It is known that ME2C is APX-hard and that it is UG-hard to obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.5. We show that if the input graph has a perfect matching, there is a polynomial time 1.625-approximation and if the graph is claw-free or if the maximum degree of the input graph is at most three (i.e., the graph is subcubic), there is a polynomial time 1.5-approximation algorithm for ME2C</description>

      <title>Characterizing Flow Complexity in Transportation Networks using Graph Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Series-parallel network topologies generally exhibit simplified dynamical behavior and avoid high combinatorial complexity. A comprehensive analysis of how flow complexity emerges with a graph's deviation from series-parallel topology is therefore of fundamental interest. We introduce the notion of a robust $k$-path on a directed acycylic graph, with increasing values of the length $k$ reflecting increasing deviations. We propose a graph homology with robust $k$-paths as the bases of its chain spaces. In this framework, the topological simplicity of series-parallel graphs translates into a triviality of higher-order chain spaces. We discuss a correspondence between the space of order-three chains and sites within the network that are susceptible to the Braess paradox, a well-known phenomenon in transportation networks. In this manner, we illustrate the utility of the proposed graph homology in sytematically studying the complexity of flow networks.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity, Path Cover, and Independence Number: An FPT Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between Hamiltonicity and the independence numbers of graphs has been a fundamental aspect of Graph Theory since the seminal works of the 1960s. This paper presents a novel algorithmic perspective on these classical problems. Our contributions are twofold.
  First, we establish that a wide array of problems in undirected graphs, encompassing problems such as Hamiltonian Path and Cycle, Path Cover, Largest Linkage, and Topological Minor Containment are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the independence number of a graph. To the best of our knowledge, these results mark the first instances of FPT problems for such parameterization.
  Second, we extend the algorithmic scope of the Gallai-Milgram theorem. The original theorem by Gallai and Milgram, asserts that for a graph G with the independence number \alpha(G), the vertex set of G can be covered by at most \alpha(G) vertex-disjoint paths. We show that determining whether a graph can be covered by fewer than \alpha(G) - k vertex-disjoint paths is FPT parameterized by k.
  Notably, the independence number parameterization, which describes graph's density, departs from the typical flow of research in parameterized complexity, which focuses on parameters describing graph's sparsity, like treewidth or vertex cover.</description>

      <title>Tight bound for the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of tree minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree on $t$ vertices. We prove that for every positive integer $k$ and every graph $G$, either $G$ contains $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs each having a $T$ minor, or there exists a set $X$ of at most $t(k-1)$ vertices of $G$ such that $G-X$ has no $T$ minor. The bound on the size of $X$ is best possible and improves on an earlier $f(t)k$ bound proved by Fiorini, Joret, and Wood (2013) with some very fast growing function $f(t)$. Moreover, our proof is very short and simple.</description>

      <title>A Lower bound for Secure Domination Number of an Outerplanar Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a secure dominating set of $G$ if $S$ is a dominating set of $G$ and, for each vertex $u \not\in S$, there is a vertex $v \in S$ such that $uv$ is an edge and $(S \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ is also a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{s}(G)$, is the cardinality of a smallest secure dominating sets of $G$. In this paper, we prove that for any outerplanar graph with $n \geq 4$ vertices, $\gamma_{s}(G) \geq (n+4)/5$ and the bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Arborescences and Shortest Path Trees when Colors Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color-constrained subgraph problems are those where we are given an edge-colored (directed or undirected) graph and the task is to find a specific type of subgraph, like a spanning tree, an arborescence, a single-source shortest path tree, a perfect matching etc., with constraints on the number of edges of each color. Some of these problems, like color-constrained spanning tree, have elegant solutions and some of them, like color-constrained perfect matching, are longstanding open questions. In this work, we study color-constrained arborescences and shortest path trees. Computing a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs turns out to be NP-hard in general but polynomial-time solvable when all cycles have positive weight. This polynomial-time solvability is due to the fact that the solution space is essentially the set of all color-constrained arborescences of a directed acyclic subgraph of the original graph. While finding color-constrained arborescence of digraphs is NP-hard in general, we give efficient algorithms when the input graph is acyclic. Consequently, a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs having only positive weight cycles can be efficiently computed. Our algorithms also generalize to the problem of finding a color-constrained shortest path tree with minimum total weight. En route, we sight nice connections to colored matroids and color-constrained bases.</description>

      <title>Untangling Gaussian Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tangles were originally introduced as a concept to formalize regions of high connectivity in graphs. In recent years, they have also been discovered as a link between structural graph theory and data science: when interpreting similarity in data sets as connectivity between points, finding clusters in the data essentially amounts to finding tangles in the underlying graphs. This paper further explores the potential of tangles in data sets as a means for a formal study of clusters. Real-world data often follow a normal distribution. Accounting for this, we develop a quantitative theory of tangles in data sets drawn from Gaussian mixtures. To this end, we equip the data with a graph structure that models similarity between the points and allows us to apply tangle theory to the data. We provide explicit conditions under which tangles associated with the marginal Gaussian distributions exist asymptotically almost surely. This can be considered as a sufficient formal criterion for the separabability of clusters in the data.</description>

      <title>Non-convex relaxation and 1/2-approximation algorithm for the chance-constrained binary knapsack problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the chance-constrained binary knapsack problem (CKP), where the item weights are independent and normally distributed. We introduce a continuous relaxation for the CKP, represented as a non-convex optimization problem, which we call the non-convex relaxation. A comparative study shows that the non-convex relaxation provides an upper bound for the CKP, at least as tight as those obtained from other continuous relaxations for the CKP. Furthermore, the quality of the obtained upper bound is guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal objective value of the CKP. Despite its non-convex nature, we show that the non-convex relaxation can be solved in polynomial time. Subsequently, we proposed a polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for the CKP based on this relaxation, providing a lower bound for the CKP. Computational test results demonstrate that the non-convex relaxation and the proposed approximation algorithm yields tight lower and upper bounds for the CKP within a short computation time, ensuring the quality of the obtained bounds.</description>

      <title>Conflict-Free Coloring: Graphs of Bounded Clique Width and Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conflict-free coloring of a graph $G$ is a (partial) coloring of its vertices such that every vertex $u$ has a neighbor whose assigned color is unique in the neighborhood of $u$. There are two variants of this coloring, one defined using the open neighborhood and one using the closed neighborhood. For both variants, we study the problem of deciding whether the conflict-free coloring of a given graph $G$ is at most a given number $k$.
  In this work, we investigate the relation of clique-width and minimum number of colors needed (for both variants) and show that these parameters do not bound one another. Moreover, we consider specific graph classes, particularly graphs of bounded clique-width and types of intersection graphs, such as distance hereditary graphs, interval graphs and unit square and disk graphs. We also consider Kneser graphs and split graphs. We give (often tight) upper and lower bounds and determine the complexity of the decision problem on these graph classes, which improve some of the results from the literature. Particularly, we settle the number of colors needed for an interval graph to be conflict-free colored under the open neighborhood model, which was posed as an open problem.</description>

      <title>Reduction for asynchronous Boolean networks: elimination of negatively autoregulated components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simplify the analysis of Boolean networks, a reduction in the number of components is often considered. A popular reduction method consists in eliminating components that are not autoregulated, using variable substitution. In this work, we show how this method can be extended, for asynchronous dynamics of Boolean networks, to the elimination of vertices that have a negative autoregulation, and study the effects on the dynamics and interaction structure. For elimination of non-autoregulated variables, the preservation of attractors is in general guaranteed only for fixed points. Here we give sufficient conditions for the preservation of complex attractors. The removal of so called mediator nodes (i.e. vertices with indegree and outdegree one) is often considered, and frequently does not affect the attractor landscape. We clarify that this is not always the case, and in some situations even subtle changes in the interaction structure can lead to a different asymptotic behaviour. Finally, we use properties of the more general elimination method introduced here to give an alternative proof for a bound on the number of attractors of asynchronous Boolean networks in terms of the cardinality of positive feedback vertex sets of the interaction graph.</description>

      <title>The Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension of Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) dimension of a graph parameter $f$ is the minimum $k$ such that, if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are indistinguishable by the $k$-dimensional WL-algorithm then $f(G_1)=f(G_2)$. The WL-dimension of $f$ is $\infty$ if no such $k$ exists. We study the WL-dimension of graph parameters characterised by the number of answers from a fixed conjunctive query to the graph. Given a conjunctive query $\varphi$, we quantify the WL-dimension of the function that maps every graph $G$ to the number of answers of $\varphi$ in $G$.
  The works of Dvor\'ak (J. Graph Theory 2010), Dell, Grohe, and Rattan (ICALP 2018), and Neuen (ArXiv 2023) have answered this question for full conjunctive queries, which are conjunctive queries without existentially quantified variables. For such queries $\varphi$, the WL-dimension is equal to the treewidth of the Gaifman graph of $\varphi$.
  In this work, we give a characterisation that applies to all conjunctive qureies. Given any conjunctive query $\varphi$, we prove that its WL-dimension is equal to the semantic extension width $\mathsf{sew}(\varphi)$, a novel width measure that can be thought of as a combination of the treewidth of $\varphi$ and its quantified star size, an invariant introduced by Durand and Mengel (ICDT 2013) describing how the existentially quantified variables of $\varphi$ are connected with the free variables. Using the recently established equivalence between the WL-algorithm and higher-order Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) due to Morris et al. (AAAI 2019), we obtain as a consequence that the function counting answers to a conjunctive query $\varphi$ cannot be computed by GNNs of order smaller than $\mathsf{sew}(\varphi)$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey expansions of metrically homogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.02612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Ramsey expansions, the coherent extension property for partial isometries (EPPA), and the existence of a stationary independence relation for all classes of metrically homogeneous graphs from Cherlin's catalogue. We show that, with the exception of tree-like graphs, all metric spaces in the catalogue have precompact Ramsey expansions (or lifts) with the expansion property. With two exceptions we can also characterise the existence of a stationary independence relation and coherent EPPA.
  Our results are a contribution to Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes and can be seen as empirical evidence of the recent convergence in techniques employed to establish the Ramsey property, the expansion property, EPPA and the existence of a stationary independence relation. At the heart of our proof is a canonical way of completing edge-labelled graphs to metric spaces in Cherlin's classes. The existence of such a ``completion algorithm'' then allows us to apply several strong results in the areas that imply EPPA or the Ramsey property.
  The main results have numerous consequences for the automorphism groups of the Fraisse limits of the classes. As corollaries, we prove amenability, unique ergodicity, existence of universal minimal flows, ample generics, small index property, 21-Bergman property and Serre's property (FA).</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Approximating All $\ell_p$-norms in Correlation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers correlation clustering on unweighted complete graphs. We give a combinatorial algorithm that returns a single clustering solution that is simultaneously $O(1)$-approximate for all $\ell_p$-norms of the disagreement vector; in other words, a combinatorial $O(1)$-approximation of the all-norms objective for correlation clustering. This is the first proof that minimal sacrifice is needed in order to optimize different norms of the disagreement vector. In addition, our algorithm is the first combinatorial approximation algorithm for the $\ell_2$-norm objective, and more generally the first combinatorial algorithm for the $\ell_p$-norm objective when $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. It is also faster than all previous algorithms that minimize the $\ell_p$-norm of the disagreement vector, with run-time $O(n^\omega)$, where $O(n^\omega)$ is the time for matrix multiplication on $n \times n$ matrices. When the maximum positive degree in the graph is at most $\Delta$, this can be improved to a run-time of $O(n\Delta^2 \log n)$.</description>

      <title>On The Maximum Linear Arrangement Problem for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04487v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear arrangements of graphs are a well-known type of graph labeling and are found in many important computational problems, such as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem ($\texttt{minLA}$). A linear arrangement is usually defined as a permutation of the $n$ vertices of a graph. An intuitive geometric setting is that of vertices lying on consecutive integer positions in the real line, starting at 1; edges are often drawn as semicircles above the real line. In this paper we study the Maximum Linear Arrangement problem ($\texttt{MaxLA}$), the maximization variant of $\texttt{minLA}$. We devise a new characterization of maximum arrangements of general graphs, and prove that $\texttt{MaxLA}$ can be solved for cycle graphs in constant time, and for $k$-linear trees ($k\le2$) in time $O(n)$. We present two constrained variants of $\texttt{MaxLA}$ we call $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ and $\texttt{1-thistle MaxLA}$. We prove that the former can be solved in time $O(n)$ for any bipartite graph; the latter, by an algorithm that typically runs in time $O(n^4)$ on unlabelled trees. The combination of the two variants has two promising characteristics. First, it solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for almost all trees consisting of a few tenths of nodes. Second, we prove that it constitutes a $3/2$-approximation algorithm for $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for trees. Furthermore, we conjecture that $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for at least $50\%$ of all free trees.</description>
