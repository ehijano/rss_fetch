      <title>Whole-Song Hierarchical Generation of Symbolic Music Using Cascaded Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deep music generation studies have put much emphasis on long-term generation with structures. However, we are yet to see high-quality, well-structured whole-song generation. In this paper, we make the first attempt to model a full music piece under the realization of compositional hierarchy. With a focus on symbolic representations of pop songs, we define a hierarchical language, in which each level of hierarchy focuses on the semantics and context dependency at a certain music scope. The high-level languages reveal whole-song form, phrase, and cadence, whereas the low-level languages focus on notes, chords, and their local patterns. A cascaded diffusion model is trained to model the hierarchical language, where each level is conditioned on its upper levels. Experiments and analysis show that our model is capable of generating full-piece music with recognizable global verse-chorus structure and cadences, and the music quality is higher than the baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed model is controllable in a flexible way. By sampling from the interpretable hierarchical languages or adjusting pre-trained external representations, users can control the music flow via various features such as phrase harmonic structures, rhythmic patterns, and accompaniment texture.</description>

      <title>Building a Luganda Text-to-Speech Model From Crowdsourced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) development for African languages such as Luganda is still limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, single-speaker recordings essential for training TTS models. Prior work has focused on utilizing the Luganda Common Voice recordings of multiple speakers aged between 20-49. Although the generated speech is intelligible, it is still of lower quality than the model trained on studio-grade recordings. This is due to the insufficient data preprocessing methods applied to improve the quality of the Common Voice recordings. Furthermore, speech convergence is more difficult to achieve due to varying intonations, as well as background noise. In this paper, we show that the quality of Luganda TTS from Common Voice can improve by training on multiple speakers of close intonation in addition to further preprocessing of the training data. Specifically, we selected six female speakers with close intonation determined by subjectively listening and comparing their voice recordings. In addition to trimming out silent portions from the beginning and end of the recordings, we applied a pre-trained speech enhancement model to reduce background noise and enhance audio quality. We also utilized a pre-trained, non-intrusive, self-supervised Mean Opinion Score (MOS) estimation model to filter recordings with an estimated MOS over 3.5, indicating high perceived quality. Subjective MOS evaluations from nine native Luganda speakers demonstrate that our TTS model achieves a significantly better MOS of 3.55 compared to the reported 2.5 MOS of the existing model. Moreover, for a fair comparison, our model trained on six speakers outperforms models trained on a single-speaker (3.13 MOS) or two speakers (3.22 MOS). This showcases the effectiveness of compensating for the lack of data from one speaker with data from multiple speakers of close intonation to improve TTS quality.</description>

      <title>FunnelNet: An End-to-End Deep Learning Framework to Monitor Digital Heart Murmur in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Heart murmurs are abnormal sounds caused by turbulent blood flow within the heart. Several diagnostic methods are available to detect heart murmurs and their severity, such as cardiac auscultation, echocardiography, phonocardiogram (PCG), etc. However, these methods have limitations, including extensive training and experience among healthcare providers, cost and accessibility of echocardiography, as well as noise interference and PCG data processing. This study aims to develop a novel end-to-end real-time heart murmur detection approach using traditional and depthwise separable convolutional networks. Methods: Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied to extract meaningful features from the PCG data. The proposed network has three parts: the Squeeze net, the Bottleneck, and the Expansion net. The Squeeze net generates a compressed data representation, whereas the Bottleneck layer reduces computational complexity using a depthwise-separable convolutional network. The Expansion net is responsible for up-sampling the compressed data to a higher dimension, capturing tiny details of the representative data. Results: For evaluation, we used four publicly available datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance in all datasets. Furthermore, we tested our proposed network on two resource-constrained devices: a Raspberry PI and an Android device, stripping it down into a tiny machine learning model (TinyML), achieving a maximum of 99.70%. Conclusion: The proposed model offers a deep learning framework for real-time accurate heart murmur detection within limited resources. Significance: It will significantly result in more accessible and practical medical services and reduced diagnosis time to assist medical professionals. The code is publicly available at TBA.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hallucination in Text, Image, Video, and Audio Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs) across language, image, audio, and video domains has shown remarkable capabilities in diverse tasks. However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Text-to-Speech Synthesis from a Large Discrete Token-based Speech Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative language modeling applied to discrete speech tokens presented a new avenue for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. These speech language models (SLMs), similarly to their textual counterparts, are scalable, probabilistic, and context-aware. While they can produce diverse and natural outputs, they sometimes face issues such as unintelligibility and the inclusion of non-speech noises or hallucination. As the adoption of this innovative paradigm in speech synthesis increases, there is a clear need for an in-depth evaluation of its capabilities and limitations. In this paper, we evaluate TTS from a discrete token-based SLM, through both automatic metrics and listening tests. We examine five key dimensions: speaking style, intelligibility, speaker consistency, prosodic variation, spontaneous behaviour. Our results highlight the model's strength in generating varied prosody and spontaneous outputs. It is also rated higher in naturalness and context appropriateness in listening tests compared to a conventional TTS. However, the model's performance in intelligibility and speaker consistency lags behind traditional TTS. Additionally, we show that increasing the scale of SLMs offers a modest boost in robustness. Our findings aim to serve as a benchmark for future advancements in generative SLMs for speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>Semantic Gesticulator: Semantics-Aware Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present Semantic Gesticulator, a novel framework designed to synthesize realistic gestures accompanying speech with strong semantic correspondence. Semantically meaningful gestures are crucial for effective non-verbal communication, but such gestures often fall within the long tail of the distribution of natural human motion. The sparsity of these movements makes it challenging for deep learning-based systems, trained on moderately sized datasets, to capture the relationship between the movements and the corresponding speech semantics. To address this challenge, we develop a generative retrieval framework based on a large language model. This framework efficiently retrieves suitable semantic gesture candidates from a motion library in response to the input speech. To construct this motion library, we summarize a comprehensive list of commonly used semantic gestures based on findings in linguistics, and we collect a high-quality motion dataset encompassing both body and hand movements. We also design a novel GPT-based model with strong generalization capabilities to audio, capable of generating high-quality gestures that match the rhythm of speech. Furthermore, we propose a semantic alignment mechanism to efficiently align the retrieved semantic gestures with the GPT's output, ensuring the naturalness of the final animation. Our system demonstrates robustness in generating gestures that are rhythmically coherent and semantically explicit, as evidenced by a comprehensive collection of examples. User studies confirm the quality and human-likeness of our results, and show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art systems in terms of semantic appropriateness by a clear margin.</description>

      <title>Robust Singing Voice Transcription Serves Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Note-level Automatic Singing Voice Transcription (AST) converts singing recordings into note sequences, facilitating the automatic annotation of singing datasets for Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) applications. Current AST methods, however, struggle with accuracy and robustness when used for practical annotation. This paper presents ROSVOT, the first robust AST model that serves SVS, incorporating a multi-scale framework that effectively captures coarse-grained note information and ensures fine-grained frame-level segmentation, coupled with an attention-based pitch decoder for reliable pitch prediction. We also established a comprehensive annotation-and-training pipeline for SVS to test the model in real-world settings. Experimental findings reveal that ROSVOT achieves state-of-the-art transcription accuracy with either clean or noisy inputs. Moreover, when trained on enlarged, automatically annotated datasets, the SVS model outperforms its baseline, affirming the capability for practical application.

      <description>arXiv:2405.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes the Data-Efficient Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification Task in the DCASE 2024 Challenge and the corresponding baseline system. The task setup is a continuation of previous editions (2022 and 2023), which focused on recording device mismatches and low-complexity constraints. This year's edition introduces an additional real-world problem: participants must develop data-efficient systems for five scenarios, which progressively limit the available training data. The provided baseline system is based on an efficient, factorized CNN architecture constructed from inverted residual blocks and uses Freq-MixStyle to tackle the device mismatch problem. The baseline system's accuracy ranges from 42.40% on the smallest to 56.99% on the largest training set.</description>

      <title>Monaural speech enhancement on drone via Adapter based transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monaural Speech enhancement on drones is challenging because the ego-noise from the rotating motors and propellers leads to extremely low signal-to-noise ratios at onboard microphones. Although recent masking-based deep neural network methods excel in monaural speech enhancement, they struggle in the challenging drone noise scenario. Furthermore, existing drone noise datasets are limited, causing models to overfit. Considering the harmonic nature of drone noise, this paper proposes a frequency domain bottleneck adapter to enable transfer learning. Specifically, the adapter's parameters are trained on drone noise while retaining the parameters of the pre-trained Frequency Recurrent Convolutional Recurrent Network (FRCRN) fixed. Evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method can effectively enhance speech quality. Moreover, it is a more efficient alternative to fine-tuning models for various drone types, which typically requires substantial computational resources.</description>

      <title>Listen Again and Choose the Right Answer: A New Paradigm for Automatic Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have promoted generative error correction (GER) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), which aims to predict the ground-truth transcription from the decoded N-best hypotheses. Thanks to the strong language generation ability of LLMs and rich information in the N-best list, GER shows great effectiveness in enhancing ASR results. However, it still suffers from two limitations: 1) LLMs are unaware of the source speech during GER, which may lead to results that are grammatically correct but violate the source speech content, 2) N-best hypotheses usually only vary in a few tokens, making it redundant to send all of them for GER, which could confuse LLM about which tokens to focus on and thus lead to increased miscorrection. In this paper, we propose ClozeGER, a new paradigm for ASR generative error correction. First, we introduce a multimodal LLM (i.e., SpeechGPT) to receive source speech as extra input to improve the fidelity of correction output. Then, we reformat GER as a cloze test with logits calibration to remove the input information redundancy and simplify GER with clear instructions. Experiments show that ClozeGER achieves a new breakthrough over vanilla GER on 9 popular ASR datasets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Deep Audio-Text Retrieval Through the Lens of Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Learning-to-match (LTM) framework proves to be an effective inverse optimal transport approach for learning the underlying ground metric between two sources of data, facilitating subsequent matching. However, the conventional LTM framework faces scalability challenges, necessitating the use of the entire dataset each time the parameters of the ground metric are updated. In adapting LTM to the deep learning context, we introduce the mini-batch Learning-to-match (m-LTM) framework for audio-text retrieval problems. This framework leverages mini-batch subsampling and Mahalanobis-enhanced family of ground metrics. Moreover, to cope with misaligned training data in practice, we propose a variant using partial optimal transport to mitigate the harm of misaligned data pairs in training data. We conduct extensive experiments on audio-text matching problems using three datasets: AudioCaps, Clotho, and ESC-50. Results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of learning rich and expressive joint embedding space, which achieves SOTA performance. Beyond this, the proposed m-LTM framework is able to close the modality gap across audio and text embedding, which surpasses both triplet and contrastive loss in the zero-shot sound event detection task on the ESC-50 dataset. Notably, our strategy of employing partial optimal transport with m-LTM demonstrates greater noise tolerance than contrastive loss, especially under varying noise ratios in training data on the AudioCaps dataset.

      <title>Faces that Speak: Jointly Synthesising Talking Face and Speech from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to simultaneously generate natural talking faces and speech outputs from text. We achieve this by integrating Talking Face Generation (TFG) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems into a unified framework. We address the main challenges of each task: (1) generating a range of head poses representative of real-world scenarios, and (2) ensuring voice consistency despite variations in facial motion for the same identity. To tackle these issues, we introduce a motion sampler based on conditional flow matching, which is capable of high-quality motion code generation in an efficient way. Moreover, we introduce a novel conditioning method for the TTS system, which utilises motion-removed features from the TFG model to yield uniform speech outputs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively creates natural-looking talking faces and speech that accurately match the input text. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to build a multimodal synthesis system that can generalise to unseen identities.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Integration of Speech Separation and Voice Activity Detection for Low-Latency Diarization of Telephone Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works show that speech separation guided diarization (SSGD) is an increasingly promising direction, mainly thanks to the recent progress in speech separation. It performs diarization by first separating the speakers and then applying voice activity detection (VAD) on each separated stream. In this work we conduct an in-depth study of SSGD in the conversational telephone speech (CTS) domain, focusing mainly on low-latency streaming diarization applications. We consider three state-of-the-art speech separation (SSep) algorithms and study their performance both in online and offline scenarios, considering non-causal and causal implementations as well as continuous SSep (CSS) windowed inference. We compare different SSGD algorithms on two widely used CTS datasets: CALLHOME and Fisher Corpus (Part 1 and 2) and evaluate both separation and diarization performance. To improve performance, a novel, causal and computationally efficient leakage removal algorithm is proposed, which significantly decreases false alarms. We also explore, for the first time, fully end-to-end SSGD integration between SSep and VAD modules. Crucially, this enables fine-tuning on real-world data for which oracle speakers sources are not available. In particular, our best model achieves 8.8% DER on CALLHOME, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art end-to-end neural diarization model, despite being trained on an order of magnitude less data and having significantly lower latency, i.e., 0.1 vs. 1 seconds. Finally, we also show that the separated signals can be readily used also for automatic speech recognition, reaching performance close to using oracle sources in some configurations.</description>

      <title>Advancing African-Accented Speech Recognition: Epistemic Uncertainty-Driven Data Selection for Generalizable ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accents play a pivotal role in shaping human communication, enhancing our ability to convey and comprehend messages with clarity and cultural nuance. While there has been significant progress in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), African-accented English ASR has been understudied due to a lack of training datasets, which are often expensive to create and demand colossal human labor. Combining several active learning paradigms and the core-set approach, we propose a new multi-rounds adaptation process that uses epistemic uncertainty to automate the annotation process, significantly reducing the associated costs and human labor. This novel method streamlines data annotation and strategically selects data samples that contribute most to model uncertainty, thereby enhancing training efficiency. We define a new metric called U-WER to track model adaptation to hard accents. We evaluate our approach across several domains, datasets, and high-performing speech models. Our results show that our approach leads to a 69.44\% WER improvement while requiring on average 45\% less data than established baselines. Our approach also improves out-of-distribution generalization for very low-resource accents, demonstrating its viability for building generalizable ASR models in the context of accented African ASR.

      <title>GenTranslate: Large Language Models are Generative Multilingual Speech and Machine Translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06894</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have stepped forward the development of multilingual speech and machine translation by its reduced representation errors and incorporated external knowledge. However, both translation tasks typically utilize beam search decoding and top-1 hypothesis selection for inference. These techniques struggle to fully exploit the rich information in the diverse N-best hypotheses, making them less optimal for translation tasks that require a single, high-quality output sequence. In this paper, we propose a new generative paradigm for translation tasks, namely "GenTranslate", which builds upon LLMs to generate better results from the diverse translation versions in N-best list. Leveraging the rich linguistic knowledge and strong reasoning abilities of LLMs, our new paradigm can integrate the rich information in N-best candidates to generate a higher-quality translation result. Furthermore, to support LLM finetuning, we build and release a HypoTranslate dataset that contains over 592K hypotheses-translation pairs in 11 languages. Experiments on various speech and machine translation benchmarks (e.g., FLEURS, CoVoST-2, WMT) demonstrate that our GenTranslate significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model.</description>

      <title>BERP: A Blind Estimator of Room Acoustic and Physical Parameters for Single-Channel Noisy Speech Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Room acoustic parameters (RAPs) and room physical parameters ( RPPs) are essential metrics for parameterizing the room acoustical characteristics (RAC) of a sound field around a listener's local environment, offering comprehensive indications for various applications. The current RAPs and RPPs estimation methods either fall short of covering broad real-world acoustic environments in the context of real background noise or lack universal frameworks for blindly estimating RAPs and RPPs from noisy single-channel speech signals, particularly sound source distances, direction-of-arrival (DOA) of sound sources, and occupancy levels. On the other hand, in this paper, we propose a novel universal blind estimation framework called the blind estimator of room acoustical and physical parameters (BERP), by introducing a new stochastic room impulse response (RIR) model, namely, the sparse stochastic impulse response (SSIR) model, and endowing the BERP with a unified encoder and multiple separate predictors to estimate RPPs and SSIR parameters in parallel. This estimation framework enables the computationally efficient and universal estimation of room parameters by solely using noisy single-channel speech signals. Finally, all the RAPs can be simultaneously derived from the RIRs synthesized from SSIR model with the estimated parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed BERP and SSIR models, we compile a task-specific dataset from several publicly available datasets. The results reveal that the BERP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Moreover, the evaluation results pertaining to the SSIR RIR model also demonstrated its efficacy. The code is available on GitHub.</description>
