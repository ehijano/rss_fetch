      <title>On the validity of the Radon-Nikodym Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new general formulation of the Radon-Nikodym theorem in the setting of abstract measure theory. We introduce the notion of weak localizability for a measure and show that this property is both necessary and sufficient for the validity of a Radon-Nikodym-type representation under a natural compatibility relation between measures. The proof relies solely on elementary tools, such as Markov's inequality and the monotone convergence theorem. In addition to establishing the main result, we provide a constructive approach to envelope functions for families of non-negative measurable functions supported on sets of finite measure.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy atomic system and fuzzy K-frame in fuzzy Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic system in fuzzy Hilbert space is introduced and the existence of the fuzzy atomic systems for a strongly fuzzy bounded linear operator is studied. The notion of a K-frame in fuzzy Hilbert space is presented and some of their characterizations are given. We will see that fuzzy frame operator of a fuzzy K-frame in fuzzy Hilbert space is invertible under some sufficient condition and validates this by giving some examples. Fuzzy K-frame property in fuzzy Hilbert space preserve by a strongly fuzzy bounded linear operator is established. We will describe stability condition of fuzzy K-frame in fuzzy Hilbert space under some perturbations. We construct new types of fuzzy K-frame using fuzzy K-frame in fuzzy Hilbert space. Further, it is seen that scalar combinations and product of two fuzzy K-frames is also a fuzzy K-frame in fuzzy Hilbert space</description>

      <title>On a novel probabilistic Sampling Kantorovich operators and their application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article starts with the fundamental theory of stochastic type convergence and the significance of uniform integrability in the context of expectation value. A novel probabilistic sampling kantorovich (PSK-operators) is established with the help of classical sampling operators (SK-operators). We establish the proof of the fundamental theorem of approximation and a lemma corresponding to the PSK- operators. Moreover, some examples are illustrated not only in numerical form but also in a detailed study of some important features of an image at different samples. Eventually, a comparative analysis is made on the basis of some parameters like peak signal noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) etc. between the classical and probabilistic sense in tabulated form, which connects the whole dots of the theory present in the article.</description>

      <title>On the Density of Prime Imbalances in the Unit Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the set of normalized differences between primes, defined as $S = \{(p-q)/(p+q) : p &gt; q \text{ are primes}\}$, is dense in the open unit interval $(0,1)$. Our proof provides an explicit construction algorithm with quantitative bounds, relying on elementary results from prime number theory including Bertrand's postulate and explicit bounds on prime gaps in long intervals.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy location and allocation Hub Network Design for Air Cargo Transportation Considering Sustainability and Time Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hub location Problems seek to find hub facilities and assign non-hub nodes to them in such a way that the flow between origin and destination should be effectively established according to the desired goal. In general, in the literature of location, it is assumed that the time horizon of hub network design is a single time horizon. In the last two decades these problems have attracted special attention in the field of facility location problems and have wide applications in different fields including air cargo transportation. Cargo transportation is one of the most important economic sectors of any country. There are different ways to transport cargo, but air transport is preferred because it has high speed and security, so it is suitable for transporting goods related to technology, food, medicines, etc. In this article designing a hub network for air cargo transportation, taking into account hard and soft time windows along with considering the limited capacity for each hub under uncertainty is discussed. The proposed model is a developed model of an existing model in literature. Our Study has three linear functions: economic, environmental and social. In this article method of Fuzzy programming has been used to control the non-deterministic demand parameter. Results of model that has been solved by epsilon limitation method, NSGA-II, MOPSO and MOWOA algorithm show that as the uncertainty rate increases, the total costs of the system as well as the amount of environmental pollution increases. The reviews indicate the high performance of the NSGA-II algorithm in solving the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Segre Characteristic Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given only the dimension, $n$, of a square matrix $A \in M(n,\mathbb{C})$, how many Segre Characteristic equivalent matrices are there? Jordan Normal Form Theorem states that any linear operator over $\mathbb{C}$ is similar to a matrix in Jordan Normal Form. As such, this is a question of counting the number of possible Jordan Normal Forms for a given dimension. So, equivalently, how many Jordan Normal Forms can an $n\times n$ matrix possibly have?</description>

      <title>The Proof of the Collatz Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3n+1, or Collatz problem, is one of the hardest math problems, yet still unsolved. The Collatz conjecture is to prove or disprove that the Collatz sequences COL(n) always eventually reach the number of 1, for all n belongs to N+ (all positive integers). The Syracuse conjecture is a (2N+1)-version of Collatz conjecture, where (2N+1) is all odd integers. The Syracuse and Collatz problem can be conceptually described by a tree trunk and branches. The trunk is made of the junctions that produce the main branches, where J0=1 is the root junction. Each branch consists of active and dead junctions, where only the active junctions are capable of producing new sub-branches. Conceptually assuming the trunk and branches can grow indefinitely and can also absorb nutrients from the root. As the tree grows indefinitely, all N+ (2N+1) are included for the Collatz (Syracuse) sequence. This paper develops both inverse Collatz (Syracuse) functions to construct the tree trunk and branches starting from the root junction J0=1 and assign the also positive (odd) integers to all junctions. To verify the Collatz (Syracuse) sequences always eventually reach the number of 1, this paper also develops the PathFinding algorithm. Given n belongs to N+ (2N+1), the algorithm finds a path from n to the root junction J0=1 by the virtual tree structure to prove both Syracuse and Collatz conjectures.</description>
