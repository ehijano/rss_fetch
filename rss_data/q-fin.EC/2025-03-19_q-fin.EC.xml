      <title>Are Elites Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking? Evidence from MBA Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elites disproportionately influence policymaking, yet little is known about their fairness and efficiency preferences -- key determinants of support for redistributive policies. We investigate these preferences using an incentivized lab experiment with a group of future elites -- Ivy League MBA students. We find that elites implement more unequal earnings distributions than the average American, are highly sensitive to both merit-based inequality and efficiency costs of redistribution, and are less likely to hold strict meritocratic views. These findings provide novel insights into how elites' redistributive preferences may shape high levels of inequality and limited redistributive policy in the United States.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Impact of Environmental Liability Insurance on Industrial Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to explore whether environmental liability insurance has an important impact on industrial emission reduction, this paper selects provincial (city) level panel data from 2010 to 2020 and constructs a two-way fixed effect model to analyze the impact of environmental liability insurance on carbon emissions from both direct and indirect levels. The empirical analysis results show that: at the direct level, the development of environmental liability insurance has the effect of reducing industrial carbon emissions, and its effect is heterogeneous. At the indirect level, the role of environmental liability insurance is weaker in areas with developed financial industry and underdeveloped financial industry. Further heterogeneity analysis shows that in the industrial developed areas, the effect of environmental liability insurance on carbon emissions is more obvious. Based on this, countermeasures and suggestions are put forward from the aspects of expanding the coverage of environmental liability insurance, innovating the development of environmental liability insurance and improving the level of industrialization.</description>

      <title>Bloated Disclosures: Can ChatGPT Help Investors Process Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can fundamentally change the way investors process information. We probe the economic usefulness of these tools in summarizing complex corporate disclosures using the stock market as a laboratory. The unconstrained summaries are remarkably shorter compared to the originals, whereas their information content is amplified. When a document has a positive (negative) sentiment, its summary becomes more positive (negative). Importantly, the summaries are more effective at explaining stock market reactions to the disclosed information. Motivated by these findings, we propose a measure of information ``bloat." We show that bloated disclosure is associated with adverse capital market consequences, such as lower price efficiency and higher information asymmetry. Finally, we show that the model is effective at constructing targeted summaries that identify firms' (non-)financial performance. Collectively, our results indicate that generative AI adds considerable value for investors with information processing constraints.</description>

      <title>From Transcripts to Insights: Uncovering Corporate Risks Using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the value of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, in helping investors uncover dimensions of corporate risk. We develop and validate firm-level measures of risk exposure to political, climate, and AI-related risks. Using the GPT 3.5 model to generate risk summaries and assessments from the context provided by earnings call transcripts, we show that GPT-based measures possess significant information content and outperform the existing risk measures in predicting (abnormal) firm-level volatility and firms' choices such as investment and innovation. Importantly, information in risk assessments dominates that in risk summaries, establishing the value of general AI knowledge. We also find that generative AI is effective at detecting emerging risks, such as AI risk, which has soared in recent quarters. Our measures perform well both within and outside the GPT's training window and are priced in equity markets. Taken together, an AI-based approach to risk measurement provides useful insights to users of corporate disclosures at a low cost.</description>

      <title>Complex economics of simple periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08678v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the financial economics of simple periodic systems. Well-established financial procedures appear to be complicated, and lead to partially biased results. Probability theory is applied, and the focus is on the finances of simple periodic growth processes, in the absence of intermediate divestments. The expected value of the profit rate, derived from accounting measures on an accrual basis, does not depend on the capitalization path. The expected value of capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent capitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the time-average return rate on capital differs from the expected value of the return rate on capital for the growth cycle. The internal rate of return, defined through a compounding equation, is path-independent, thereby differing from the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that within a production estate, the area-average of internal rate of return is not representative of the rate of return on capital. The growth cycle length maximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate. Leverage effect enters the microeconomics of the growth processes through a separate leverage equation, where the leverage coefficient may reach positive or negative values. The leverage effect on the internal rate of return and the net present value are discussed. Both effects are solvable, resulting in incorrect estimates.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion And The Minimum Price Markov Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Minimum Price Markov Game (MPMG), a theoretical model that reasonably approximates real-world first-price markets following the minimum price rule, such as public auctions. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a framework to study market fairness and regulation in both digitized and non-digitized public procurement processes, amid growing concerns about algorithmic collusion in online markets. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning-driven artificial agents, we demonstrate that (i) the MPMG is a reliable model for first-price market dynamics, (ii) the minimum price rule is generally resilient to non-engineered tacit coordination among rational actors, and (iii) when tacit coordination occurs, it relies heavily on self-reinforcing trends. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about algorithmic pricing and its implications.</description>
