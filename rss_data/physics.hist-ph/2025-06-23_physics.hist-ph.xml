      <title>Principio de Contrastibilidad, Geometr\'ia y Sistemas de Conocimiento</title>

Abstract: There is a contemporary trend toward geometrizing all mathematical theories, as proposed by the Langlands program, and, by extension, physical theories as well. Within this paradigm, it becomes possible to represent physical objects as formal geometric entities. This opens the door within the framework of logical empiricism pragmatism and constructive realism to the development of a new philosophical approach grounded in a logical mathematical perspective. The aim is to integrate both the physics and metaphysics of the objects of the world into a unified system of knowledge, based on the geometric and physical interpretations of their mathematical representations. This article is presented as a foundational step in the development of that approach.</description>

      <title>Shadow in the Galactic Center: Theoretical Concept -- Prediction -- Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) was created in November 1915 and since its creation and up to now this theory has undergone many tests. The first realistic cosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the 1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in Soviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and evolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable. Due to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing interest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a development of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian researchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical cosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to outline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We discuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of relativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of black hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities for supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*.</description>

      <title>Microstates : Do the outliers worth</title>

Abstract: This note addresses the relevance of rare events in system dynamics, inspired by Jill North reflections on the origin of the arrow of time in thermodynamics. After identifying the existence of rare events, characterized by a Pareto distribution, within a simple gas particle simulation, we investigate their impact on entropy evolution. These rare events are associated with microstates that locally decrease entropy, in contrast to the overall entropy increase observed in the bulk of the system. We present numerical simulations of gas particles, both without and with a gravity-like attractive force, to explore the fate of these rare events. Our results show that, while rare events can transiently generate local decreases in entropy, global entropy may continue to increase in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. The introduction of gravity-like attraction stabilizes these low-entropy configurations, allowing them to persist longer. This study highlights the interplay between rare statistical fluctuations and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior, providing new insights into the emergence and stability of order in complex systems.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Formalism Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle in the real line I compile and contrast, starting with a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many amazing similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences. The basic reason for all of them is the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. It was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of his success at understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme which is consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify quantifications of them by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Fully Self-Consistent Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of quantum gravity consists of a gravitational framework which, unlike general relativity, takes into account the quantum character of matter. In spite of impressive advances, no fully satisfactory, self-consistent and empirically viable theory with those characteristics has ever been constructed. A successful semiclassical gravity model, in which the classical Einstein tensor couples to the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of quantum matter fields, would, at the very least, constitute a useful stepping stone towards quantum gravity. However, not only no empirically viable semiclassical theory has ever been proposed, but the self-consistency of semiclassical gravity itself has been called into question repeatedly over the years. Here, we put forward a fully self-consistent, empirically viable semiclassical gravity framework, in which the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a quantum field, evolving via a relativistic objective collapse dynamics, couples to a fully classical Einstein tensor. We present the general framework, a concrete example, and briefly explore possible empirical consequences of our model.</description>
