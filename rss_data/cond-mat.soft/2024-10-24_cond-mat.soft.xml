      <title>Dynamic Heterogeneity of Short Semi-crystalline Polymer Chains during Recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instant crystallization of semi-crystalline polymers have become possible following the recent advances in Fast Scanning Calorimetry (FSC) and enables to make a bridge between the time scale available experimentally with those accessible with computer simulations. Although the FSC observations have provided new information on the crystallization kinetics and evolution of the crystals, the molecular details on the chain exchange events between ordered and disordered domains of crystals have remained elusive. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the detailed chain dynamics and thermodynamics of polyamide 6 (PA6) system under two heating treatments. (i) Quenching PA6 melt deeply below the melting temperature T m and (ii) annealing the resulting quenched system to a temperature close to T m . We categorized the chains into mobile amorphous fraction (MAF) and rigid amorphous fraction (RAF), based on the length of consecutive chain's bond angles in trans state. In the deep quenched system close to the glass transition temperature T g , the mobility of the MAF chains are strongly suppressed and they remain in glassy state. However, upon rising the temperature close to melting temperature, the system undergoes recrystallization leading to coexistence of RAF and supercooled liquid MAF chains. The highly mobile unentangled MAF chains explore the interphase domains, and during the late-stage of crystallization, they are thermally translocated into the lamellae by reducing the fold number of RAF chains. The chain mobility in the annealed system could potentially lead to improved biodegradation in semi-crystalline chains.</description>

      <title>Pathological Rheology of Non-Stretching Entangled Polymers: Finite-Time Blow-Up Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-stretching approximation of polymer rheology simplifies a constitutive equation but fundamentally changes its behavior in fast flows, and the circumstances under which fast flows emerge cannot always be predicted a-priori. In this paper, we consider two simple flows for which shear rates are bounded in the original RP model but diverge to infinity in finite time for the non-stretching RP model. The disparity between the full and non-stretching models can be resolved by extending the non-stretching approximation to second order in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Phase Behaviour of X-Shaped Liquid Crystalline Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-shaped liquid crystalline molecules (XLCMs) are obtained by tethering two flexible end A-blocks and two flexible side B-blocks to a rigid backbone (R). A rich array of ordered structures can be formed from XLCMs, driven by the competition between the interactions between the chemically distinct blocks and the molecular connectivity. Here, we report a theoretical study on the phase behaviour of XLCMs with symmetric and asymmetric side blocks by using the self-consistent field theory (SCFT). A large number of ordered structures, including stable smectic-A, triangle-square, pentagon and giant polygon, are obtained as solutions of the SCFT equations. Phase diagrams of XLCMs as a function of the total length and asymmetric ratio of the side chains are constructed. For XLCMs with symmetric side blocks, the theoretically predicted phase transition sequence is in good agreement with experiments. For XLCMs with a fixed total side chain length, transitions between layered structure to polygonal phases, as well as between different polygonal phases, could be induced by varying the asymmetry of the side chains. The free energy density, domain size, side-chain stretching , and molecular orientation are analyzed to elucidate mechanisms stabilizing the different ordered phases.</description>

      <title>How combining integral equation closures with force density functional theory opens new perspectives in the study of inhomogeneous fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful framework to study inhomogeneous fluids. Its standard form is based on the knowledge of a generating free energy functional. If this is known exactly, then the results obtained by using standard DFT or its alternative, recently developed version, force-DFT, are the same. If the free energy functional is known only approximately then these two routes produce different outcomes. However, as we show in this work, force-DFT has the advantage that it is also implementable without knowledge of the free energy functional, by using instead liquid-state integral equation closures. This broadens the range of systems that can be explored, since free energy functionals are generally difficult to approximate. In this paper we explore the utility of using inhomogeneous integral equation closures within force-DFT thus demonstrating the versatility and accuracy of this new approach.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in liquid carbon tetrachloride: a molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a molecular dynamic study of collective excitations of carbon tetrachloride and compare the results with experimental data from the literature. The data of simulations are in good argeement with the experimental ones. The results of the simulations confirm the presence of large positive sound dispersion (PSD) in carbon tetrachloride, which should be related to some relaxation processes which do not take place in atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of microphase and bubbly phase-separated active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In phase-separated active fluids, the Ostwald process can go into reverse leading to either microphase separation or bubbly phase separation. We show that the latter is formed of two macroscopic regions that are occupied by the homogeneous fluid and by the microphase separated one. Within the microphase separated fluid, the relative rate of the Ostwald process, coalescence, and nucleation determines whether the size distribution of mesoscopic domains is narrowly peaked or displays a broad range of sizes before attaining a cutoff independent of system-size. Our results are obtained via large-scale simulations of a minimal field theory for active phase separation and reproduced by an effective model in which the degrees of freedom are the locations and sizes of the microphase-separated domains.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of impurities in a moderately dense confined granular gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transport of impurities immersed in a confined quasi-two-dimensional moderately dense granular gas of inelastic hard spheres is studied. The effect of the confinement on granular particles is modeled through a collisional model (the so-called $\Delta$-model) that includes an effective mechanism to transfer the kinetic energy injected by vibration in the vertical direction to the horizontal degrees of freedom of grains. The impurity can differ in mass, diameter, inelasticity, or the energy injection at collisions, compared to the gas particles. The Enskog--Lorentz kinetic equation for the impurities is solved via the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in spatial gradients for states close to the homogeneous steady state. As usual, the three diffusion transport coefficients for tracer particles in a mixture are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are solved by considering the lowest Sonine approximation. The theoretical predictions for the tracer diffusion coefficient (relating the mass flux with the gradient of the number density of tracer particles) are compared with both direct simulation Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. The agreement is in general good, except for strong inelasticity and/or large contrast of energy injection at tracer-gas collisions compared to gas-gas collisions. Finally, as an application of our results, the segregation problem induced by both a thermal gradient and gravity is exhaustively analyzed.</description>

      <title>Giant density fluctuations in locally hyperuniform states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems driven far from equilibrium may exhibit anomalous density fluctuations: active matter with orientational order display giant density fluctuations at large scale, while systems of interacting particles close to an absorbing phase transition may exhibit hyperuniformity, suppressing large-scale density fluctuations. We show that these seemingly incompatible phenomena can coexist in nematically ordered active systems, provided activity is conditioned to particle contacts. We characterize this unusual state of matter and unravel the underlying mechanisms simultaneously leading to spatially enhanced (on large length scales) and suppressed (on intermediate length scales) density fluctuations. Our work highlights the potential for a rich phenomenology in active matter systems in which particles' activity is triggered by their local environment, and calls for a more systematic exploration of absorbing phase transitions in orientationally-ordered particle systems.</description>

      <title>Sequence disorder-induced first order phase transition in confined polyelectrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a statistical mechanical model of a generic flexible polyelectrolyte, comprised of identically charged monomers with long range electrostatic interactions, and short-range interactions quantified by a disorder field along the polymer contour sequence, which is randomly quenched. The free energy and the monomer density profile of the system for no electrolyte screening are calculated in the case of a system composed of two infinite planar bounding surfaces with an intervening oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chain. We show that the effect of the contour sequence disorder, mediated by short-range interactions, leads to an enhanced localization of the polyelectrolyte chain and a first order phase transition at a critical value of the inter-surface spacing. This phase transition results in an abrupt change of the pressure from negative to positive values, effectively eliminating polyelectrolyte mediated bridging attraction.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via non-local visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>

      <title>Air jet impact craters on granular surfaces: a universal scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Craters form as the lander's exhaust interacts with the planetary surfaces. Understanding this phenomenon is imperative to ensure safe landings. We investigate crater morphology, where a turbulent air jet impinges on the granular surfaces. To reveal the fundamental aspect of this phenomenon, systematic experiments are performed with various air jet velocities, nozzle positions, and grain properties. The resultant crater morphology is characterized by an aspect ratio. We find a universal scaling law in which the aspect ratio is scaled by the dimensionless variable consisting of air velocity at the nozzle, speed of sound in air, nozzle diameter, nozzle tip distance from the surface, grain diameter, the density of grains, and density of air. The obtained scaling reveals the crossover of the length scales governing crater aspect ratio, providing a useful guideline for ensuring safe landings. Moreover, we report a novel drop shaped subsurface cratering phenomenon.</description>
