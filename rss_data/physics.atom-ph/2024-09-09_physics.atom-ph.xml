      <title>Proposal for a Bose-Einstein condensate based test of Born's rule using light-pulse atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and numerically benchmark light-pulse atom interferometry with ultra-cold quantum gases as a platform to test the modulo-square hypothesis of Born's rule. Our interferometric protocol is based on a combination of double Bragg and single Raman diffraction to induce multipath interference in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and block selected interferometer paths, respectively. In contrast to previous tests employing macroscopic material slits and blocking masks, optical diffraction lattices provide a high degree of control and avoid possible systematic errors like geometrical inaccuracies from manufacturing processes. In addition, sub-recoil expansion rates of delta-kick collimated BECs allow to prepare, distinguish and selectively address the external momentum states of the atoms. This further displays in close-to-unity diffraction fidelities favorable for both high-contrast interferometry and high extinction of the blocking masks. In return, non-linear phase shifts caused by repulsive atom-atom interactions need to be taken into account, which we fully reflect in our numerical simulations of the multipath interferometer. Assuming that the modulo-square rule holds, we examine the impact of experimental uncertainties in accordance with conventional BEC interferometer to provide an upper bound of $5.7\times10^{-3}$ $\left(1.8\times10^{-3}\right)$ on the statistical deviation of $100$ $\left(1000\right)$ iterations for a hypothetical third-order interference term.</description>

      <title>An optically accelerated extreme learning machine using hot atomic vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming a widely used technique with a impressive growth due to the diversity of problem of societal interest where it can offer practical solutions. This increase of applications and required resources start to become limited by present day hardware technologies. Indeed, novel machine learning subjects such as large language models or high resolution image recognition raise the question of large computing time and energy cost of the required computation. In this context, optical platforms have been designed for several years with the goal of developing more efficient hardware for machine learning. Among different explored platforms, optical free-space propagation offers various advantages: parallelism, low energy cost and computational speed. Here, we present a new design combining the strong and tunable nonlinear properties of a light beam propagating through a hot atomic vapor with an Extreme Learning Machine model. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the enhancement of the training using such free-space nonlinear propagation on a MNIST image classification task. We point out different experimental hyperparameters that can be further optimized to improve the accuracy of the platform.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Linearized Gravity in Atom Interferometers: a Simplified Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, fully-relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically-motivated scenarios: ($i$) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and ($ii$) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources ($e.g.$, a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Enhancement in Lossy Multi-Path Atom Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the sensitivity gains afforded by spin-squeezed states in atom interferometry, in particular using Bragg diffraction. We introduce a generalised input-output formalism that accurately describes realistic, non-unitary interferometers, including losses due to velocity selectivity and scattering into undesired momentum states. This formalism is applied to evaluate the performance of one-axis twisted spin-squeezed states in improving phase sensitivity. Our results show that by carefully optimising the parameters of the Bragg beam splitters and controlling the degree of squeezing, it is possible to improve the sensitivity of the interferometer by several dB with respect to the standard quantum limit despite realistic levels of losses in light pulse operations. However, the analysis also highlights the challenges associated with achieving these improvements in practice, most notably the impact of finite temperature on the benefits of entanglement. The results suggest ways of optimising interferometric setups to exploit quantum entanglement under realistic conditions, thereby contributing to advances in precision metrology with atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum dynamics as a scalable solution to the exoplanet opacity challenge: A case study of CO$_2$ in hydrogen atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, \citet{Niraula2022} pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this Letter, we introduce an end-to-end solution from ab initio calculations to pressure broadening, and use the perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ presents a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily driven by the observation of gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m and yet severely lack opacity data. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$ ~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements. Our proof-of-concept introduces a computationally affordable way to compute full-dimensional interaction potentials and scattering quantum dynamics with a precision sufficient to reduce the model-limited biases originating from the pressure broadening and thus support instrument-limited science with JWST and future missions.</description>

      <title>Adaptable platform for trapped cold electrons, hydrogen and lithium anions and cations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold cations, electrons and anions are ubiquitous in space, participate in star formation chemistry and are relevant to studies on the origin of molecular biology homochirality. We report on a system to generate and trap these species in the laboratory. Laser ablation of a solid target (LiH) facing a sublimating Ne matrix generates cold electrons, anions, and cations. Axial energy distributions (of e$^-$, H$^\pm$ and Li$^\pm$) peaked at 0-25 meV are obtained in a Penning trap at 90 mT and 0.5 eV barrier. Anions can be guided and neutralized with low recoil energy by near-threshold photodetachment. An immediate prospect for this H$^-$ source is to load hydrogen atoms into the ALPHA antihydrogen trap at CERN towards direct spectroscopic comparison of both conjugated species beyond 13 significant figures. The production is potentially scalable and adaptable to different species including deuterium and tritium, relevant for neutrino mass and fusion research.</description>

      <title>Cavity-resonated detection of spin polarization in a microfabricated atomic vapor cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate continuous Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) nondestructive monitoring of the electron spin polarization of an atomic vapor in a microfabricated vapor cell within an optical resonator. The two-chamber silicon and glass cell contains $^{87}$Rb and 1.3 amagat of N$_{2}$ buffer gas, and is placed within a planar optical resonator formed by two mirrors with dichroic dielectric coatings to resonantly enhance the coupling to phase-modulated probe light near the D$_2$ line at 780 nm. We describe the theory of signal generation in this system, including the spin-dependent complex refractive index, cavity optical transfer functions, and PDH signal response to spin polarization. We observe cavity transmission and PDH signals across $\approx 200$ GHz of detuning around the atomic resonance line. By resonant optical pumping on the 795 nm D$_1$ line, we observe spin-dependent cavity line shifts, in good agreement with theory. We use the saturation of the line shift vs. optical pumping power to calibrate the number density and efficiency of the optical pumping. In the unresolved sideband regime, we observe quantum-noise-limited PDH readout of the spin polarization density, with a flat noise floor of $9 \times 10^9$ spins cm$^{-3}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for frequencies above 700 Hz. We note possible extensions of the technique.</description>

      <title>Electronic processes in collisions between nitrogen ions and hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to interpret and predict the behavior and properties of fusion plasma, accurate cross sections for electronic processes in collisions between plasma impurities and atomic hydrogen are required. In this work, we investigate the electron capture (or charge exchange), target excitation, and ionization processes occurring in collision of ${\rm N}^{4+}$ with atomic hydrogen in a broad energy domain ranging from 0.06 to 225 keV/u. We consider ${\rm N}^{4+}$ ground state ${\rm N}^{4+} (2s)$ and also ${\rm N}^{4+} (2p)$ since the impurities in the edge plasma environment may be excited due to collisions with electrons and ions/atoms. Total and partial cross sections in both spin-averaged and spin-resolved cases are calculated using a two-active-electron semiclassical asymptotic-state close-coupling approach. For electron capture cross sections the present results show the best overall agreement with available experimental data for both total and partial cross sections, and the origins of observed discrepancies are discussed. Furthermore, we provide new data for target excitation and ionization processes, which are essential to improve our understanding of this relevant collision system.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>
