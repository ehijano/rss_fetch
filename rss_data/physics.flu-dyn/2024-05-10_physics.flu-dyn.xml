      <title>Localization and bistability of bioconvection in a doubly periodic domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A suspension of swimming microorganisms often generates a large-scale convective pattern known as bioconvection. In contrast to the thermal Rayleigh-Benard system, recent experimental studies report an emergence of steady localized convection patterns and bistability near the onset of instability in bioconvection systems. In this study, to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify the roles of particle self-propulsion in pattern formation, we theoretically and numerically investigate a model bioconvection system in a two-dimensional periodic boundary domain. In doing so, we extend a standard bioconvection model by introducing the equilibrium density profile as an independent parameter, for which the particle self-propulsion is treated as an independent dimensional parameter. Since the large-scale vertical structure dominates in this system, we are able to simplify the model by truncating the higher vertical modes. With this truncated model, we analytically derived the neutrally stable curve and found that the particle motility stabilizes the system. We then numerically analyzed the bifurcation diagram and found the bistable structure at the onset of instability. These findings, localization and bistability, are consistent with experimental observations. We further examined the global structure of the bistable dynamical system and found that the non-trivial unstable steady solution behaves as an edge state that separates the basins of attractors. These results highlight the importance of particle self-propulsion in bioconvection, and more generally our methodology based on the dynamical systems theory is useful in understanding complex flow patterns in nature.</description>

      <title>Instability of a dusty shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the instability of a dusty simple shear flow where the dust particles are distributed non-uniformly. A simple shear flow is modally stable to infinitesimal perturbations. Also, a band of particles remains unaffected in the absence of any background flow. However, we demonstrate that the combined scenario -- comprising a simple shear flow with a localised band of particles -- can exhibit destabilisation due to their two-way interaction. The instability originates solely from the momentum feedback from the particle phase to the fluid phase. Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations are employed to illustrate the existence of this instability. Furthermore, the results are compared with a linear stability analysis of the system using an Eulerian-Eulerian model. Our findings indicate that the instability has an inviscid origin and is characterised by a critical wavelength below which it is not persistent. We have observed that increasing particle inertia dampens the unstable modes, whereas the strength of the instability increases with the strength of the coupling between the fluid and particle phases.</description>

      <title>Mapping dissolved carbon in space and time: An experimental technique for the measurement of pH and total carbon concentration in density driven convection of CO$_2$ dissolved in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental technique for determining the pH and the total carbon concentration when \ch{CO2} diffuses and flows in water. The technique employs three different pH indicators, which, when combined with an image analysis technique, provides a dynamic range in pH from 4.0 to 9.5. In contrast to usual techniques in which a single pH indicator is used, the methodology presented allows not only to produce a binary classification (pH larger or smaller than a given threshold) but to access a much more complete continuous spatial distribution of pH and concentration levels in the system. We calibrate the method against benchmark solutions and further demonstrate its potential by measuring the pH and total carbon concentration in a density driven convection (DDC) of carbon-enriched water. The motivation for testing the method in this particular experiment comes from the fact that DDC plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of engineered carbon storage processes. The application of the technique presented here provided a direct window for the analysis of the spatial distribution of captured carbon in the DDC flow.</description>

      <title>Experience and Analysis of Scalable High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics on Modular Supercomputing Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The never-ending computational demand from simulations of turbulence makes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) a prime application use case for current and future exascale systems. High-order finite element methods, such as the spectral element method, have been gaining traction as they offer high performance on both multicore CPUs and modern GPU-based accelerators. In this work, we assess how high-fidelity CFD using the spectral element method can exploit the modular supercomputing architecture at scale through domain partitioning, where the computational domain is split between a Booster module powered by GPUs and a Cluster module with conventional CPU nodes. We investigate several different flow cases and computer systems based on the modular supercomputing architecture (MSA). We observe that for our simulations, the communication overhead and load balancing issues incurred by incorporating different computing architectures are seldom worthwhile, especially when I/O is also considered, but when the simulation at hand requires more than the combined global memory on the GPUs, utilizing additional CPUs to increase the available memory can be fruitful. We support our results with a simple performance model to assess when running across modules might be beneficial. As MSA is becoming more widespread and efforts to increase system utilization are growing more important our results give insight into when and how a monolithic application can utilize and spread out to more than one module and obtain a faster time to solution.</description>

      <title>PiRD: Physics-informed Residual Diffusion for Flow Field Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of machine learning in fluid dynamics is becoming more common to expedite the computation when solving forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations. Yet, a notable challenge with existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for data fidelity enhancement is their reliance on specific low-fidelity data patterns and distributions during the training phase. In addition, the CNN-based method essentially treats the flow reconstruction task as a computer vision task that prioritizes the element-wise precision which lacks a physical and mathematical explanation. This dependence can dramatically affect the models' effectiveness in real-world scenarios, especially when the low-fidelity input deviates from the training data or contains noise not accounted for during training. The introduction of diffusion models in this context shows promise for improving performance and generalizability. Unlike direct mapping from a specific low-fidelity to a high-fidelity distribution, diffusion models learn to transition from any low-fidelity distribution towards a high-fidelity one. Our proposed model - Physics-informed Residual Diffusion, demonstrates the capability to elevate the quality of data from both standard low-fidelity inputs, to low-fidelity inputs with injected Gaussian noise, and randomly collected samples. By integrating physics-based insights into the objective function, it further refines the accuracy and the fidelity of the inferred high-quality data. Experimental results have shown that our approach can effectively reconstruct high-quality outcomes for two-dimensional turbulent flows from a range of low-fidelity input conditions without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>Using Biot-Savart boundary conditions for unbounded external flow on Eulerian meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel boundary condition formulated using a Biot-Savart vorticity integral inside an Eulerian fluid domain that maintains high-accuracy results even when the domain boundary is within a body-length of immersed solid boundaries. The Biot-Savart condition is incorporated into a general solver with Eulerian velocity-pressure fields by including the pressure-induced body vorticity during the incompressible-flow projection-step. We use a multilevel approach to reduce the computational cost of the evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral from O(N) to O(\log N) and formally show that the error associated with this approach is bounded and scales with the inverse power of the problem's dimension. We use two-dimensional and three-dimensional analytic vortex problems to demonstrate this scaling is correct and select appropriate multilevel coarsening parameters accordingly. We show that the new method exactly captures the analytical added-mass force of accelerating plates and matches experimentally measured wake development even when the entire domain only extends 1/2 diameter from the plate. The new method also predicts essentially identical time-varying drag forces for a two-dimensional circle regardless of domain size, while classical boundary conditions require a domain nearly 48 times larger to converge on the new method's result. Finally, we study the sensitivity of 2D deflected wakes to the new domain boundary conditions and show that only in minimal domains, 25 times smaller than the reference domain, the omission of the far-field wake influences the flow field and the forces on the body. Doubling the domain size recovers the correct results.</description>

      <title>Momentum deficit and wake-added turbulence kinetic energy budgets in the stratified atmospheric boundary layer</title>

Abstract: To achieve decarbonization targets, wind turbines are growing in hub height, rotor diameter, and are being deployed in new locations with diverse atmospheric conditions not previously seen, such as offshore. Physics-based analytical wake models commonly used for design and control of wind farms simplify atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and wake physics to achieve computational efficiency. This is done primarily through a simplified model form that neglects certain flow processes and through parameterization of ABL and wake turbulence through a wake spreading rate. In this study, we analyze the physical mechanisms that govern momentum and turbulence within a wind turbine wake in the stratified ABL. We use large eddy simulation and analysis of the streamwise momentum deficit and wake-added turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budgets to study wind turbine wakes under neutral and stable conditions. To parse the wake from the turbulent, incident ABL flow, we decompose the flow into the base ABL flow and the deficit flow produced by the presence of a turbine. We analyze the decomposed flow field budgets to study the effects of changing stability on the streamwise momentum deficit and wake-added TKE. The results demonstrate that stability changes the importance of physical mechanisms for both quantities primarily through the nonlinear interactions of the base and deficit flows, with the stable case most affected by higher shear in the base flow and the neutral case by higher base flow TKE. Buoyancy forcing terms in the momentum deficit and wake-added TKE budgets are relatively less important compared to the aforementioned effects. While total TKE is higher in wakes in neutral ABL flows, the wake-added TKE is higher downwind of turbines in stable ABL conditions. The dependence of wake-added TKE on ABL stability is not represented in existing empirical models widely used for mean wake flow modeling.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en waves at low Magnetic Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper seeks whether Alfv\'en waves (AW) can be produced in laboratory-scale liquid metal experiments, \emph{i.e.} at low-magnetic Reynolds Number ($R\!m$). AW are incompressible waves propagating along magnetic fields typically found geo and astrophysical systems. Until now, only faint linear waves have been experimentally produced in liquid metals because of the large magnetic dissipation they undergo when $R\!m\ll1$. Yet, controlling laboratory AW could emulate such far remote processes as anomalous heating in the solar corona, oscillations of the Earth inner core or turbulence in the solar wind. To answer this question, we force AW with an AC electric current in a liquid metal channel in a transverse magnetic field. We derive a wave-bearing extension of the usual low$-R\!m$ MHD approximation to identify two linear regimes: The purely diffusive regime exists when $N_\omega$, the ratio of the oscillation period to the timescale of diffusive two-dimensionalisation by the Lorentz force, is small. The propagative regime is governed by the ratio of the forcing period to the AW propagation timescale which, we call the Jameson number $J\!a$ after Jameson (1964), JFM. In this regime, AW are dissipative and dispersive as they propagate more slowly where velocity gradients are higher. Both regimes are recovered in the FLOWCUBE experiment, in excellent agreement with the model up to $J\!a \lesssim 0.85$ but near the $J\!a=1$ resonance, high amplitude waves become clearly nonlinear. Hence, in electrically driving AW, we were able to produce some of the propagative, diffusive and nonlinear processes of astro and geophysical AW.</description>
