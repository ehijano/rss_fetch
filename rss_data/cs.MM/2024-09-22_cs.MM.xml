      <title>Across-Game Engagement Modelling via Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain generalisation involves learning artificial intelligence (AI) models that can maintain high performance across diverse domains within a specific task. In video games, for instance, such AI models can supposedly learn to detect player actions across different games. Despite recent advancements in AI, domain generalisation for modelling the users' experience remains largely unexplored. While video games present unique challenges and opportunities for the analysis of user experience -- due to their dynamic and rich contextual nature -- modelling such experiences is limited by generally small datasets. As a result, conventional modelling methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap between users and games due to their reliance on large labelled training data and assumptions of common distributions of user experience. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a framework that decomposes the general domain-agnostic modelling of user experience into several domain-specific and game-dependent tasks that can be solved via few-shot learning. We test our framework on a variation of the publicly available GameVibe corpus, designed specifically to test a model's ability to predict user engagement across different first-person shooter games. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of few-shot learners over traditional modelling methods and thus showcase the potential of few-shot learning for robust experience modelling in video games and beyond.</description>

      <title>DiffSSD: A Diffusion-Based Dataset For Speech Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech generators are ubiquitous. These methods can generate very high quality synthetic speech and several recent incidents report their malicious use. To counter such misuse, synthetic speech detectors have been developed. Many of these detectors are trained on datasets which do not include diffusion-based synthesizers. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing detectors trained on one such dataset, ASVspoof2019, do not perform well in detecting synthetic speech from recent diffusion-based synthesizers. We propose the Diffusion-Based Synthetic Speech Dataset (DiffSSD), a dataset consisting of about 200 hours of labeled speech, including synthetic speech generated by 8 diffusion-based open-source and 2 commercial generators. We also examine the performance of existing synthetic speech detectors on DiffSSD in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. The results highlight the importance of this dataset in detecting synthetic speech generated from recent open-source and commercial speech generators.</description>

      <title>ChemDFM-X: Towards Large Multimodal Model for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid developments of AI tools are expected to offer unprecedented assistance to the research of natural science including chemistry. However, neither existing unimodal task-specific specialist models nor emerging general large multimodal models (LMM) can cover the wide range of chemical data modality and task categories. To address the real demands of chemists, a cross-modal Chemical General Intelligence (CGI) system, which serves as a truly practical and useful research assistant utilizing the great potential of LMMs, is in great need. In this work, we introduce the first Cross-modal Dialogue Foundation Model for Chemistry (ChemDFM-X). Diverse multimodal data are generated from an initial modality by approximate calculations and task-specific model predictions. This strategy creates sufficient chemical training corpora, while significantly reducing excessive expense, resulting in an instruction-tuning dataset containing 7.6M data. After instruction finetuning, ChemDFM-X is evaluated on extensive experiments of different chemical tasks with various data modalities. The results demonstrate the capacity of ChemDFM-X for multimodal and inter-modal knowledge comprehension. ChemDFM-X marks a significant milestone toward aligning all modalities in chemistry, a step closer to CGI.</description>

      <title>Temporally Aligned Audio for Video with Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce V-AURA, the first autoregressive model to achieve high temporal alignment and relevance in video-to-audio generation. V-AURA uses a high-framerate visual feature extractor and a cross-modal audio-visual feature fusion strategy to capture fine-grained visual motion events and ensure precise temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose VisualSound, a benchmark dataset with high audio-visual relevance. VisualSound is based on VGGSound, a video dataset consisting of in-the-wild samples extracted from YouTube. During the curation, we remove samples where auditory events are not aligned with the visual ones. V-AURA outperforms current state-of-the-art models in temporal alignment and semantic relevance while maintaining comparable audio quality. Code, samples, VisualSound and models are available at https://v-aura.notion.site</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient SDRTV-to-HDRTV by Learning from Image Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern displays can render video content with high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG). However, most resources are still in standard dynamic range (SDR). Therefore, transforming existing SDR content into the HDRTV standard holds significant value. This paper defines and analyzes the SDRTV-to-HDRTV task by modeling the formation of SDRTV/HDRTV content. Our findings reveal that a naive endto-end supervised training approach suffers from severe gamut transition errors. To address this, we propose a new three-step solution called HDRTVNet++, which includes adaptive global color mapping, local enhancement, and highlight refinement. The adaptive global color mapping step utilizes global statistics for image-adaptive color adjustments. A local enhancement network further enhances details, and the two sub-networks are combined as a generator to achieve highlight consistency through GANbased joint training. Designed for ultra-high-definition TV content, our method is both effective and lightweight for processing 4K resolution images. We also constructed a dataset using HDR videos in the HDR10 standard, named HDRTV1K, containing 1235 training and 117 testing images, all in 4K resolution. Additionally, we employ five metrics to evaluate SDRTV-to-HDRTV performance. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and visually. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/xiaom233/HDRTVNet-plus.</description>

      <title>High Perceptual Quality Wireless Image Delivery with Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the image transmission problem over a noisy wireless channel via deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) along with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) at the receiver. Specifically, we are interested in the perception-distortion trade-off in the practical finite block length regime, in which separate source and channel coding can be highly suboptimal. We introduce a novel scheme, where the conventional DeepJSCC encoder targets transmitting a lower resolution version of the image, which later can be refined thanks to the generative model available at the receiver. In particular, we utilize the range-null space decomposition of the target image; DeepJSCC transmits the range-space of the image, while DDPM progressively refines its null space contents. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant improvements in distortion and perceptual quality of reconstructed images compared to standard DeepJSCC and the state-of-the-art generative learning-based method.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-label Recognition using Class Co-Occurrence Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves the identification of multiple objects within an image. To address the additional complexity of this problem, recent works have leveraged information from vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large text-images datasets for the task. These methods learn an independent classifier for each object (class), overlooking correlations in their occurrences. Such co-occurrences can be captured from the training data as conditional probabilities between a pair of classes. We propose a framework to extend the independent classifiers by incorporating the co-occurrence information for object pairs to improve the performance of independent classifiers. We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to enforce the conditional probabilities between classes, by refining the initial estimates derived from image and text sources obtained using VLMs. We validate our method on four MLR datasets, where our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.</description>
