      <title>DAWN: Designing Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed them from basic conversational tools into sophisticated entities capable of complex reasoning and decision-making. These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them towards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a versatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software systems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range of use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be easily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are coordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN offers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot for augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations. Additionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations globally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting the network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based applications across various industries.</description>

      <title>BBR Fairness Evaluation Using NS-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the fairness of BBR congestion control using NS-3 simulator. While BBR improves performance over loss-based methods in single flows, unfairness issues emerge with competing BBR and BBR/Cubic flows. Unfairness correlates with factors like round-trip time and buffer size. The core reason is the lack of responding mechanisms for the flows to converge on fair bandwidth share.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative Execution in Mission-Oriented Drone Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mission-oriented drone networks have been widely used for structural inspection, disaster monitoring, border surveillance, etc. Due to the limited battery capacity of drones, mission execution strategy impacts network performance and mission completion. However, collaborative execution is a challenging problem for drones in such a dynamic environment as it also involves efficient trajectory design. We leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to manage the challenge in this study, letting each drone learn to collaboratively execute tasks and plan trajectories based on its current status and environment. Simulation results show that the proposed collaborative execution model can successfully complete the mission at least 80% of the time, regardless of task locations and lengths, and can even achieve a 100% success rate when the task density is not way too sparse. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the pioneer studies on leveraging MARL on collaborative execution for mission-oriented drone networks; the unique value of this work lies in drone battery level driving our model design.</description>

      <title>Towards Constraint-aware Learning for Resource Allocation in NFV-enabled Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that refers to resource allocation associated with hard and multifaceted constraints in network function virtualization (NFV). Existing works for VNE struggle to handle such complex constraints, leading to compromised system performance and stability. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{CON}straint-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{L}earning framework for VNE, named \textbf{CONAL}, to achieve efficient constraint management. Concretely, we formulate the VNE problem as a constrained Markov decision process with violation tolerance. This modeling approach aims to improve both resource utilization and solution feasibility by precisely evaluating solution quality and the degree of constraint violation. We also propose a reachability-guided optimization with an adaptive reachability budget method that dynamically assigns budget values. This method achieves persistent zero violation to guarantee the feasibility of VNE solutions and more stable policy optimization by handling instances without any feasible solution. Furthermore, we propose a constraint-aware graph representation method to efficiently learn cross-graph relations and constrained path connectivity in VNE. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/GeminiLight/conal-vne.</description>

      <title>From Hype to Reality: The Road Ahead of Deploying DRL in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrial landscape is rapidly evolving with the advent of 6G applications, which demand massive connectivity, high computational capacity, and ultra-low latency. These requirements present new challenges, which can no longer be efficiently addressed by conventional strategies. In response, this article underscores the transformative potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for 6G, highlighting its advantages over classic machine learning solutions in meeting the demands of 6G. The necessity of DRL is further validated through three DRL applications in an end-to-end communication procedure, including wireless access control, baseband function placement, and network slicing coordination. However, DRL-based network management initiatives are far from mature. We extend the discussion to identify the challenges of applying DRL in practical networks and explore potential solutions along with their respective limitations. In the end, these insights are validated through a practical DRL deployment in managing network slices on the testbed.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Intra-Domain Network Slicing for Multi-Layer Orchestration in Intelligent-Driven Distributed 6G Networks: Learning Generic Assignment Skills with Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the 6th Generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to provide a new level of network services and meet the emerging expectations of the future, it will be a complex and intricate networking system. 6Gs sophistication and robustness will be accompanied by complexities, which will require novel strategies to tackle them. This research work focuses on decentralized and multi-level system models for 6G networks and proposes an energy efficient automation strategy for edge domain management and Network Slicing (NS) with the main objective of reducing the networks complexity by leveraging scalability, efficiency, and generalization. Accordingly, we propose a pre-train phase to discover useful assignment skills in network edge domains by utilizing unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (unsupervised RL). The suggested technique does not depend on the domain specifications and thus is applicable to all the edge domains. Our proposed approach not only enables scalability and decentralization, but it also delivers efficiency by assisting domain controllers to provide various service types. We implemented the pre-training phase, and monitored that the discovered assignment skills span the entire interval of possible resource assignment portions for every service type.</description>

      <title>Resilient-By-Design: A Resiliency Framework for Future Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our future society will be increasingly digitalised, hyper-connected and globally data driven. The sixth generation (6G) and beyond 6G wireless networks are expected to bridge the digital and physical worlds by providing wireless connectivity as a service to different vertical sectors, including industries, smart cities, eHealth and autonomous transportation. Such far reaching integration will render the society increasingly reliant on wireless networks. While this has the potential to greatly enhance our quality and ease of life, any disruption to these networks would also have significant impact with overreaching consequences. Disruptions can happen due to a variety of reasons, including planned outages, failures due to the nature of wireless propagation, natural disasters, and deliberate cybersecurity attacks. Hence, 6G and beyond 6G networks should not only provide near instant and virtually unlimited connectivity, but also be resilient against internal and external disruptions. This paper proposes a resilient-by-design framework towards this end. First, we provide an overview of the disruption landscape. Thereafter, we comprehensively outline the main features of the proposed concept. Finally, we detail the four key steps of the framework, namely predict, preempt, protect and progress. A simple but illustrative preliminary simulation result is also presented to highlight the potential advantages and efficiency of the proposed approach in addressing outages.</description>

      <title>V2X-Assisted Distributed Computing and Control Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles under Ramp Merging Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates distributed computing and cooperative control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in ramp merging scenario under transportation cyber-physical system. Firstly, a centralized cooperative trajectory planning problem is formulated subject to the safely constraints and traffic performance in ramp merging scenario, where the trajectories of all vehicles are jointly optimized. To get rid of the reliance on a central controller and reduce computation time, a distributed solution to this problem implemented among CAVs through Vehicles-to-Everything (V2X) communication is proposed. Unlike existing method, our method can distribute the computational task among CAVs and carry out parallel solving through V2X communication. Then, a multi-vehicles model predictive control (MPC) problem aimed at maximizing system stability and minimizing control input is formulated based on the solution of the first problem subject to strict safety constants and input limits. Due to these complex constraints, this problem becomes high-dimensional, centralized, and non-convex. To solve it in a short time, a decomposition and convex reformulation method, namely distributed cooperative iterative model predictive control (DCIMPC), is proposed. This method leverages the communication capability of CAVs to decompose the problem, making full use of the computational resources on vehicles to achieve fast solutions and distributed control. The two above problems with their corresponding solving methods form the systemic framework of the V2X assisted distributed computing and control. Simulations have been conducted to evaluate the framework's convergence, safety, and solving speed. Additionally, extra experiments are conducted to validate the performance of DCIMPC. The results show that our method can greatly improve computation speed without sacrificing system performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Routing on Quantum Networks using Adaptive Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce QuARC, Quantum Adaptive Routing using Clusters, a novel clustering-based entanglement routing protocol that leverages redundant, multi-path routing through multi-particle projective quantum measurements to enable high-throughput, low-overhead, starvation-free entanglement distribution. At its core, QuARC periodically reconfigures the underlying quantum network into clusters of different sizes, where each cluster acts as a small network that distributes entanglement across itself, and the end-to-end entanglement is established by further distributing between clusters. QuARC does not require a-priori knowledge of any physical parameters, and is able to adapt the network configuration using static topology information, and using local (within-cluster) measurements only. We present a comprehensive simulation-based evaluation that shows QuARC is robust against changes to physical network parameters, and maintains high throughput without starvation even as network sizes scale and physical parameters degrade.</description>

      <title>Attention-Enhanced Prioritized Proximal Policy Optimization for Adaptive Edge Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to better capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)--based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.</description>

      <title>AraSync: Precision Time Synchronization in Rural Wireless Living Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time synchronization is a critical component in network operation and management, and it is also required by Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) in next-generation wireless systems such as those of 5G, 6G, and Open RAN. In this context, we design and implement AraSync as an end-to-end time synchronization system in the ARA wireless living lab to enable advanced wireless experiments and applications involving stringent time constraints. We make use of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at different levels to achieve synchronization accuracy in the order of nanoseconds. Along with fiber networks, AraSync enables time synchronization across the AraHaul wireless x-haul network consisting of long-range, high-capacity mmWave and microwave links. In this paper, we present the detailed design and implementation of AraSync, including its hardware and software components and the PTP network topology. Further, we experimentally characterize the performance of AraSync from spatial and temporal dimensions. Our measurement and analysis of the clock offset and mean path delay show the impact of the wireless channel and weather conditions on the PTP synchronization accuracy.</description>
