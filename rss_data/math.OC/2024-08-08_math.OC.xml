      <title>A PINN approach for the online identification and control of unknown PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized solving differential equations by integrating physical laws into neural network training. This paper explores PINNs for open-loop optimal control problems (OCPs) with incomplete information, such as unknown initial conditions and sparse boundary data. We derive optimality conditions from the Lagrangian multipliers and use a neural network to predict the state, adjoint, and control variables. In contrast with previous methods, our approach integrates these elements into a single neural network and addresses scenarios with consistently limited data. Specifically, we address the study of partially unknown equations identifying underlying parameters online by searching for the optimal solution. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method even in scenarios characterized by a considerable lack of information.</description>

      <title>New global Carleman estimates and null controllability for a stochastic Cahn-Hilliard type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for a stochastic semilinear CahnHilliard type equation, whose semilinear term contains first and second order derivatives of solutions. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear backward stochastic fourth order parabolic equations with $L^2$-valued source terms is derived, which is based on a new fundamental identity for a stochastic fourth order parabolic operator. Based on it, we establish a new global Carleman estimate for linear backward stochastic fourth order parabolic equations with $H^{-2}$-valued source terms, which, together with a fixed point argument, derive the desired null controllability for the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard type equation.</description>

      <title>SLRQA: A Sparse Low-Rank Quaternion Model for Color Image Processing with Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Sparse Low-rank Quaternion Approximation (SLRQA) model for color image processing problems with noisy observations. %Different from the existing color image processing models, The proposed SLRQA is a quaternion model that combines low-rankness and sparsity priors. Furthermore, it does not need an initial rank estimate. To solve the SLRQA model, a nonconvex proximal linearized ADMM (PL-ADMM) algorithm is proposed. %where only one variable is linearized. Furthermore, the global convergence analysis of the PL-ADMM under mild assumptions is presented. When the observation is noise-free, an SLRQA-NF model of the limiting case of the SLRQA is proposed. Subsequently, a nonconvex proximal linearized ADMM (PL-ADMM-NF) algorithm for the SLRQA-NF is given. % Extensive numerical experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of quaternion representation. In numerical experiments, we verify the effectiveness of quaternion representation. Furthermore, for color image denoising and color image inpainting problems, SLRQA and SLRQA-NF models demonstrate superior performance both quantitatively and visually when compared with some state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Flow shops with reentry: Total completion time optimal schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow shops are widely studied machine environments in which all jobs must visit all machines in the same order. While conventional flow shops assume that each job traverses the shop only once, many industrial environments require jobs to pass through the shop multiple times before completion. This means that after traversing the shop and completing its processing on the last machine, a job must return to the first machine and traverse the shop again until it has completed all its required loops. Such a setting, referred to as a flow shop with reentry, has numerous applications in industry, e.g., semiconductor manufacturing. The planning problem is to schedule all loops of all jobs while minimizing the total (weighted) completion time. In this paper, we consider reentrant flow shops with unit processing times. We propose the Least Remaining Loops First (LRL) priority rule and show that it minimizes the total completion time. Furthermore, we analyze the complexity of minimizing the total weighted completion time when the jobs have different weights. We show that this problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense and provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. Additionally, we propose the Weighted Least Remaining Loops First (WLRL) priority rule and show that it has a worst-case performance ratio of about 1.2.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concentrates on the minimal hitting probability of continuous-time controlled Markov systems (CTCMSs) with countable state and finite admissible action spaces. The existence of an optimal policy is first proved. In particular, for a special and important case of controlled branching processes (CBPs), it is proved that the minimal hitting probability is the unique solution to an improved optimal system of equations. Furthermore, a novel and precise improved-policy iteration algorithm of an optimal policy and the minimal hitting probability (minimal extinction probability) is presented for CBPs.</description>

      <title>A global optimization approach for antenna design using analytical derivatives from high-frequency simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antennas are more prevalent than ever enabling 5G connectivity for wide ranging applications like cellular communication, IoT, autonomous vehicles, etc. Optimizing an antenna design can be challenging and employing traditional optimization techniques oftentimes require evaluating ~100s of design variations, which is time prohibitive to tight design deadlines. Instead, the common optimization approach relies on engineering expertise and solving only a handful design variations to manually determine a design with good-enough performance. Here, we present a novel approach for antenna optimization, which utilizes analytical derivatives calculated by Ansys HFSS to dramatically reduce the number of necessary simulation runs. In the presented approach a local updating scheme, which converges quickly to the next local optimum, is extended to a global search strategy intended to detect several local and global optima. This global search procedure uses a consistent interpolation model to approximate the simulation model outputs and its derivatives depending on the design parameters values. The presented approach is implemented in an optimization workflow, which automatically interacts with the HFSS simulation model. Since this optimizer relies on the analytical derivatives calculated by HFSS, it is applicable to any design optimization where geometry or material properties are varied, and the device response is described by SYZ-parameters or far-field quantities. The usability of this new optimizer is therefore wide ranging from antenna design to signal integrity applications.</description>

      <title>Cubic NK-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Parametric Dictionary in Frequency Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel parametric dictionary learning algorithm for line spectral estimation, applicable in both single measurement vector (SMV) and multiple measurement vectors (MMV) scenarios. This algorithm, termed cubic Newtonized K-SVD (NK-SVD), extends the traditional K-SVD method by incorporating cubic regularization into Newton refinements. The proposed Gauss-Seidel scheme not only enhances the accuracy of frequency estimation over the continuum but also achieves better convergence by incorporating higher-order derivative information. We rigorously establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm within the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence analysis of BCD with a higher-order regularization scheme. Furthermore, this convergence framework can be applied to designing general alternating minimization algorithms with higher-order regularization. Extensive simulations demonstrate that cubic NK-SVD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both SMV and MMV settings.</description>

      <title>Efficient Digital Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Solvers for SAT Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a propositional logic problem of determining whether an assignment of variables satisfies a Boolean formula. Many combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated in Boolean SAT logic -- either as k-SAT decision problems or Max k-SAT optimization problems, with conflict-driven (CDCL) solvers being the most prominent. Despite their ability to handle large instances, CDCL-based solvers have fundamental scalability limitations. In light of this, we propose recently-developed quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solvers as an alternative platform for 3-SAT problems. To utilize them, we implement a 2-step [3-SAT]-[Max 2-SAT]-[QUBO] conversion procedure and present a rigorous proof to explicitly calculate the number of both satisfied and violated clauses of the original 3-SAT instance from the transformed Max 2-SAT formulation. We then demonstrate, through numerical simulations on several benchmark instances, that digital QUBO solvers can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on 78-variable 3-SAT benchmark problems. Our work facilitates the broader use of quantum annealers on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as their quantum-inspired digital counterparts, for solving 3-SAT problems.</description>

      <title>A time-dependent symplectic network for non-convex path planning problems with linear and nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture (TSympOCNet) to address high--dimensional optimal control problems with linear and nonlinear dynamics. An important application of this method is to solve the path planning problem of multi-agent vehicles in real time. The new method extends our previous SympOCNet framework by introducing a time-dependent symplectic network into the architecture. In addition, we propose a more general latent representation, which greatly improves model expressivity based on the universal approximation theorem. We demonstrate the efficacy of TSympOCNet in path planning problems with obstacle and collision avoidance, including systems with Newtonian dynamics and non-convex environments, up to dimension 512. Our method shows significant promise in handling efficiently both complex dynamics and constraints.</description>

      <title>Multilinear Extensions in Submodular Optimization for Optimal Sensor Scheduling in Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal sensing nodes selection in dynamic systems is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been thoroughly studied in the recent literature. This problem can be formulated within the context of set optimization. For high-dimensional nonlinear systems, the problem is extremely difficult to solve. It scales poorly too. Current literature poses combinatorial submodular set optimization problems via maximizing observability performance metrics subject to matroid constraints. Such an approach is typically solved using greedy algorithms that require lower computational effort yet often yield sub-optimal solutions. In this letter, we address the sensing node selection problem for nonlinear dynamical networks using a variational form of the system dynamics, that basically perturb the system physics. As a result, we show that the observability performance metrics under such system representation are indeed submodular. The optimal problem is then solved using the multilinear continuous extension. This extension offers a computationally scalable and approximate continuous relaxation with a performance guarantee. The effectiveness of the extended submodular program is studied and compared to greedy algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed set optimization formulation for sensing node selection on nonlinear natural gas combustion networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an infinite dimensional partial differential equation of Isaacs' type, which arises from a zero-sum differential game between two masses. The evolution of the two masses is described by a controlled transport/continuity equation, where the control is given by the vector velocity field. Our study is set in the framework of the viscosity solutions theory in Hilbert spaces, and we prove the uniqueness of the value functions as solutions of the Isaacs equation.</description>

      <title>Variable Landscape Search: A Novel Metaheuristic Paradigm for Unlocking Hidden Dimensions in Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Variable Landscape Search (VLS), a novel metaheuristic designed to globally optimize complex problems by dynamically altering the objective function landscape. Unlike traditional methods that operate within a static search space, VLS introduces an additional level of flexibility and diversity to the global optimization process. It does this by continuously and iteratively varying the objective function landscape through slight modifications to the problem formulation, the input data, or both. The innovation of the VLS metaheuristic stems from its unique capability to seamlessly fuse dynamic adaptations in problem formulation with modifications in input data. This dual-modality approach enables continuous exploration of interconnected and evolving search spaces, significantly enhancing the potential for discovering optimal solutions in complex, multi-faceted optimization scenarios, making it adaptable across various domains. In this paper, one of the theoretical results is obtained in the form of a generalization of the following three alternative metaheuristics, which have been reduced to special cases of VLS: Variable Formulation Search (VFS), Formulation Space Search (FSS), and Variable Search Space (VSS). As a practical application, the paper demonstrates the superior efficiency of a recent big data clustering algorithm through its conceptualization using the VLS paradigm.</description>

      <title>A three-stage method for reconstructing multiple coefficients in coupled photoacoustic and diffuse optical imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>

      <title>A Convex-optimization-based Layer-wise Post-training Pruner for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pruning is a critical strategy for compressing trained large language models (LLMs), aiming at substantial memory conservation and computational acceleration without compromising performance. However, existing pruning methods often necessitate inefficient retraining for billion-scale LLMs or rely on heuristic methods such as the optimal brain surgeon framework, which degrade performance. In this paper, we introduce FISTAPruner, the first post-training pruner based on convex optimization models and algorithms. Specifically, we propose a convex optimization model incorporating $\ell_1$ norm to induce sparsity and utilize the FISTA solver for optimization. FISTAPruner incorporates an intra-layer cumulative error correction mechanism and supports parallel pruning. We comprehensively evaluate FISTAPruner on models such as OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and LLaMA-3 with 125M to 70B parameters under unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across various language benchmarks.</description>

      <title>State Estimator Design: Addressing General Delay Structures with Dissipative Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative estimator (observer) design for continuous time-delay systems poses a significant challenge when an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays (DDs) are concerned. We propose an effective solution to this semi-open problem using the Krasovski\u{\i} functional (KF) framework in conjunction with a quadratic supply rate function, where both the plant and the estimator can accommodate an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays with an unlimited number of square-integrable kernels. A key contribution is the introduction of a control concept called Kronecker-Seuret Decomposition (KSD) for matrix-valued functions, which allows for the factorizations or approximations of any DD integral kernel without introducing conservatism. Moreover, using KSD facilitates the construction of complete-type KFs with integral kernels that can contain any number of weakly differentiable and linearly independent functions. Our proposed solution is formulated as sequential convex SDP problems and is set out in two theorems along with an off-line iterative algorithm, which eliminates the need for nonlinear numerical solvers. We show the effectiveness of our method using two challenging numerical experiments, including a system stabilized by a non-smooth controller.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Transmission of Markov Sources over Noisy Channels: Belief Quantization vs Sliding Finite Window Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of zero-delay coding for the transmission a Markov source over a noisy channel with feedback and present a rigorous reinforcement theoretic solution which is guaranteed to achieve near-optimality. To this end, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the state is a probability-measure valued predictor/belief and the actions are quantizer maps. This MDP formulation has been used to show the optimality of certain classes of encoder policies in prior work. Despite such an analytical approach in determining optimal policies, their computation is prohibitively complex due to the uncountable nature of the constructed state space and the lack of minorization or strong ergodicity results which are commonly assumed for average cost optimal stochastic control. These challenges invite rigorous reinforcement learning methods, which entail several open questions addressed in our paper. We present two complementary approaches for this problem. In the first approach, we approximate the set of all beliefs by a finite set and use nearest-neighbor quantization to obtain a finite state MDP, whose optimal policies become near-optimal for the original MDP as the quantization becomes arbitrarily fine. In the second approach, a sliding finite window of channel outputs and quantizers together with a prior belief state serve as the state of the MDP. We then approximate this state by marginalizing over all possible beliefs, so that our coding policies only use the finite window term to encode the source. Under an appropriate notion of predictor stability, we show that such policies are near-optimal for the zero-delay coding problem as the window length increases. We give sufficient conditions for predictor stability to hold. Finally, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to compute near-optimal policies.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies regularity properties of optimization-based controllers, which are obtained by solving optimization problems where the parameter is the system state and the optimization variable is the input to the system. Under a wide range of assumptions on the optimization problem data, we provide an exhaustive collection of results about their regularity, and examine their implications on the existence and uniqueness of solutions and the forward invariance guarantees for the resulting closed-loop systems.

      <title>Dynamical State Feedback Control for Linear Input Delay Systems, Part I: Dissipative Stabilization via Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an SDP-based framework to address the stabilization of input delay systems while taking into account dissipative constraints. A key to our approach is the introduction of the concept of parameterized linear dynamical state feedbacks (LDSFs), which draws inspiration from recent advancements in the analyses of distributed delays. Importantly, the parameterized LDSFs generalize conventional predictor controllers, where the interpretation of state prediction is concealed and their degree of parameterization can be increased by adjusting the integral kernels. A sufficient condition for the existence of dissipative LDSFs is formulated as matrix inequalities by constructing a complete type Krasovski\u{\i} functional. To solve the bilinear matrix inequality in the synthesis condition, we employ an off-line inner convex approximation algorithm that can be initialized using the gains of predictor controllers obtained via explicit construction. Finally, the unknowns of our dissipative LTDS can be directly obtained by solving convex semidefinite programs. Numerical examples and simulations were experimented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Degenerate Simplex Pivots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simplex algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms to solve linear programs (LPs). Starting at an extreme point solution of an LP, it performs a sequence of basis exchanges (called pivots) that allows one to move to a better extreme point along an improving edge-direction of the underlying polyhedron. A key issue in the simplex algorithm's performance is degeneracy, which may lead to a (potentially long) sequence of basis exchanges which do not change the current extreme point solution. In this paper, we prove that it is always possible to limit the number of consecutive degenerate pivots that the simplex algorithm performs to $n-m-1$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of equality constraints of a given LP in standard equality form.</description>

      <title>Convergence and complexity of block majorization-minimization for constrained block-Riemannian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block majorization-minimization (BMM) is a simple iterative algorithm for nonconvex optimization that sequentially minimizes a majorizing surrogate of the objective function in each block coordinate while the other block coordinates are held fixed. We consider a family of BMM algorithms for minimizing smooth nonconvex objectives, where each parameter block is constrained within a subset of a Riemannian manifold. We establish that this algorithm converges asymptotically to the set of stationary points, and attains an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In particular, the assumptions for our complexity results are completely Euclidean when the underlying manifold is a product of Euclidean or Stiefel manifolds, although our analysis makes explicit use of the Riemannian geometry. Our general analysis applies to a wide range of algorithms with Riemannian constraints: Riemannian MM, block projected gradient descent, optimistic likelihood estimation, geodesically constrained subspace tracking, robust PCA, and Riemannian CP-dictionary-learning. We experimentally validate that our algorithm converges faster than standard Euclidean algorithms applied to the Riemannian setting.</description>

      <title>Avoiding strict saddle points of nonconvex regularized problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of non-convex and non-smooth sparse optimization problems, which encompass most existing nonconvex sparsity-inducing terms. We show the second-order optimality conditions only depend on the nonzeros of the stationary points. We propose two damped iterative reweighted algorithms including the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithm (DIRL$_1$) and the iteratively reweighted $\ell_2$ (DIRL$_2$) algorithm, to solve these problems. For DIRL$_1$, we show the reweighted $\ell_1$ subproblem has support identification property so that DIRL$_1$ locally reverts to a gradient descent algorithm around a stationary point. For DIRL$_2$, we show the solution map of the reweighted $\ell_2$ subproblem is differentiable and Lipschitz continuous everywhere. Therefore, the map of DIRL$_1$ and DIRL$_2$ and their inverse are Lipschitz continuous, and the strict saddle points are their unstable fixed points. By applying the stable manifold theorem, these algorithms are shown to converge only to local minimizers with randomly initialization when the strictly saddle point property is assumed.</description>

      <title>On Properties of Adjoint Systems for Evolutionary PDEs</title>

Abstract: We investigate the geometric structure of adjoint systems associated with evolutionary partial differential equations at the fully continuous, semi-discrete, and fully discrete levels and the relations between these levels. We show that the adjoint system associated with an evolutionary partial differential equation has an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian structure, which is useful for connecting the fully continuous, semi-discrete, and fully discrete levels. We subsequently address the question of discretize-then-optimize versus optimize-then-discrete for both semi-discretization and time integration, by characterizing the commutativity of discretize-then-optimize methods versus optimize-then-discretize methods uniquely in terms of an adjoint-variational quadratic conservation law. For Galerkin semi-discretizations and one-step time integration methods in particular, we explicitly construct these commuting methods by using structure-preserving discretization techniques.</description>

Abstract: Many industries widely adopted hub networks these days. Managing logistics, transportation, and distribution requires a delicate balance to ensure seamless operations within this network. Hub network promotes cost-effective routing through inter-hub flows. Failure of such hubs may impact the total network with huge costs. In this paper, we study bilevel $q$-allocation hub interdiction problem. In previous literature hub interdiction problem was studied with single and multiple allocation protocols.This problem focus on $q$ allocation which solves single and multiple allocation problem as special case. We also show improvements on the branch and cut approach by using cutting planes.Our experiments based on large instances present the efficiency of the approach to solve some previously unsolved instances.</description>

Abstract: Classical-quantum hybrid algorithms have recently garnered significant attention, which are characterized by combining quantum and classical computing protocols to obtain readout from quantum circuits of interest. Recent progress due to Lubasch et al in a 2019 paper provides readout for solutions to the Schrodinger and Inviscid Burgers equations, by making use of a new variational quantum algorithm (VQA) which determines the ground state of a cost function expressed with a superposition of expectation values and variational parameters. In the following, we analyze additional computational prospects in which the VQA can reliably produce solutions to other PDEs that are comparable to solutions that have been previously realized classically, which are characterized with noiseless quantum simulations. To determine the range of nonlinearities that the algorithm can process for other IVPs, we study several PDEs, first beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations and progressing to other equations underlying physical phenomena ranging from electromagnetism, gravitation, and wave propagation, from simulations of the Einstein, Boussniesq-type, Lin-Tsien, Camassa-Holm, Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW), and Hunter-Saxton equations. To formulate optimization routines that the VQA undergoes for numerical approximations of solutions that are obtained as readout from quantum circuits, cost functions corresponding to each PDE are provided in the supplementary section after which simulations results from hundreds of ZGR-QFT ansatzae are generated.</description>

      <title>Semi-on-Demand Hybrid Transit Route Design with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the route design of a semi-on-demand hybrid route directional service in the public transit network, offering on-demand flexible route service in low-density areas and fixed route service in higher-density areas with Shared Autonomous Mobility Service (SAMS). The study develops analytically tractable cost expressions that capture access, waiting, and riding costs for users, and distance-based operating and time-based vehicle costs for operators. Two formulations are presented for strategic and tactical decisions in flexible route portion, fleet size, headway, and vehicle size optimization, enabling the determination of route types between fixed, hybrid, and flexible routes based on demand, cost, and operational parameters. The practical applications and benefits of semi-on-demand feeders are demonstrated with numerical examples and a large-scale case study in the Chicago metropolitan area. Findings reveal scenarios in which flexible route portions serving passengers located further away reduce total costs, particularly user costs. Lower operating costs in lower-demand areas favor more flexible routes, whereas higher demand densities favor more traditional line-based operations. On two studied lines, a current cost forecast favors smaller vehicles with flexible routes, but operating constraints and higher operating costs would favor bigger vehicles with hybrid routes. The study provides an analytical tool to design SAMS as directional services and transit feeders, and tractable continuous approximation formulations for future research in transit network design.</description>
