      <title>Similarities among top one day batters: physics-based quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessment of the performance of a player in any sport is very much needed to determine the ranking of players and make a solid team with the best players. Besides these, fans, journalists, sports persons, and sports councils often analyse the performances of current and retired players to identify the best players of all time. Here, we study the performance of all-time top batters in one-day cricket using physics-based statistical methods. The batters are selected in this study who possess either higher total runs or a high number of centuries. It is found that the total runs increases linearly with the innings number at the later stage of the batter carrier, and the runs rate estimated from the linear regression analysis also increases linearly with the average runs. The probability of non-scoring innings is found to be a negligibly small number (i.e., $\leq 0.1$ ) for each batter. Furthermore, based on innings-wise runs, we have computed the six-dimensional probability distribution vector for each player. Two components of the probability distribution vector vary linearly with average runs. The component representing the probability of scoring runs less than 50 linearly decreases with the average runs. In contrast, the probability of scoring runs greater than or equal to 100 and less than 150 linearly increases with the average runs. We have also estimated the entropy to assess the diversity of a player. Interestingly, the entropy varies linearly with the average runs, giving rise to two clusters corresponding to the old and recent players. Furthermore, the angle between two probability vectors is calculated for each pair of players to measure the similarities among the players. It is found that some of the players are almost identical to each other.</description>

      <title>Why Teach Quantum In Your Own Time: The Values of Grassroots Organizations Involved in Quantum Technologies Education and Outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education. It delineates a fundamental distinction between the objective to provide education and the drive to democratize learning through principles of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.</description>

      <title>Investigation on centrality measures and opinion dynamics in two-layer networks with replica nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine two-layer networks and centrality measures defined on them. The propose two fast and accurate algorithms to approximate the game-theoretic centrality measures and examine connection between centrality measures and characteristics of opinion dynamic processes on such networks. As an example, we consider a Zachary's karate club social network and extend it by adding the second (internal) layer of communication. Internal layer represents the idea that individuals can share their real opinions with their close friends. The structures of the external and internal layers may be different. As characteristics of of opinion dynamic processes we mean consensus time and winning rate of a particular opinion. We find significantly strong positive correlation between internal graph density and consensus time, and significantly strong negative correlation between centrality of authoritative nodes and consensus time.</description>

      <title>Oligopoly Game Stabilisation Through Multilayer Congestion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: International trade and logistics are subject to factors including geopolitical instability, climate change, and black swan events such as the unforeseen closure of the Suez Canal. The problem of predicting local price change under modification of an underlying transport network or change in supply characteristics unites elements of game theory, network theory and transport. The Cournot Oligopoly models economic actors as rational players attempting to maximise profit by optimising supply quantities with analytical results now consolidated about equilibrium characteristics where transport conditions are fixed. Similarly, where supply and demand are fixed, the routing of goods in a transport network can be analytically solved through a traffic assignment problem. Hence we can solve the coupled Cournot-congestion problem by means of a 2-layer network. Where the layers are linked, inter-layer feedback wherein players attempt to maximise their utility occurs. In this respect we find players benefit from taking advantage of non-simultaneous responses to the market rather than moving to a new equilibrium. We draw conclusions about the nature of equilibria, finding that the concave utility curve property results in unique and stable equilibrium for each uncoupled layer, while linked layers have a non-unique stable equilibria for which general solutions are stated.</description>

      <title>"A network of mutualities of being": socio-material archaeological networks and biological ties at \c{C}atalh\"oy\"uk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in archaeogenomics have granted access to previously unavailable biological information with the potential to further our understanding of past social dynamics at a range of scales. However, to properly integrate these data within archaeological narratives, new methodological and theoretical tools are required. Effort must be put into finding new methods for weaving together different datasets where material culture and archaeogenomic data are both constitutive elements. This is true on a small scale, when we study relationships at the individual level, and at a larger scale when we deal with social and population dynamics. Specifically, in the study of kinship systems it is essential to contextualize and make sense of biological relatedness through social relations, which, in archaeology, is achieved by using material culture as a proxy. In this paper we propose a Network Science framework to integrate archaeogenomic data and material culture at an intrasite scale to study biological relatedness and social organization at the Neolithic site of \c{C}atalh\"oy\"uk. Methodologically, we propose the use of network variance to investigate the concentration of biological relatedness and material culture within networks of houses. This approach allowed us to observe how material culture similarity between buildings gives valuable information on potential biological relationships between individuals and how biogenetic ties concentrate at specific localities on site.</description>

      <title>CoDiNG -- Naming Game with Continuous Latent State of Agents</title>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind opinion formation is crucial for gaining insight into the processes that shape political beliefs, cultural attitudes, consumer choices, and social movements. This work aims to explore a nuanced model that captures the intricacies of real-world opinion dynamics by synthesizing principles from cognitive science and employing social network analysis. The proposed model is a hybrid continuous-discrete extension of the well-known Naming Game opinion model. The added latent continuous layer of opinion strength follows cognitive processes in the human brain, akin to memory imprints. The discrete layer allows for the conversion of intrinsic continuous opinion into discrete form, which often occurs when we publicly verbalize our opinions. We evaluated our model using real data as ground truth and demonstrated that the proposed mechanism outperforms the classic Naming Game model in many cases, reflecting that our model is closer to the real process of opinion formation.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices for measuring ex ante and ex post competitive balance in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while the ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

      <title>Shaping New Norms for AI</title>

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, the need for new norms is urgent. However, AI evolves at a much faster pace than the characteristic time of norm formation, posing an unprecedented challenge to our societies. This paper examines possible criticalities of the processes of norm formation surrounding AI. Thus, it focuses on how new norms can be established, rather than on what these norms should be. It distinguishes different scenarios based on the centralisation or decentralisation of the norm formation process, analysing the cases where new norms are shaped by formal authorities, informal institutions, or emerge spontaneously in a bottom-up fashion. On the latter point, the paper reports a conversation with ChatGPT in which the LLM discusses some of the emerging norms it has observed. Far from seeking exhaustiveness, this article aims to offer readers interpretive tools to understand society's response to the growing pervasiveness of AI. An outlook on how AI could influence the formation of future social norms emphasises the importance for open societies to anchor their formal deliberation process in an open, inclusive, and transparent public discourse.</description>

      <title>Geometrics of the Adjacent Possible: Harvesting Values at the Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novelty alone is not sufficient for innovation. For new ideas and products to thrive, they must find their place within the existing societal fabric, such as institutions, conventions, and infrastructures that have been built over time. Past successes create inertia, favoring conservative advances. Here, we develop a quantitative framework to map the contours of the adjacent possible in the presence of the power of typicality. Typical assemblies, frequently combined building blocks in past innovations, compress and curve the space of possibilities toward what is imaginable, accessible, and implementable, much like gravitational forces on new ideas and actions. We demonstrate that these curvatures in the space of possibilities are not just abstract constructs but empirically measurable through two complementary studies. We first show that Edison's inventions are primarily located in areas of high curvature, aligning with his strategy of building upon institutionalized domains. In contrast, Tesla's inventions are mainly found in low-curvature areas, indicating his propensity for exploring new territories and pushing innovation boundaries. Further analysis of the entire U.S. patent database reveals that innovations in high-curvature areas are more likely to yield monetary value. High-curvature areas indicate windows of opportunity through the interplay between innovation and convention, explaining why commercially successful ideas often emerge at the fringes of institutionalized domains.</description>

      <title>Anatomizing Societal Recovery at the Microscale: Heterogeneity in Household Lifestyle Activities Rebounding after Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a granular analysis of societal recovery from disasters at the individual level, focusing on the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Ida. Societal recovery is defined as the restoration of the societal functioning of the affected community to its normal/steady-state level. It evaluates the recovery of impacted residents based on fluctuations in their lifestyle patterns in visits to points of interest. The analysis focuses on: (1) the extent of heterogeneity in lifestyle recovery of residents in the same spatial area; and (2) the extent to which variations in lifestyle recovery and its heterogeneity among users can be explained based on hazard impact extent and social vulnerability. As lifestyle recovery progresses, heterogeneity diminishes, indicating that lower lifestyle recovery rates correlate with higher heterogeneity within a spatial area. This relationship between lifestyle recovery and heterogeneity can lead to the misestimation of recovery timelines, potentially resulting in the inefficient allocation of resources and disproportionate attention to already recovering communities. Key contributions of the study are fourfold: First, it characterizes societal recovery at the finest scale by examining fluctuations in individual lifestyles, revealing heterogeneity even among neighbors. Second, it proposes using individual lifestyle as an indicator of societal functioning to measure, more human centrically, disaster impacts and recovery speeds. Third, it introduces a method for quantifying lifestyle recovery that enables near-real-time monitoring, departing from traditional survey-based methods. Fourth, it provides empirical insights into the relationship between disaster impacts and societal recovery, showing that the severity of disaster impacts and resident income levels and percentage of minority populations influence recovery durations.</description>
