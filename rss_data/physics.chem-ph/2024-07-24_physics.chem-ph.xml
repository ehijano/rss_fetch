      <title>Anomalous Water Penetration in $\text{Al}^{3+}$ Dissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physicochemical characterization of trivalent ions is limited due to a lack of accurate force fields. By leveraging the latest machine learning force field to model aqueous $\text{AlCl}_{3}$, we discover that upon dissolution of $\text{Al}^{3+}$, water molecules beyond the second hydration shell involve in the hydration process. A combination of scissoring of coordinating water is followed by synchronized secondary motion of water in the second solvation shell due to hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the water beyond the second solvation penetrates through the second solvation shell and coordinates to the $\text{Al}^{3+}$. Our study reveals a novel microscopic understanding of solvation dynamics for trivalent ion.</description>

      <title>Rank-reduced equation-of-motion coupled cluster triples: an accurate and affordable way of calculating electronic excitation energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we report an implementation of the rank-reduced equation-of-motion coupled cluster method with approximate triple excitations (RR-EOM-CC3). The proposed variant relies on tensor decomposition techniques in order to alleviate the high cost of computing and manipulating the triply-excited amplitudes. In the RR-EOM-CC3 method, both ground-state and excited-state triple-excitation amplitudes are compressed according to the Tucker-3 format. This enables to factorize the working equations such that the formal scaling of the method is reduced to $N^6$, where $N$ is the system size. An additional advantage of our method is the fact the accuracy can be strictly controlled by proper choice of two parameters defining sizes of triple-excitation subspaces in the Tucker decomposition for the ground and excited states. Optimal strategies of selecting these parameters are discussed. The developed method has been tested in a series of calculations of electronic excitation energies and compared to its canonical EOM-CC3 counterpart. Errors several times smaller than the inherent error of the canonical EOM-CC3 method (in comparison to FCI) are straightforward to achieve. This conclusion holds both for valence states dominated by single excitations and for states with pronounced doubly-excited character. Taking advantage of the decreased scaling, we demonstrate substantial computational costs reductions (in comparison with the canonical EOM-CC3) in the case of two large molecules -- L-proline and heptazine. This illustrates the usefulness of the RR-EOM-CC3 method for accurate determination of excitation energies of large molecules.</description>

      <title>Very-Large-Scale GPU-Accelerated Nuclear Gradient of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory with Tamm-Dancoff Approximation and Range-Separated Hybrid Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) provide an unprecedented level of computing power. In this study, we present a high-performance, multi-GPU implementation of the analytical nuclear gradient for Kohn-Sham time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), employing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and Gaussian-type atomic orbitals as basis functions. We discuss GPU-efficient algorithms for the derivatives of electron repulsion integrals and exchange-correlation functionals within the range-separated scheme. As an illustrative example, we calculated the TDA-TDDFT gradient of the S1 state of a full-scale green fluorescent protein with explicit water solvent molecules, totaling 4353 atoms, at the wB97X/def2-SVP level of theory. Our algorithm demonstrates favorable parallel efficiencies on a high-speed distributed system equipped with 256 Nvidia A100 GPUs, achieving &gt;70% with up to 64 GPUs and 31% with 256 GPUs, effectively leveraging the capabilities of modern high-performance computing systems.</description>

      <title>Time resolved quantum tomography in molecular spectroscopy by the Maximal Entropy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond science offers unprecedented precision in probing the initial moments of chemical reactions, revealing the dynamics of molecular electrons that shape reaction pathways. A fundamental question emerges: what role, if any, do quantum coherences between molecular electron states play in photochemical reactions? Answering this question necessitates quantum tomography: the determination of the electronic density matrix from experimental data, where the off-diagonal elements represent these coherences. The Maximal Entropy (MaxEnt) based Quantum State Tomography (QST) approach offers unique advantages in studying molecular dynamics, particularly with partial tomographic data. Here, we explore the application of MaxEnt-based QST on photoexcited ammonia, necessitating the operator form of observables specific to the performed measurements. We present two methodologies for constructing these operators: one leveraging Molecular Angular Distribution Moments (MADMs) which accurately capture the orientation-dependent vibronic dynamics of molecules; and another utilizing Angular Momentum Coherence Operators to construct measurement operators for the full rovibronic density matrix in the symmetric top basis. A key revelation of our study is the direct link between Lagrange multipliers in the MaxEnt formalism and the unique set of MADMs. Furthermore, we achieve a groundbreaking milestone by constructing, for the first time, the entanglement entropy of the electronic subsystem: a metric that was previously inaccessible. The entropy vividly reveals and quantifies the effects of coupling between the excited electron and nuclear degrees of freedom. Consequently, our findings open new avenues for research in ultrafast molecular spectroscopy within the broader domain of quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of quantum fidelity kernels for Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_3$O$^+$, 15 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_2$CO and 88 cm$^{-1}$ for HNO$_2$. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of the Rydberg states of CO$_{2}$: Autoionization and Dissociation lifetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited states of carbon dioxide molecule using time-resolved pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy. Neutral ground state carbon dioxide is excited to $nd\sigma_g$ Henning sharp Rydberg states with an attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulse train. A time delayed near infrared probe pulse is used to photoionize these states to their corresponding ionization limit $B^2\Sigma_u^+$. We obtain differential kinetic energy spectrograms and angular distributions for photoionization and autoionization channels. We model the competition between predissociation and autoionization in the Rydberg state dynamics and analyze differential photoelectron yield as a function of the time delay to extract previously unknown autoionization and predissociation lifetimes for three Henning sharp states (n = 4, 5, 6).</description>

      <title>CheMFi: A Multifidelity Dataset of Quantum Chemical Properties of Diverse Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in both Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Chemistry (QC) methods have resulted in high accuracy ML models for QC properties. Datasets such as MD17 and WS22 have been used to benchmark these models at some level of QC method, or fidelity, which refers to the accuracy of the chosen QC method. Multifidelity ML (MFML) methods, where models are trained on data from more than one fidelity, have shown to be effective over single fidelity methods. Much research is progressing in this direction for diverse applications ranging from energy band gaps to excitation energies. One hurdle for effective research here is the lack of a diverse multifidelity dataset for benchmarking. We provide the quantum Chemistry MultiFidelity (CheMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. CheMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties such as vertical excitation properties and molecular dipole moments, further including QC computation times allowing for a time benefit benchmark of multifidelity models for ML-QC.</description>

      <title>A simple approach to rotationally invariant machine learning of avector quantity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike with the energy, which is a scalar property, machine learning (ML) predictions of vector or tensor properties poses the additional challenge of achieving proper invariance (covariance) with respect to molecular rotation. If the properties cannot be obtained by differentiation, other appropriate methods should be applied to retain the covariance. There have been several approaches suggested to properly treat this issue. For nonadiabatic couplings and polarizabilities, for example, it was possible to construct virtual quantities from which the above tensorial properties are obtained by differentiation and thus guarantee the covariance. Here we propose a simpler alternative technique, which does not require construction of auxiliary properties or application of special equivariant ML techniques. We suggest a three-step approach, using the molecular tensor of inertia. In the first step, the molecule is rotated using the eigenvectors of this tensor to its principal axes. In the second step, the ML procedure predicts the vector property relative to this orientation, based on a training set where all vector properties were in this same coordinate system. As third step, it remains to transform the ML estimate of the vector property back to the original orientation. This rotate-predict-rotate (RPR) procedure should thus guarantee proper covariance of a vector property and is trivially extensible also to tensors such as polarizability. The PRP procedure has an advantage that the accurate models can be trained very fast for thousands of molecular configurations which might be beneficial where many trainings are required (e.g., in active learning). We have implemented the RPR technique, using the MLatom and Newton-X programs for ML and MD and performed its assessment on the dipole moment along MD trajectories of 1,2-dichloroethane.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GPU-acceleration in the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe our contribution as industrial stakeholders to the existing open-source GPU4PySCF project (https: //github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf), a GPU-accelerated Python quantum chemistry package. We have integrated GPU acceleration into other PySCF functionality including Density Functional Theory (DFT), geometry optimization, frequency analysis, solvent models, and density fitting technique. Through these contributions, GPU4PySCF v1.0 can now be regarded as a fully functional and industrially relevant platform which we demonstrate in this work through a range of tests. When performing DFT calculations on modern GPU platforms, GPU4PySCF delivers 30 times speedup over a 32-core CPU node, resulting in approximately 90% cost savings for most DFT tasks. The performance advantages and productivity improvements have been found in multiple industrial applications, such as generating potential energy surfaces, analyzing molecular properties, calculating solvation free energy, identifying chemical reactions in lithium-ion batteries, and accelerating neural-network methods. With the improved design that makes it easy to integrate with the Python and PySCF ecosystem, GPU4PySCF is natural choice that we can now recommend for many industrial quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>
