      <title>Coding is hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central topic in mathematical logic is the classification of theorems from mathematics in hierarchies according to their logical strength. Ideally, the place of a theorem in a hierarchy does not depend on the representation (aka coding) used. In this paper, we show that the standard representation of compact metric spaces in second-order arithmetic has a profound effect. To this end, we study basic theorems for such spaces like a continuous function has a supremum and a countable set has measure zero. We show that these and similar third-order statements imply at least Feferman's highly non-constructive projection principle, and even full second-order arithmetic or countable choice in some cases. When formulated with representations (aka codes), the associated second-order theorems are provable in rather weak fragments of second-order arithmetic. Thus, we arrive at the slogan that coding compact metric spaces in the language of second-order arithmetic can be as hard as second-order arithmetic or countable choice. We believe every mathematician should be aware of this slogan, as central foundational topics in mathematics make use of the standard second-order representation of compact metric spaces. In the process of collecting evidence for the above slogan, we establish a number of equivalences involving Feferman's projection principle and countable choice. We also study generalisations to fourth-order arithmetic and beyond with similar-but-stronger results.</description>

      <title>Globally valued fields: foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present foundations of globally valued fields, i.e., of a class of fields with an extra structure, capturing some aspects of the geometry of global fields, based on the product formula. We provide a dictionary between various data defining such extra structure: syntactic (models of some unbounded continuous logic theory), Arakelov theoretic, and measure theoretic. In particular we obtain a representation theorem relating globally valued fields and adelic curves defined by Chen and Moriwaki.</description>

      <title>Degrees of join-distributivity via Bruns-Lakser towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the Bruns-Lakser completion to introduce Bruns-Lakser towers of a meet-semilattice. This machinery enables us to develop various hierarchies inside the class of bounded distributive lattices, which measure $\kappa$-degrees of distributivity of bounded distributive lattices and their Dedekind-MacNeille completions. We also use Priestley duality to obtain a dual characterization of the resulting hierarchies. Among other things, this yields a natural generalization of Esakia's representation of Heyting lattices to proHeyting lattices.</description>

      <title>The further study on the category of T-convergence groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T-convergence groups is a natural extension of lattice-valued topological groups, which is a newly introduced mathematical structure. In this paper, we will further explore the theory of T-convergence groups. The main results include: (1) It possesses a novel characterization through the $\odot$-product of T-filters, and it is localizable, meaning that each T-convergence group is uniquely determined by the convergence at the identity element of the underlying group. (2) The definition of its subcategory, the topological T-convergence groups, can be simplified by removing the topological condition (TT). (3) It exhibits uniformization, which means that each T-convergence group can be reconstructed from a T-uniformly convergent space. (4) It possesses a power object, indicating that it has good category properties.</description>

      <title>Indiscernibles in monadically NIP theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove various results around indiscernibles in monadically NIP theories. First, we provide several characterizations of monadic NIP in terms of indiscernibles, mirroring previous characterizations in terms of the behavior of finite satisfiability. Second, we study (monadic) distality in hereditary classes and complete theories. Here, via finite combinatorics, we prove a result implying that every planar graph admits a distal expansion. Finally, we prove a result implying that no monadically NIP theory interprets an infinite group, and note an example of a (monadically) stable theory with no distal expansion that does not interpret an infinite group.</description>

      <title>Failure of Esakia's theorem in the monadic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Esakia's theorem states that Grzegorczyk's logic is the largest modal companion of intuitionistic propositional calculus. We prove that already the one-variable fragment of intuitionistic predicate calculus does not have the largest modal companion, yielding that Esakia's theorem fails in the monadic setting.</description>

      <title>Marginalia to a Theorem of Asper\'o and Schindler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a game-theoretic characterization of when a model of an infinitary propositional formula can be added by a proper, semiproper, and stationary-set-preserving poset. In the latter case, we also give a general sufficient condition for the existence of such a poset. We use this condition to give a somewhat different proof of the theorem of Asper\'o and Schindler, which states that $\mathsf{MM}^{++}$ implies Woodin's axiom $(*)$.</description>

      <title>Completions of Kleene's second model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate completions of partial combinatory algebras (pcas), in particular of Kleene's second model $\mathcal{K}_2$ and generalizations thereof. We consider weak and strong notions of embeddability and completion that have been studied before in the literature. It is known that every countable pca can be weakly embedded into $\mathcal{K}_2$, and we generalize this to arbitrary cardinalities by considering generalizations of $\mathcal{K}_2$ for larger cardinals. This emphasizes the central role of $\mathcal{K}_2$ in the study of pcas. We also show that $\mathcal{K}_2$ and its generalizations have strong completions.</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for Cyclic Proofs: A Case Study in Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider modal logic extended with the well-known temporal operator `eventually' and provide a cut-elimination procedure for a cyclic sequent calculus that captures this fragment. The work showcases an adaptation of the reductive cut-elimination method to cyclic calculi. Notably, the proposed algorithm applies to a cyclic proof and directly outputs a cyclic cut-free proof without appealing to intermediate machinery for regularising the end proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl's interpretation of quantified formulas should not be conflated with Hilbert's. His semantic reasons for rejecting the law of excluded middle are based on a normative conception of transfinite mathematics as a system of conditional obligations.</description>
