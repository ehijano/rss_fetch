      <title>The Homotopy Theory of $A_\infty$Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the homotopy category of the $A_\infty$categories. To do that we introduce the notion of semi-free $A_\infty$category, which plays the role of standard cofibration. Moreover, we define the non unital $A_\infty$ (resp. DG)categories with cofibrant morphisms and we prove that any non unital $A_\infty$ (resp. DG)category has a resolution of this kind.</description>

      <title>On weighted bounded negativity for rational surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted bounded negativity conjecture considers a smooth projective surface $X$ and looks for a common lower bound on the quotients $C^2/(D\cdot C)^2$, where $C$ runs over the integral curves on $X$ and $D$ over the big and nef divisors on $X$ such that $D \cdot C &gt;0$. We focus our study on rational surfaces $Z$. Setting $\pi: Z \rightarrow Z_0$ a composition of blowups giving rise to $Z$, where $Z_0$ is the projective plane or a Hirzebruch surface, we give a common lower bound on $C^2/(H^* \cdot C)^2$ whenever $H^*$ is the pull-back of a nef divisor $H$ on $Z_0$. In addition, we prove that, only in the case when a nef divisor $D$ on $Z$ approaches the boundary of the nef cone, the quotients $C^2/(D\cdot C)^2$ could tend to minus infinity.</description>

      <title>Group theoretic properties of Clifford multiplication on 2-torsion points on the Dirac Spinor Abelian Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we consider a special complex torus, denoted $S_{\Delta_{2k}}$ (for each $k \in \mathbb{N},\, k \geq 1$) and called the Dirac spinor torus. It is an Abelian variety of complex dimension $2^{k}$ whose covering space is the space of Dirac spinors, $\Delta_{2k}$, for the Clifford algebra $Cl(\mathbb{C}^{2k})$ associated with the vector space $\mathbb{C}^{2k}$. Fixing an isomorphism $\rho:Cl(\mathbb{C}^{2k})\rightarrow End (\Delta_{2k})$, we define Clifford multiplication on $S_{\Delta_{2k}}$ as the actions of those endomorphisms in the image of $\rho$ that preserve the full rank lattice. We analyze the properties of that Clifford multiplication on the 2-torsion points of the Dirac spinor torus. We identify the Clifford actions with permutation maps that represent all isomorphism classes of these actions on the group of 2-torsion points. We provide a structure theorem describing these isomorphism classes of Clifford actions in a way that is independent of the choice of representatives. We conclude by extending the scope of our analysis to the group of $n$-torsion points and analyzing the fixed points and translation constants of entry-permuting maps, a broader class of actions of which the Clifford actions on the 2-torsion points of $S_{\Delta_{2k}}$ is a subset.</description>

      <title>The motive of a variety with cellular resolution of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex variety $X$ admits a \emph{cellular resolution of singularities} if there exists a resolution of singularities $\widetilde X\to X$ such that its exceptional locus as well as $\widetilde X$ and the singular locus of $X$ admit a cellular decomposition. We give a concrete description of the motive with compact support of $X$ in terms of its Borel--Moore homology, under some mild conditions. We give many examples, including rational projective curves and toric varieties of dimension two and three.</description>

      <title>Weak Brill-Noether on Abelian Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of a general stable sheaf on an abelian surface. We say that a moduli space satisfies weak Brill-Noether if the general sheaf has at most one non-zero cohomology group. Let $(X,H)$ be a polarized abelian surface and let $\mathbf{v}=(r,\xi,a)$ be a Mukai vector on $X$ with $\mathbf{v}^2\ge 0$,$r&gt;0$, and $\xi\cdot H&gt;0$. We show that if $\rho(X)=1$ or $\rho(X)=2$ and $X$ contains an elliptic curve, then all the moduli spaces $M_{X,H}(\mathbf{v})$ satisfy weak Brill-Noether. Conversely, if $\rho(X)&gt;2$ or $\rho(X)=2$ and $X$ does not contain an elliptic curve, we show that there are infinitely many moduli spaces $M_{X,H}(\mathbf{v})$ that fail weak Brill-Noether. As a consequence, we classify Chern classes of Ulrich bundles on abelian surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the deformation theory of Fourier-Mukai transforms between Calabi-Yau varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformation theory of fully faithful Fourier-Mukai transforms in both characteristic zero and mixed characteristic. Our main result shows that obstructions to deforming such transforms can be completely controlled by Hodge theory when the source variety has trivial canonical bundle, generalizing work of Addington-Thomas and Lieblich-Olsson. The main technical contribution is a formula for the obstruction class measuring the failure of a Chern character to remain within the Hodge filtration as a cup product with a (derived) Kodaira-Spencer class.</description>

      <title>Generic motives and motivic cohomology of fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are devoted to the study of generic motives and their application to the structure of the motivic cohomology of fields. Related to Voevodsky's homotopy $t$-structure on motivic complexes, generic motives are also central to the conjectural motivic $t$-structure, as was shown by Beilinson. Morphisms of generic motives are closely related to the functoriality of Rost's cycle modules. e obtain some new computations of generic motives, and deduce computations of morphisms of generic motives, which draw a conjectural picture.
  The structure of generic motives reflects into that of motivic cohomology of fields. After giving a new argument for determining weights in the K-theory of number fields using Borel's isomorphism, we deduce that many motivic cohomology groups of fields have infinite rank, usually of the same cardinality as the field itself. As an example motivic cohomology groups of the real or complex numbers are shown to be uncountable in many degrees and twists. Despite these results, we formulate a hope on their behavior with respect to transcendental elements, providing a counterpart to the Beilinson-Soul\'e vanishing conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Bieri-Neumann-Strebel sets of quasi-projective groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex quasi-projective variety and $\Gamma=\pi_1(X)$. Let $\chi \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ be an additive character. We prove that the ray $[\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ if and only if it comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \colon X \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. We also prove that if $\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually nilpotent, there exists a finite \'etale cover $X_1 \to X$ and a fibration $f \colon X_1 \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\Gamma$ is virtually solvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of Delzant and Arapura-Nori. We give two applications of our results. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on virtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and weakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical bound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and answer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>Gauss--Bonnet for CSM classes of very affine manifolds, and tropical isotopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CSM class of a very affine manifold $U$ is represented by the rank drop locus of a general tuple of torus invariant 1-forms on it. This equality holds in the homology of any toric compactification $X\supset U$. It was proved for sch\"on $U$ by Huh, and later for all $U$ in the homology of $X=CP^n$ by Maxim--Rodriguez--Wang--Wu, using Ginsburg's interpretation of CSM classes as Lagrangian cycles.
  We deduce this identity in full generality from properties of affine characteristic classes, give an explicit sufficient condition of general position for the 1-forms, and use it to extend the identity to non-torus invariant 1-forms. Along the way, we characterize very affine varieties of ML degree 0, and give a useful criterion for a family of varieties to have a constant tropical fan (``tropical isotopy theorem'').
  Our main idea is a technique to study very affine varieties without compactifying them. As a result we do not have to deal with singularities occuring at the boundary of the compactification, which would require less constructive methods (such as resolution of singularities). This is what enables us to give constructive genericity conditions in this Gauss--Bonnet theorem.</description>

      <title>Loop Grassmannian of quivers and Compactified Coulomb branch of quiver gauge theory with no framing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mirkovi\'c introduced the notion of loop Grassmannian for symmetric integer matrix $\kappa$. It is a two-step limit of the local projective space $Z_{\kappa}^{\alpha}$, which generalizes the usual Zastava for a simply laced group $G$. The usual loop Grassmannian of $G$ is recovered when the matrix $\kappa$ is the Cartan matrix of $G$.
  On the other hand, Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima showed that the Compactified Coulomb branch $\mathbf{M}_{Q}^{\alpha}$ for the quiver gauge theory with no framing also generalizes the usual Zastava. We show that in the case when $\kappa$ is the associated matrix of the quiver $Q$, these two generalizations of Zastava coincide, i.e $\mathbf{M}_{Q}^{\alpha}\cong Z_{\kappa(Q)}^{\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Enumerative geometry via elliptic stable envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assume $X$ is a variety for which the elliptic stable envelope exists. In this note we construct natural $q$-difference equations from the elliptic stable envelope of $X$. In examples, these equations coincide with the quantum difference equations, which give a natural $q$-deformation of the Dubrovin connection of $X$. Solutions of the quantum difference equations provide generating functions counting curves in $X$. In this way, our construction connects curve counting and equivariant elliptic cohomology.
  This is an overview paper based on the author's talk at the workshop The 16th MSJ-SI: Elliptic Integrable Systems, Representation Theory and Hypergeometric Functions, Tokyo 2023.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Gaiotto's conformal limit for the $G^{\mathbb{R}}$-Hitchin equations, when $G^{\mathbb{R}}$ is a simple real Lie group admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure. We identify a family of flat connections coming from certain solutions to the equations for which the conformal limit exists and admits the structure of an oper. We call this new class of opers appearing in the conformal limit $\Theta$-positive opers. The two families involved are parameterized by the same base space. This space is a generalization of the base of Hitchin's integrable system in the case when the structure group is a split real group.</description>

      <title>The weighted Hermite--Einstein equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new weighted version of the Hermite--Einstein equation, along with notions of weighted slope (semi/poly)stability, and prove that a vector bundle admits a weighted Hermite--Einstein metric if and only if it is weighted slope polystable. The new equation encompasses several well-known examples of canonical Hermitian metrics on vector bundles, including the usual Hermite--Einstein metrics, K\"ahler--Ricci solitons, and transversally Hermite--Einstein metrics on certain Sasaki manifolds. We prove that the equation arises naturally as a moment map, that solutions to the equation are unique up to scaling, and demonstrate a weighted Kobayashi--L\"ubke inequality satisfied by vector bundles admitting a weighted Hermite--Einstein metric. As an application of our techniques, we extend a bound of Tian on the Ricci curvature to a bound on a modified Ricci curvature, related to the existence of K\"ahler--Ricci solitons. Along the way, we introduce a new weighted vortex equation, as well as a weighted analogue of Gieseker stability. A key technical point is the application of a new extension of Inoue's equivariant intersection numbers to arbitrary weight functions on the moment polytope of a K\"ahler manifold with Hamiltonian torus action.</description>

      <title>The six-functor formalism for rigid analytic motives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.15004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer a systematic study of rigid analytic motives over general rigid analytic spaces, and we develop their six-functor formalism. A key ingredient is an extended proper base change theorem that we are able to justify by reducing to the case of algebraic motives. In fact, more generally, we develop a powerful technique for reducing questions about rigid analytic motives to questions about algebraic motives, which is likely to be useful in other contexts as well. We pay special attention to establishing our results without noetherianity assumptions on rigid analytic spaces. This is indeed possible using Raynaud's approach to rigid analytic geometry.</description>

      <title>Vector-valued orthogonal modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This monograph is devoted to the theory of vector-valued modular forms for orthogonal groups of signature (2,n). Our purpose is multi-layered: (1) to lay a foundation of the theory of vector-valued orthogonal modular forms; (2) to develop some aspects of the theory in more depth such as geometry of the Siegel operators, filtrations associated to 1-dimensional cusps, decomposition of vector-valued Jacobi forms, square integrability etc; and (3) as applications derive several types of vanishing theorems for vector-valued modular forms of small weight. Our vanishing theorems imply in particular vanishing of holomorphic tensors of degree &lt;n/2-1 on orthogonal modular varieties, which is optimal as a general bound.
  The fundamental ingredients of the theory are the two Hodge bundles. The first is the Hodge line bundle which already appears in the theory of scalar-valued modular forms. The second Hodge bundle emerges in the vector-valued theory and plays a central role. It corresponds to the non-abelian part O(n,R) of the maximal compact subgroup of O(2,n). The main focus of this monograph is centered around the properties and the role of the second Hodge bundle in the theory of vector-valued orthogonal modular forms.</description>

      <title>Rational singularities for moment maps of totally negative quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14791v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the zero-fiber of the moment map of a totally negative quiver has rational singularities. Our proof consists in generalizing dimension bounds on jet spaces of this fiber, which were introduced by Budur. We also transfer the rational singularities property to other moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories, based on recent work of Davison. This has interesting arithmetic applications on quiver moment maps and moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories. First, we generalize results of Wyss on the asymptotic behaviour of counts of jets of quiver moment maps over finite fields. Moreover, we interpret the limit of counts of jets on a given moduli space as its p-adic volume under a canonical measure analogous to the measure built by Carocci, Orecchia and Wyss on certain moduli spaces of coherent sheaves.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Local Cohomology with Applications to Hodge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\textbf{H} = ((H, F^{\bullet}), L)$ be a polarized variation of Hodge structure on a smooth quasi-projective variety $U.$ By M. Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules, the variation of Hodge structure $\textbf{H}$ can be viewed as a polarized Hodge module $\mathcal{M} \in HM(U).$ Let $X$ be a compactification of $U,$ and $j:U \hookrightarrow X$ is the natural map. In this paper, we use local cohomology with mixed Hodge module theory to study $j_{+}\mathcal{M} \in D^{b}MHM(X).$ In particular, we study the graded pieces of the de Rham complex $Gr^{F}_{p}DR(j_{+}\mathcal{M}) \in D^{b}_{coh}(X),$ and the Hodge structure of $H^{i}(U,L)$ for $i$ in sufficiently low degrees.</description>

      <title>Resolutions of toric subvarieties by line bundles and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any toric subvariety $Y$ of a smooth toric variety $X$ of codimension $k$, we construct a length $k$ resolution of $\mathcal O_Y$ by line bundles on $X$. Furthermore, these line bundles can all be chosen to be direct summands of the pushforward of $\mathcal O_X$ under the map of toric Frobenius. The resolutions are built from a stratification of a real torus that was introduced by Bondal and plays a role in homological mirror symmetry. As a corollary, we obtain a virtual analogue of Hilbert's syzygy theorem for smooth projective toric varieties conjectured by Berkesch, Erman, and Smith. Additionally, we prove that the Rouquier dimension of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a toric variety is equal to the dimension of the variety, settling a conjecture of Orlov for these examples. We also prove Bondal's claim that the pushforward of the structure sheaf under toric Frobenius generates the derived category of a smooth toric variety and formulate a refinement of Uehara's conjecture that this remains true for arbitrary line bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study mixed Hodge structures on the cohomology of locally symmetric varieties and give an application to modular forms. After proving vanishing of some Hodge numbers, we focus on the weight filtration on the last Hodge subspace of the middle degree cohomology. We prove that the weight filtration coincides with the corank filtration on the space of modular forms of canonical weight defined by the Siegel operators, and calculate the graded quotients. As an application, we deduce surjectivity of the total Siegel operators in many cases, and identify an obstruction space in the remaining case.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions for line bundles on nodal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract notion of a \emph{smoothable fine compactified Jacobian} of a nodal curve, and of a family of nodal curves whose general element is smooth. Then we introduce the notion of a combinatorial stability condition for line bundles and their degenerations. We prove that smoothable fine compactified Jacobians are in bijection with these stability conditions. We then turn our attention to \emph{fine compactified universal Jacobians}, that is, fine compactified Jacobians for the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_g$ of stable curves (without marked points). We prove that every fine compactified universal Jacobian is isomorphic to the one first constructed by Caporaso, Pandharipande and Simpson in the nineties. In particular, without marked points, there exists no fine compactified universal Jacobian unless $\gcd(d+1-g, 2g-2)=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a homogeneous polynomial of even degree $d$. We study the decompositions $f=\sum_{i=1}^r f_i^2$ where $\mathrm{deg} f_i=d/2$. The minimal number of summands $r$ is called the $2$-rank of $f$, so that the polynomials having $2$-rank equal to $1$ are exactly the squares. Such decompositions are never unique and they are divided into $\mathrm{O}(r)$-orbits, the problem becomes counting how many different $\mathrm{O}(r)$-orbits of decomposition exist. We say that $f$ is $\mathrm{O}(r)$-identifiable if there is a unique $\mathrm{O}(r)$-orbit. We give sufficient conditions for generic and specific $\mathrm{O}(r)$-identifiability. Moreover, we show the generic $\mathrm{O}(r)$-identifiability of ternary forms.</description>

Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

Abstract: We set up a generalization of ubiquitous one parameter families in algebraic geometry and its use for stability theories ([Mum65, HL14, AHLH23]) to families over toric varieties, Novikov type rings, or its complex analytic analogues. The language allows us to reformulate degenerations of "irrational" direction in various literatures as canonical objects in a unified manner.
  Compatibly, we generalize the stable reduction type theorem for $\Theta$-stratification in [AHLH23] of Langton type to our higher rank setup.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{X}$ be a smooth connected $p$-adic formal scheme. Based on the prismatic description of crystalline local systems, we prove an analogue of Fontaine's conjecture for torsion crystalline local systems on the generic fiber of $\mathfrak{X}$. As an application, we show that the locus of crystalline local systems whose Hodge-Tate weights lie in a fixed interval cuts out a closed subscheme of the universal deformation ring.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials III: actions by classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of isomorphism problems for d-way arrays, or tensors, under natural actions by classical groups such as orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. Such problems arise naturally in statistical data analysis and quantum information. We study two types of complexity-theoretic questions. First, for a fixed action type (isomorphism, conjugacy, etc.), we relate the complexity of the isomorphism problem over a classical group to that over the general linear group. Second, for a fixed group type (orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic), we compare the complexity of the decision problems for different actions.
  Our main results are as follows. First, for orthogonal and symplectic groups acting on 3-way arrays, the isomorphism problems reduce to the corresponding problem over the general linear group. Second, for orthogonal and unitary groups, the isomorphism problems of five natural actions on 3-way arrays are polynomial-time equivalent, and the d-tensor isomorphism problem reduces to the 3-tensor isomorphism problem for any fixed d&gt;3. For unitary groups, the preceding result implies that LOCC classification of tripartite quantum states is at least as difficult as LOCC classification of d-partite quantum states for any d. Lastly, we also show that the graph isomorphism problem reduces to the tensor isomorphism problem over orthogonal and unitary groups.</description>

      <title>Generalized GM-MDS: Polynomial Codes are Higher Order MDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GM-MDS theorem, conjectured by Dau-Song-Dong-Yuen and proved by Lovett and Yildiz-Hassibi, shows that the generator matrices of Reed-Solomon codes can attain every possible configuration of zeros for an MDS code. The recently emerging theory of higher order MDS codes has connected the GM-MDS theorem to other important properties of Reed-Solomon codes, including showing that Reed-Solomon codes can achieve list decoding capacity, even over fields of size linear in the message length.
  A few works have extended the GM-MDS theorem to other families of codes, including Gabidulin and skew polynomial codes. In this paper, we generalize all these previous results by showing that the GM-MDS theorem applies to any polynomial code, i.e., a code where the columns of the generator matrix are obtained by evaluating linearly independent polynomials at different points. We also show that the GM-MDS theorem applies to dual codes of such polynomial codes, which is non-trivial since the dual of a polynomial code may not be a polynomial code. More generally, we show that GM-MDS theorem also holds for algebraic codes (and their duals) where columns of the generator matrix are chosen to be points on some irreducible variety which is not contained in a hyperplane through the origin. Our generalization has applications to constructing capacity-achieving list-decodable codes as shown in a follow-up work by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi-Zhang, where it is proved that randomly punctured algebraic-geometric (AG) codes achieve list-decoding capacity over constant-sized fields.</description>

      <title>AG Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity over Constant-sized Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently-emerging field of higher order MDS codes has sought to unify a number of concepts in coding theory. Such areas captured by higher order MDS codes include maximally recoverable (MR) tensor codes, codes with optimal list-decoding guarantees, and codes with constrained generator matrices (as in the GM-MDS theorem).
  By proving these equivalences, Brakensiek-Gopi-Makam showed the existence of optimally list-decodable Reed-Solomon codes over exponential sized fields. Building on this, recent breakthroughs by Guo-Zhang and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li have shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity (which is a relaxation of optimal list-decodability) over linear size fields. We extend these works by developing a formal theory of relaxed higher order MDS codes. In particular, we show that there are two inequivalent relaxations which we call lower and upper relaxations. The lower relaxation is equivalent to relaxed optimal list-decodable codes and the upper relaxation is equivalent to relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column.
  We then generalize the techniques of GZ and AGL to show that both these relaxations can be constructed over constant size fields by randomly puncturing suitable algebraic-geometric codes. For this, we crucially use the generalized GM-MDS theorem for polynomial codes recently proved by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi. We obtain the following corollaries from our main result. First, randomly punctured AG codes of rate $R$ achieve list-decoding capacity with list size $O(1/\epsilon)$ and field size $\exp(O(1/\epsilon^2))$. Prior to this work, AG codes were not even known to achieve list-decoding capacity. Second, by randomly puncturing AG codes, we can construct relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column over constant-sized fields, whereas (non-relaxed) MR tensor codes require exponential field size.</description>

      <title>Interpolation in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over an algebraically closed field, the $\textit{double point interpolation}$ problem asks for the vector space dimension of the projective hypersurfaces of degree $d$ singular at a given set of points. After being open for 90 years, a series of papers by J. Alexander and A. Hirschowitz in 1992--1995 settled this question in what is referred to as the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem. In this paper we primarily use commutative algebra to lay the groundwork necessary to prove analogous statements in the $\textit{weighted projective space}$, a natural generalization of the projective space. We show the Hilbert function of general simple points in any $n$-dimensional weighted projective space exhibits the expected behavior. We give an inductive procedure for weighted projective space, similar to that originally due to A. Terracini from 1915, to demonstrate an example of a weighted projective plane where the analogue of the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem holds without exceptions. We further adapt Terracini's lemma regarding secant varieties to give an interpolation bound for an infinite family of weighted projective planes.</description>
