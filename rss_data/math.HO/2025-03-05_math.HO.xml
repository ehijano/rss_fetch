      <title>Computational and Algebraic Structure of Board Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two methodologies in the area of computation theory to solve optimal strategies for board games such as Xi Gua Qi and Go. From experimental results, we find relevance to graph theory, matrix representation, and mathematical consciousness. We prove that the decision strategy of movement for Xi Gua Qi and Chinese checker games belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group over set Y={-1,0,1}. Additionally, the movement for any board game with two players belongs to a subset that is neither a ring nor a group from the razor of Occam. We derive the closed form of the transition matrix for any board game with two players such as chess and Chinese chess. We discover that the element of the transition matrix belongs to a rational number. We propose a different methodology based on algebra theory to analyze the complexity of board games in their entirety, instead of being limited solely to endgame results. It is probable that similar decision processes of people may also belong to a matrix representation that is neither a ring nor a group.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of the NYT daily word game Waffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combinatorics of permutations underlying the the daily word game Waffle, and learn why some games are easy to solve while extreme games are very hard. A perfect unscrambling must have precisely 11 orbits, with at least one of length 1, on the 21 squares. We also describe practical algorithms for studying Waffle.</description>
