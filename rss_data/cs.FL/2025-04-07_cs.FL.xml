      <title>Home Spaces and Semiflows for the Analysis of Parameterized Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After rapidly recalling basic notations of Petri Nets, home spaces, and semiflows, we focus on F+, the set of semiflows with non-negative coordinates where the notions of minimality of semiflows and minimality of supports are particularly critical to develop an effective analysis of invariants and behavioral properties of Petri Nets such as boundedness or even liveness. We recall known decomposition theorems considering semirings such as N or Q+, and then fields such as Q. The decomposition over N is being improved with a necessary and sufficient condition.
  Then, we regroup a number of properties (old and new) around the notions of home spaces and home states which in combination with semiflows are used to efficiently support the analysis of behavioral properties.
  We introduce a new result on the decidability of liveness under the existence of a home state. We end this section with new results about the structure and behavioral properties of Petri Nets, illustrating again the importance of considering semiflows with non-negative coordinates.
  As examples, we present two related Petri Net modeling arithmetic operations (one of which is an Euclidean division), illustrating how semiflows and home spaces can be used in analyzing the liveness of the parameterized model and underlining the efficiency brought by using minimal semiflows of minimal supports as well as the new results on the structure of the model.</description>
