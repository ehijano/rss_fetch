      <title>Higher-order evolutionary dynamics with game transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions are prevalent in real-world complex systems and exert unique influences on system evolution that cannot be captured by pairwise interactions. We incorporate game transitions into the higher-order prisoner's dilemma game model, where these transitions consistently promote cooperation. Moreover, in systems with game transitions, the fraction of higher-order interactions has a dual impact, either enhancing the emergence and persistence of cooperation or facilitating invasions that promote defection within an otherwise cooperative system.</description>

      <title>Mixed-feedback oscillations in the foraging dynamics of arboreal turtle ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a model for the dynamics of the flow into and out of a nest for the arboreal turtle ant $\textit{Cephalotes goniodontus}$ during foraging to investigate a possible mechanism for the emergence of oscillations. In our model, there is mixed dynamic feedback between the flow of ants between different behavioral compartments and the concentration of pheromone along trails. On one hand, the ants deposit pheromone along the trail, which provides a positive feedback by increasing rates of return to the nest. On the other hand, pheromone evaporation is a source of negative feedback, as it depletes the pheromone and inhibits the return rate. We prove that the model is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of pheromone feedback. Then we show that pheromone feedback can lead to a loss of stability of the equilibrium and onset of sustained oscillations in the flow in and out of the nest via a Hopf bifurcation. This analysis sheds light on a potential key mechanism that enables arboreal turtle ants to effectively optimize their trail networks to minimize traveled path lengths and eliminate graph cycles.</description>

      <title>Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Redefining Fitness: Evolution as a Dynamic Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to their living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness, defined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that this definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue, several authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms of the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show that fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping population dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this problem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed in this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also show how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems of evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in group-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit bridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning theory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.</description>
