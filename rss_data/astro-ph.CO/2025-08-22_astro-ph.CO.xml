      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Equilibration in the Merging Galaxy Cluster Abell 665</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy in a merger. Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ($M \sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations. Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0 \pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \pm 0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Interaction of polytropic dark energy in cosmological model: Constraints from observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting polytropic dark energy (PDE) model characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha \rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble parameter in the interacting scenario, and the model parameters are constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0}, \eta) $ are $(69.22^{+1.27}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.22^{+0.10}_{-0.12})$, $(69.23^{+1.27}_{-1.22},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.34^{+0.15}_{-0.17})$, and $(67.77^{+1.26}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,\\-0.02^{+0.10}_{-0.11})$ respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range, with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is $14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational wave dark sirens to choose between host galaxy weighting models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black hole (BBH) mergers,, an important source of gravitational-waves(GWs), are assumed to be hosted in galaxies. The probability of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models. However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case, and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a ~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of well-localised events.</description>

      <title>Classical constant electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study constant classical electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space, with potential implications for magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production. Treating the photon as a dynamical field, we show that sustaining a constant electric field in de Sitter requires a tachyonic photon mass of order the Hubble scale. This observation has physical implications, as it alters the infrared behaviour of the induced Schwinger current. Using an on-shell renormalization condition consistent with a tachyonic photon, we recompute the current for charged fermions and scalars, finding it to be finite and positive even in the massless limit of the charge carriers-contrary to earlier results predicting a puzzling negative IR divergence. For scalars, we include a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature, enabling us to analyze the conformal limit, where the current closely matches that of charged fermions.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with an emergent Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss new ideas that the Standard Model might be emergent with connection to electroweak vacuum stability and related consequences for cosmology. In this scenario, the gauge symmetries and particles of the Standard Model would be ``born'' in some phase transition at a large scale about $10^{16}$ GeV with the Standard Model parameters constrained by the requirement of vacuum stability.Emergent gauge symmetries are well known in condensed matter physics. Perhaps the Standard Model might also be emergent. In this case the particles would be the stable long range excitations of degrees of freedom that operate above the scale of emergence. The dark energy scale comes out with similar size to the tiny masses of light Majorana neutrinos. The emergence scenario comes with interesting constraints on possible dark matter structure. New physics at energy scales around $10^{16}$ GeV might be explored through its effects in the neutrino mass matrix plus using high frequency gravitational waves and polarisation observables in the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Measurement of circumgalactic extinction in the Kilo-Degree Survey's Data Release 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies reside in extended dark matter halos, but their baryonic content, especially dust, remains less well understood. We aim to investigate the amount and distribution of dust in galactic halos by measuring shifts in the observed magnitudes of background galaxies. Dust absorbs and scatters shorter-wavelength light, reddening background sources. We quantify this effect using multi-band magnitude shifts in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4, distinguishing it from achromatic magnification. Our pipeline is validated using MICE2 mock catalogues, and we explore potential systematics arising from galaxy selection, in contrast to previous quasar-based studies. Simulations show that input halo and dust masses can be recovered independently and jointly using galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and magnitude shifts. A minimum redshift separation of $\Delta z_{\mathrm B}\sim0.3$ and brightness cuts are required to minimise overlap effects and the effects of photometric noise, respectively. Applying our pipeline to KiDS data, we first confirm the achromaticity of magnitude shifts in five near-infrared filters ($ZYJHK_{\rm s}$). In optical bands ($ugri$), joint analysis constrains halo mass and dust mass to $0.2$ dex and $0.3$ dex, respectively, yielding $M_{\rm dust}=7.24^{+0.52}_{-0.64} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $\log(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm DM}/M_\odot)=12.33^{+0.08}_{-0.04}$. These results agree with previous studies and represent the first successful measurement of magnitude shifts and halo extinction with KiDS, confirming that galaxies reside in extended baryonic halos enriched by gas and dust from feedback processes.</description>

      <title>A dark matter hail: Detecting macroscopic dark matter with asteroids, planetary rings, and craters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter could be composed of macroscopic objects with large masses and geometric cross-sections spanning many decades. We investigate the potential interaction of such `stuff-sized' dark matter by considering its interactions with asteroids, planetary rings, and terrestrial bodies. This hail of dark matter could catastrophically destroy these Solar System objects, evaporate them from their orbits, or cause substantial cratering. We estimate these effects and use them to place competitive bounds on a wide, previously-unconstrained swathe of the dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Computing Nonlinear Power Spectra Across Dynamical Dark Energy Model Space with Neural ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show how to compute the nonlinear power spectrum across the entire $w(z)$ dynamical dark energy model space. Using synthetic $\Lambda$CDM data, I train a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to infer the evolution of the nonlinear matter power spectrum as a function of the background expansion and mean matter density across $\sim$$9 {\rm \ Gyr}$ of cosmic evolution. After training, the model generalises to {\it any} dynamical dark energy model parameterised by $w(z)$. With little optimisation, the neural ODE is accurate to within $4\%$ up to k = $5 \ h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Unlike simulation rescaling methods, neural ODEs naturally extend to summary statistics beyond the power spectrum that are sensitive to the growth history.</description>

      <title>Probing the scalar-induced gravitational waves with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope and the Square Kilometer Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy presents a promising opportunity to directly observe scalar-induced gravitational waves originating from the early universe. Future experiments, including ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo, the Pulsar Timing Array, and telescopes such as FAST and SKA, are poised to significantly enhance sensitivity to these gravitational waves. In this paper, we combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the stochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain scalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we consider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced gravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy density; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus establishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, the scalar spectral index of the power-law power spectrum is constrained to $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ from the combinations of CMB+BAO+SKA datasets in the upper limit scenario where scalar-induced gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. The constraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit scenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO datasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which could serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral index $\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index $\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators. The numerical findings clearly demonstrate the impact of the upper and lower limits provided by FAST or SKA.</description>

      <title>Study of the Connected Four-Point Correlation Function of Galaxies from DESI Data Release 1 Luminous Red Galaxy Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function (4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the gravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a significance of 14.7$\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness of this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and cross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch combinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness of the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation schemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce biases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield consistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF on the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data implies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the connected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The methodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a foundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.</description>

      <title>One-Electron Quantum Cyclotron as a Milli-eV Dark-Photon Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using trapped electrons as high-$Q$ resonators for detecting meV dark photon dark matter. When the rest energy of the dark photon matches the energy splitting of the two lowest cyclotron levels, the first excited state of the electron cyclotron will be resonantly excited. A proof-of-principle measurement, carried out with one electron, demonstrates that the method is background-free over a 7.4 day search. It sets a limit on dark photon dark matter at 148 GHz (0.6 meV) that is around 75 times better than previous constraints. Dark photon dark matter in the 0.1-1 meV mass range (20-200 GHz) could likely be detected at a similar sensitivity in an apparatus designed for dark photon detection.</description>

      <title>Highly Excited Electron Cyclotron for QCD Axion and Dark-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Independent connection in ACTion during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. Also, the role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>On quantum creation of a toroidal universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.</description>
