      <title>Investigating the hyperfine systematic error and relative phase in low spin-polarization alkali FID magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali-metal optically-pumped magnetometers are prone to inaccuracies arising from the overlap of the average F = I + 1/2 and F = I - 1/2 ground-state Zeeman resonances. We employ density-matrix simulations and experiments to investigate how this hyperfine systematic error varies with spin polarization in a $^{87}$Rb free-induction-decay (FID) magnetometer. At low spin polarizations, ($P \leq 0.5$), this effect causes single-frequency magnetic-field extraction techniques to exhibit inaccuracies up to approximately 3.5 nT. Density-matrix simulations reveal that this bias can be traced to the relative amplitude and phase between the F = I $\pm$ 1/2 hyperfine ground-state manifolds in the FID spin precession signal. We show that this systematic error can be mitigated using either a double-frequency fitting model that accounts for the relative amplitude and phase or synchronous-pulse pumping, that minimizes the F = 1 contribution to the FID signal. Theoretical simulations predict accuracies within 0.5 nT for both techniques across a wide range of spin polarizations, suggesting a sevenfold enhancement over single-frequency extraction methods. Our experiments validate this, showcasing a variation in the extracted field below 1 nT, a 3.5-fold improvement compared to single-frequency extraction methods. Furthermore, the mitigation techniques demonstrate agreement of the extracted magnetic field within 1.5 nT.</description>

      <title>Measurement of microwave polarization using two polarization orthogonal local microwave electric fields in a Rydberg atom-based mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a novel method for measuring the polarization direction of a microwave electric field in a single measurement using a Rydberg atom-based mixer with two orthogonally polarized local microwave electric fields. Furthermore, introducing a weak static magnetic field enables the utilization of the Zeeman effect and exploitation of polarization asymmetry. This distinction allows for determining the polarization direction of the microwave field is{\theta}or180{\deg}-{\theta}within the 0 to 180 degree range. This is the first real-time measurement of microwave polarization within 0 to 180 degrees, crucial for microwave sensing and information transmission.</description>

      <title>Molecular influence on nuclear-quadrupole-coupling effects in laser induced alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the effect of nuclear-quadrupole interactions on the field-free impulsive alignment of different asymmetric-top molecules. Our analysis is focused on the influence of the hyperfine- and rotational-energy-level structures. These depend on the number of nuclear spins, the rotational constants, and the symmetry of the tensors involved in the nuclear spin and external field interactions. Comparing the prototypical large-nuclear-spin molecules iodobenzene, 1,2-diiodobenzene, 1,3-diiodobenzene, and 2,5-diiodobenzonitrile, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the hyperfine splittings compared to the rotational-energy splittings plays a crucial role in the spin-rotational dynamics after the laser pulse. Moreover, we point out that the impact of the quadrupole coupling on the rotational dynamics decreases when highly excited rotational states dominate the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Long-lived metastable-qubit memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent storage of quantum information is crucial to many quantum technologies. Long coherence times have been demonstrated in trapped-ion qubits, typically using the hyperfine levels within the ground state of a single ion. However, recent research suggests qubits encoded in metastable states could provide architectural benefits for quantum information processing, such as the possibility of effective dual-species operation in a single-species system and erasure-error conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate long-lived encoding of a quantum state in the metastable states of a trapped ion. By sympathetically cooling with another ion of the same species and constantly monitoring for erasure errors, we demonstrate a coherence time of 136(42) seconds with a qubit encoded in the metastable $5D_{5/2}$ state of a single $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ion. In agreement with a model based on empirical results from dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy, we find that dephasing of the metastable levels is the dominant source of error once erasure errors are removed.</description>

      <title>Quantum state tracking and control of a single molecular ion in a thermal environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding molecular state evolution is central to many disciplines, including molecular dynamics, precision measurement, and molecule-based quantum technology. Details of the evolution are obscured when observing a statistical ensemble of molecules. Here, we reported real-time observations of thermal radiation-driven transitions between individual states ("jumps") of a single molecule. We reversed these "jumps" through microwave-driven transitions, resulting in a twentyfold improvement in the time the molecule dwells in a chosen state. The measured transition rates showed anisotropy in the thermal environment, pointing to the possibility of using single molecules as in-situ probes for the strengths of ambient fields. Our approaches for state detection and manipulation could apply to a wide range of species, facilitating their uses in fields including quantum science, molecular physics, and ion-neutral chemistry.</description>

      <title>Lattice-induced wavefunction effects on trapped superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavefunction effects in uncorrelated systems are characterized by the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Beyond those, we propose gauge-independent tensors describing Bloch wavefunction effects on local interaction between correlated particles. We derive an effective hydrodynamic theory for ultracold bosons in optical lattices. Ground states and collective modes of superfluids in isotropic harmonic traps are solved for highly symmetric lattices. In a dynamic process, the wavefunction effects are featured by the eigenfrequency, amplitude, and phase shift of an excited breathing mode and can be observed in experiments. We also give a tight-binding model of a bipartite square lattice with nontrivial wavefunction effects, where results are estimated with typical experimental parameters. Our discovery advances the connections between the modern band theory and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>
