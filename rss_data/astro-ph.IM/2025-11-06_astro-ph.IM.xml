      <title>The Exospace Weather Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather is among the most powerful and least understood forces shaping planetary atmospheres. In our Solar System, we observe its effects directly: atmospheric escape, chemical disruption, and spectacular auroral displays. Yet for exoplanets, we lack the tools and data to comprehensively assess the impacts of space weather, especially invisible elements like stellar winds, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and variable interplanetary magnetic fields. This problem lies at the intersection of four key fields: heliophysics, planetary science, astrobiology, and astrophysics. In 2023--2025, experts from these four fields convened at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space Studies to explore pathways for advancing the study of exospace weather. Organizing the subject into five core themes -- planets and their stellar particle environments, stellar magnetism and space weather modeling, quasi-steady stellar winds, transient events, and programmatic pathways -- our team synthesized concepts from across relevant fields and identified a wide array of opportunities for progress. This report is the product of that effort. It assembles cross-disciplinary knowledge; highlights outstanding theoretical challenges; explores promising innovations in observation, modeling, methodology, and instrumentation; and makes recommendations for accelerating community-wide progress. Together, these lay out a path to transforming the challenging, yet tractable problem of exospace weather into a foundational element of our understanding exoplanetary systems, and our own Solar System, in their entirety.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmos: XMM-Newton's Scientific Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In December 2024, the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory celebrated the 25th anniversary of its launch. The annual number of peer-reviewed articles utilising XMM-Newton data has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory over the past two and a half decades, attaining more than 400 in 2022. The annual call for observing time proposals continues to experience a high level of oversubscription, typically ranging from a factor of 6 to 7. In order to enhance the scientific discovery space, XMM-Newton, primarily through the Project Scientist and Science Operations Centre, has pursued a strategy of expansion, which can be grouped into three phases: Large Projects with long observing time (2006-2009), Joint Observations (2011-2016), and Targets of Opportunity (2016-2024), respectively. A salient feature of XMM-Newton's time allocation is the systematic removal of biases from the second call onwards, a strategy that has enabled the attainment of comparable gender success rates and high acceptance rates for young scientists over 25 years, a feat only recently accomplished by similar missions through the introduction of double-anonymous review. XMM-Newton research is conducted by an active community of 4,300 scientists, of which approximately 570 are leading (1st author). The foundation of this community and its research is predicated on XMM-Newton data, with the project's policy of user support and calibration being fundamental constituents, as well as the project's active engagement and communication with its members.</description>

      <title>Secondary standards in the UKIRT faint standard fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present precise J- and K-band photometric measurements for 128 near-infrared secondary standard stars, located in the 19 UKIRT/MKO primary faint standard fields. The data were collected over more than 50 nights, covering a decade of observations between 2008 and 2018 at the ESO La Silla Observatory, using the New Technology Telescope (NTT) equipped with the SOFI NIR camera. Presented magnitudes are calibrated onto the MKO photometric system. The J- and K-band magnitudes range from 10 to 15.8 mag, with median values of $\tilde{J}$ = 13.5 and $\tilde{K}$ = 13 mag. The selection process ensured high photometric quality, with a precision better than 0.01 mag for all stars. The catalog excludes stars with close neighbors, high proper motion, or variable stars. Using these fields for standardization can improve the precision and accuracy of photometric calibrations without increasing the observational time cost.</description>

      <title>Improving the Energy and Angular Resolutions of X-ray Telescopes with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Satellite Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.</description>

      <title>A new broadband atmospheric dispersion corrector for HROS-TMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric dispersion causes light from celestial objects with different wavelengths to refract at varying angles as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. This effect results in an elongated image at the focal plane of a telescope and diminishes fiber coupling efficiency into spectrographs. We propose an optical design that incorporates a Rotational Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (RADC) to address the broadband dispersion encountered in the multi-object mode of the High-Resolution Optical Spectrograph (HROS) on the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The RADC corrects the dispersion across the entire wavelength range (0.31-1 micron), using Amici prisms optimized for over 90% transmission efficiency and minimal angular deviation of the beam from the optical axis after dispersion correction. For enhanced accuracy, particularly in the blue region, we have, for the first time, implemented the Filippenko (1982) model in Zemax via a custom Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of the Fast Data Processing System for the Baikal-GVD Neutrino Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast data processing system for the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope, designed for rapid identification of astrophysical neutrino events. Leveraging Baikal-GVD's modular cluster architecture, the system implements parallelized file processing where raw data files undergo concurrent analysis across dedicated virtual machines. The system implements two pipelines: a fast per-file processing and a fully fledged (per-run) processing, which integrates dynamic detector geometry determined from acoustic and inertial positioning systems and data quality monitoring with a latency of about 27 hr. The fast processing pipeline delivers a total latency of about 1.5-18 minutes from event detection to reconstructed data availability, depending on water luminescence levels. This enables fast follow-up observations of transient astrophysical sources, fulfilling Baikal-GVD's role in multi-messenger networks. The article also highlights key features of the data acquisition system, the integration of advanced synchronization systems and a robust infrastructure for data handling and storage, ensuring efficient and reliable operation of the Baikal-GVD telescope.</description>

      <title>Coherent Differential Imaging of high-contrast extended sources with VLT/SPHERE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging relies on advanced coronagraphs and adaptive optics (AO) to attenuate the starlight. However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.</description>

      <title>The first year of LISA Galactic foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In this manuscript, we employ the $\texttt{bahamas}$ codebase to characterize, in a global-fit fashion, the reconstruction of the Galactic foreground during the first year of observation. To account for its statistical properties, we represent the data in time--frequency domain, and characterize the effectiveness of multiple approaches, e.g. statistically viable likelihoods, sampling schemes, segmentation widths, and gaps density. Our analysis yields consistent results across, with overwhelming evidence in favor of a non-stationary model in less than a month of data. Moreover, we show robustness against the presence of additional extragalactic foregrounds, and test the suitability of our approximations on the more complex simulated data in the $\textit{Yorsh}$ data challenge.</description>

      <title>Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis I: Methodology and implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex inference tasks, such as those encountered in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, rely on Bayesian frameworks. The high-dimensional parameter space and the strong interdependencies among astrophysical, pulsar noise, and nuisance parameters introduce significant challenges for efficient learning and robust inference. These challenges are emblematic of broader issues in decision science, where model over-parameterization and prior sensitivity can compromise both computational tractability and the reliability of the results. We address these issues in the framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling by introducing a reparameterization strategy. Our approach employs Normalizing Flows (NFs) to decorrelate the parameters governing hierarchical priors from those of astrophysical interest. The use of NF-based mappings provides both the flexibility to realize the reparametrization and the tractability to preserve proper probability densities. We further adopt i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to accelerate exploration of complex posteriors. This unified use of NFs improves statistical robustness and computational efficiency, providing a principled methodology for addressing hierarchical Bayesian inference in PTA analysis.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning for Robust Classification of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unknown, population-level analyses can elucidate underlying structure in these signals. In this study, we employ deep learning methods to both classify FRBs and analyze structural patterns in the latent space learned from the first CHIME catalog. We adopt a Supervised Variational Autoencoder (sVAE) architecture which combines the representational learning capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with a supervised classification task, thereby improving both classification performance and the interpretability of the latent space. We construct a learned latent space in which we perform further dimensionality reduction to find underlying structure in the data. Our results demonstrate that the sVAE model achieves high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters and reveals separation between repeater and non-repeater populations. Upon further analysis of the latent space, we observe that dispersion measure excess, spectral index, and spectral running are the dominant features distinguishing repeaters from non-repeaters. We also identify four non-repeating FRBs as repeater candidates, two of which have been independently flagged in previous studies.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing (SL) by galaxy clusters is a powerful probe of their inner mass distribution and a key test bed for cosmological models. However, the detection of SL events in wide-field surveys such as Euclid requires robust, automated methods capable of handling the immense data volume generated. In this work, we present an advanced deep learning (DL) framework based on mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNNs), designed to autonomously detect and segment bright, strongly-lensed arcs in Euclid's multi-band imaging of galaxy clusters. The model is trained on a realistic simulated data set of cluster-scale SL events, constructed by injecting mock background sources into Euclidised Hubble Space Telescope images of 10 massive lensing clusters, exploiting their high-precision mass models constructed with extensive spectroscopic data. The network is trained and validated on over 4500 simulated images, and tested on an independent set of 500 simulations, as well as real Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) observations. The trained network achieves high performance in identifying gravitational arcs in the test set, with a precision and recall of 76% and 58%, respectively, processing 2'x2' images in a fraction of a second. When applied to a sample of visually confirmed Euclid Q1 cluster-scale lenses, our model recovers 66% of gravitational arcs above the area threshold used during training. While the model shows promising results, limitations include the production of some false positives and challenges in detecting smaller, fainter arcs. Our results demonstrate the potential of advanced DL computer vision techniques for efficient and scalable arc detection, enabling the automated analysis of SL systems in current and future wide-field surveys. The code, ARTEMIDE, is open source and will be available at github.com/LBasz/ARTEMIDE.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Magnetic Structures in the Small-Scale Turbulent Dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with polarisation observations.</description>

      <title>Living on the edge. A quantitative warning on boundary artifacts in the IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are a practical necessity in cosmological simulations, but they can also introduce numerical artifacts. We quantified the prevalence of PBC-related artifacts in the IllustrisTNG using dark-matter-deprived galaxies (DMDGs) as tracers. We found that their occurrence scales inversely with simulation volume. We demonstrated that this excess population is spatially correlated with the box edges; the smallest TNG50 box is most affected by these problems. This is a unique and irreplaceable resource for studying galaxy structure. Manual inspection confirmed abrupt, unphysical mass-loss events coincident with boundary crossings. We also highlight the challenge of disentangling numerical artifacts from genuine tidally stripped galaxies in boundary-crossing clusters in TNG100. We conclude by recommending a set of mandatory sanity checks that include positional verification, mass history analysis, and even exclusion of the buffer zone near the edges. These strategies ensure the robustness of the scientific results derived from these invaluable simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency superconducting lumped-element resonators have recently attracted significant attention in the context of axion dark matter searches. Here we present the design and implementation of a fixed-frequency superconducting resonator operating near $250~\mathrm{kHz}$, possessing an inductor volume of $\sim 1$ liter and achieving an unloaded quality factor $Q \approx 2.1\times10^{6}$. This resonator represents a significant improvement over the state of the art and informs the design of searches for low-mass axions.</description>

      <title>3D Full Spectrum Fitting: Algorithm Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full spectrum fitting is the prevailing method for extracting stellar kinematic and population measurements from 1D galaxy spectra. 3D methods refer to analysis of Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data where spatial and spectral dimensions are modelled simultaneously. While several 3D methods exist for modelling gas structures there has been less investigation into the more computationally demanding problem of 3D full spectrum fitting for stellar recoveries. This work introduces and compares two algorithms for this task: the Projected Nesterov Kaczmarz Reconstruction method (PNKR) and a version of the Bayes-LOSVD software which has been modified to account for spatial correlations. We aim to understand strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms and assess the impact of 3D methods for stellar inferences. We apply both recovery algorithms to a mock IFS data over a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range from 20-200 and evaluate the quality of the recoveries compared to the known ground truth. Accounting for spatial correlations in Bayes-LOSVD significantly improved the accuracy and precision of kinematic recoveries. 3D modelling with PNKR did not provide any significant improvement over 1D fits however, for SNR&gt;40, PNKR did recover the most accurate kinematics overall. Additionally, by modelling the joint distribution over kinematics and populations, PNKR could successfully infer trends between these quantities e.g. inferring local metallicity-velocity trends, albeit with a significant bias on the absolute metallicity. Having demonstrated advantages of (i) 3D modelling with Bayes-LOSVD, and (ii) joint kinematic-population analyses with PNKR, we conclude that both methodological advances will prove useful for detecting and characterising stellar structures from IFS data.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection and characterization of random telegraph noise in sCMOS sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) image sensors are a modern alternative to typical CCD detectors and are rapidly gaining popularity in observational astronomy due to their large sizes, low read-out noise, high frame rates, and cheap manufacturing. However, numerous challenges remain in using them due to fundamental differences between CCD and CMOS architectures, especially concerning the pixel-dependent and non-Gaussian nature of their read-out noise. One of the main components of the latter is the random telegraph noise (RTN) caused by the charge traps introduced by the defects close to the oxide-silicon interface in sCMOS image sensors, which manifests itself as discrete jumps in a pixel's output signal, degrading the overall image fidelity. In this work, we present a statistical method to detect and characterize RTN-affected pixels using a series of dark frames. Identifying RTN contaminated pixels enables post-processing strategies that mitigate their impact and the development of manufacturing quality metrics.</description>

Abstract: The LiteBIRD satellite mission aims at detecting Cosmic Microwave Background $B$ modes with unprecedented precision, targeting a total error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of $\delta r \sim 0.001$. Operating from the L2 Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, LiteBIRD will survey the full sky across 15 frequency bands (34 to 448 GHz) for 3 years.The current LiteBIRD baseline configuration employs 4508 detectors sampling at 19.1 Hz to achieve an effective polarization sensitivity of $ 2 \mu\mathrm{K-arcmin}$ and an angular resolution of 31 arcmin (at 140 GHz).We describe the first release of the official LiteBIRD simulations, realized with a new simulation pipeline developed using the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework, see https://github.com/litebird/litebird_sim . This pipeline generates 500 full-sky simulated maps at a Healpix resolution of nside=512. The simulations include also one year of Time Ordered Data for approximately one-third of LiteBIRD's total detectors.</description>

      <title>Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.
  The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.
  Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>An efficient spectral Poisson solver for the nirvana-III code: the shearing-box case with vertical vacuum boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Capturing Turbulence with Numerical Dissipation: a Simple Dynamical Model for Unresolved Turbulence in Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and nonthermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity, regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple nontrivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations, as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.</description>

      <title>Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</title>

Abstract: Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE), and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables a bidirectional mapping between the cosmological parameters and the acoustic peak features of $D_\ell^{\rm TT}$. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves sub-percent accuracy over multipoles $\ell \leq 4050$, while PolyCAMB-peak also attains comparable precision and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>
