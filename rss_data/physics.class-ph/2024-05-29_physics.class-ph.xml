      <title>Simulation of Single-Phase Natural Circulation within the BEPU Framework: Sketching Scaling Uncertainty Principle by Multi-Scale CFD Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to enhance safety, nuclear reactors in the design phase consider natural circulation as a mean to remove residual power. The simulation of this passive mechanism must be qualified between the validation range and the scope of utilization (reactor case), introducing potential physical and numerical distortion effects. In this study, we simulate the flow of liquid sodium using the TrioCFD code, employing both higher-fidelity (HF) LES and lower-fidelity (LF) URANS models. We tackle respectively numerical uncertainties through the Grid Convergence Index method, and physical modelling uncertainties through the Polynomial Chaos Expansion method available on the URANIE platform. HF simulations are shown to exhibit a strong resilience to physical distortion effects, with numerical uncertainties being intricately correlated. Conversely, the LF approach, the only one applicable at the reactor scale, is likely to present a reduced predictability. If so, the HF approach should be effective in pinpointing the LF weaknesses: the concept of scaling uncertainty is inline introduced as the growth of the LF simulation uncertainty associated with distortion effects. Thus, the paper outlines that a specific methodology within the BEPU framework - leveraging both HF and LF approaches - could pragmatically enable correlating distortion effects with scaling uncertainty, thereby providing a metric principle.</description>

      <title>Lagrange's planetary equations with time-dependent secular perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-term evolution of astrophysical systems is driven by a Hamiltonian that is independent of the fast angle. As this Hamiltonian may contain explicitly time-dependent parameters, the conservation of mechanical energy is not guaranteed in such systems. We derive how the semi-major axis evolves in these cases. We analyze two astrophysically interesting examples, those of the harmonic and quadrupole perturbations.</description>

      <title>Dispersion and absorption effects in the linearized Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics under an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of the Ohmic and magnetic density currents are investigated in the linearized Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics. The linearization is introduced through an external magnetic field, in which the vector potential of the Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics is expanded around of a magnetic background field, that we consider uniform and constant in this paper. From the Euler-Heisenberg linearized equations, we obtain the solutions for the refractive index associated with the electromagnetic wave superposition, when the current density is ruled by the Ohm law, and in the second case, when the current density is set by a isotropic magnetic conductivity. These solutions are functions of the magnetic background $({\bf B})$, of the wave propagation direction $({\bf k})$, it also depends on the conductivity, and on the wave frequency. As consequence, the dispersion and the absorption of plane waves change when ${\bf B}$ is parallel to ${\bf k}$ in relation to the case of ${\bf B}$ perpendicular to ${\bf k}$ in the medium. The characteristics of the refraction index related to directions of ${\bf B}$ and of the wave polarization open a discussion for the birefringence in this medium.</description>
