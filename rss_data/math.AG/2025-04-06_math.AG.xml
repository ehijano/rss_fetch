      <title>Gopakumar-Vafa invariants associated to cAn singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) invariants associated to cAn singularities. We (1) generalize GV invariants to crepant partial resolutions of cAn singularities, (2) show that generalized GV invariants also satisfy Toda's formula and are determined by their associated contraction algebra, (3) give filtration structures on the parameter space of contraction algebras associated to cAn crepant resolutions with respect to generalized GV invariants, and (4) numerically constrain the possible tuples of GV invariants that can arise. We further give all the tuples that arise from GV invariants of cA2 crepant resolutions.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Compact Calabi--Yau Conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact normal K\"ahler space whose canonical sheaf is a rank-one free $\mathcal O_X$ module and whose singularities are isolated, rational and quasi-homogeneous. We prove then that the obstruction to deforming $X$ concentrates upon its singularities, generalizing partially the results of Namikawa--Gross. We prove also that the locally trivial deformations of $X$ are unobstructed.</description>

      <title>On a Nash curve selection lemma through finitely many points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated theorem in Real Algebraic and Analytic Geometry (originally due to Bruhat-Cartan and Wallace and stated later in its current form by Milnor) is the (Nash) curve selection lemma. It states that each point in the closure of a semialgebraic set ${\mathcal S}\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ can be reached by a Nash arc of ${\mathbb R}^n$ such that at least one of its branches is contained in ${\mathcal S}$.
  The purpose of this work is to generalize the previous result to finitely many points. More precisely, let ${\mathcal S}\subset\R^n$ be a semialgebraic set, let $x_1,\ldots,x_r\in{\mathcal S}$ be $r$ points (that we call `control points') and $0=:t_1&lt;\ldots&lt;t_r:=1$ be $r$ values (that we call `control times'). A natural `logistic' question concerns the existence of a smooth and semialgebraic (Nash) path $\alpha:[0,1]\to{\mathcal S}$ that passes through the control points at the control times, that is, $\alpha(t_k)=x_k$ for $k=1,\ldots,r$. The necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the existence of $\alpha$ when the number of control points is large enough and they are in general position is that $\Ss$ is connected by analytic paths. The existence of generic real algebraic sets that do not contain rational curves confirms that the analogous result involving polynomial paths (instead of Nash paths) is only possible under additional restrictions. A sufficient condition is that $\Ss\subset\R^n$ has in addition dimension $n$.
  A related problem concerns the approximation by a Nash path of an existing continuous semialgebraic path $\beta:[0,1]\to{\mathcal S}$ with control points $x_1,\ldots,x_r\in\Ss$ and control times $0=:t_1&lt;\ldots&lt;t_r:=1$. A sufficient condition is that the (finite) set of values $\eta(\beta)$ at which $\beta$ is not smooth is contained in the set of regular points of ${\mathcal S}$ and $\eta(\beta)$ does not meet the set of control times.</description>

      <title>A vector bundle approach to Nash equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use vector bundles to study the locus of totally mixed Nash equilibria of an $n$-player game in normal form, which we call Nash equilibrium scheme. When the payoff tensor format is balanced, we study the Nash discriminant variety, i.e., the algebraic variety of games whose Nash equilibrium scheme is nonreduced or has a positive dimensional component. We prove that this variety has codimension one. We classify all components of the Nash equilibrium scheme of binary three-player games. We prove that if the payoff tensor is of boundary format, then the Nash discriminant variety has two components: an irreducible hypersurface and a larger-codimensional component. A generic game with an unbalanced payoff tensor format does not admit totally mixed Nash equilibria. We define the Nash resultant variety of games admitting a positive number of totally mixed Nash equilibria. We prove that it is irreducible and determine its codimension and degree.</description>

      <title>Bergman spaces on algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Wiegerinck asserts that the Bergman space of an open subset of the complex numbers is either infinite-dimensional or trivial. Recently, this has been generalized to holomorphic vector bundles over the projective line by the third author and later to vector bundles over any compact Riemann surface by Gallagher, Gupta and Vivas.
  In the present paper we extend the above results to the case of certain singular metrics associated to divisors on a Riemann surface. As corollaries we obtain versions of Wiegerinck's theorem for both projective and affine algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert coefficients is in ${\sf AM}\cap {\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schubert vanishing problem is a central decision problem in algebraic combinatorics and Schubert calculus, with applications to representation theory and enumerative algebraic geometry. The problem has been studied for over 50 years in different settings, with much progress given in the last two decades.
  We prove that the Schubert vanishing problem is in ${\sf AM}$ assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This complements our earlier result in arXiv:2412.02064, that the problem is in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, this implies that the Schubert vanishing problem is unlikely to be ${\sf coNP}$-hard, as we previously conjectured in arXiv:2412.02064.
  The proof is of independent interest as we formalize and expand the notion of a lifted formulation partly inspired by algebraic computations of Schubert problems, and extended formulations of linear programs. We use a result by Mahajan--Vinay to show that the determinant has a lifted formulation of polynomial size. We combine this with Purbhoo's algebraic criterion to derive the result.</description>

      <title>Polarization algebras and the geometry of commuting varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a reduced version of the Chevalley restriction conjecture on the commuting scheme posed by T.H. Chen and B.C. Ng\^o, extending the results of Hunziker for classical groups. In particular, we prove that for any connected reductive group, the ring of $G$-invariant functions on the commuting variety restricts to an isomorphism with the invariants of the d-fold product of a Cartan subalgebra under the Weyl group $k[\mathfrak{t}^d]^W$. The full conjecture implies that this isomorphism extends to the ring of $G$-invariants on the non-reduced commuting scheme, $k[\mathfrak{C}_{\mathfrak{g}}^d]^G$ (hence the invariant ring is nilpotent free). We then prove an analogous restriction theorem for general polar representations which we apply to resolve an important case of a conjecture posed by Bulois, C Lehn, M Lehn and Terpereau about symplectic reductions of $\theta$-representations. Throughout this work, we focus on the connection between the invariant subring generated by polarizations and commutativity.</description>

      <title>Further results on Artin approximation, for group-actions on mapping-germs Maps(X,Y) and for quivers of maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider (analytic, resp. algebraic) map-germs, Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)). These germs are traditionally studied up to the right, let-right and contact equivalences. Below G is one of these groups. An important tool in this study is the Artin approximation: any formal G-equivalence of maps is approximated by ordinary (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic) G-equivalence. We consider maps of (analytic, resp. algebraic) scheme-germs, with arbitrary singularities, Maps(X,Y), and establish stronger versions of this property (for G): the Strong Artin approximation and the P\l oski approximation. As a preliminary step we study the contact equivalence for maps with singular targets.
  In many cases one works with multi-germs of spaces, and with their ``muti-maps". More generally, ``quivers of map-germs" occur in various applications. The needed tools are the Strong Artin approximation for quivers and the P\l oski version. We establish these for directed rooted trees.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Geometry Approach to Viewing Graph Solvability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of viewing graph solvability has gained significant interest in the context of structure-from-motion. A viewing graph is a mathematical structure where nodes are associated to cameras and edges represent the epipolar geometry connecting overlapping views. Solvability studies under which conditions the cameras are uniquely determined by the graph. In this paper we propose a novel framework for analyzing solvability problems based on Algebraic Geometry, demonstrating its potential in understanding structure-from-motion graphs and proving a conjecture that was previously proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.06162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that an algebraic stack with affine stabilizers over an arbitrary base is \'etale-locally a quotient stack around any point with a linearly reductive stabilizer. This generalizes earlier work by the authors of this article (stacks over algebraically closed fields) and by Abramovich, Olsson and Vistoli (stacks with finite inertia). In addition, we prove a number of foundational results, which are new even over a field. These include various coherent completeness and effectivity results for adic sequences of algebraic stacks. Finally, we give several applications of our results and methods, such as structure theorems for linearly reductive group schemes and generalizations to the relative setting of Sumihiro's theorem on torus actions and Luna's \'etale slice theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop canonical bundle formulas for fibrations of relative dimension one in characteristic $p&gt;0$. For such a fibration from a log pair $f\colon (X, \Delta) \to S$, if $f$ is separable, we can obtain a formula similar to the one due to Witaszek \cite{Wit21}; if $f$ is inseparable, we treat the case when $S$ is of maximal Albanese dimension. As an application, we prove that for a klt pair $(X,\Delta)$ with $-(K_X+\Delta)$ nef, if the Albanese morphism $a_X\colon X \to A$ is of relative dimension one, then $X$ is a fiber space over $A$.</description>

      <title>Results on left-right approximation for algebraic morphisms and for analytic morphisms of weakly finite singularity type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Artin approximation (AP) reads: any formal solution of a system of (analytic, resp. algebraic) equations of implicit function type is approximated by ``ordinary" solutions (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic). Morphisms of scheme-germs, e.g. Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)) are usually studied up to the left-right equivalence. The natural question is the left-right version of Artin approximation: when is the formal left-right equivalence of morphisms approximated by the ``ordinary" (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic) equivalence? In this case the standard Artin approximation is not directly applicable, as the involved (functional) equations are not of implicit function type. Moreover, the na\"ive extension does not hold in the analytic case, because of Osgood-Gabrielov-Shiota examples. The left-right version of Artin approximation (LRAP) was established by M. Shiota for morphisms that are either Nash or [real-analytic and of finite singularity type]. We establish LRAP and its stronger version of P\l oski (LRAPP) for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are analytic/algebraic germs of schemes of any characteristic. More precisely: * LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P\l oski's version) hold for algebraic morphisms and for finite analytic morphisms. * LRAP holds for analytic morphisms of weakly-finite singularity type. (For char&gt;0 we impose certain integrability condition.)
  This latter class of morphisms of ``weakly-finite singularity type" (which we introduce) is of separate importance. It extends naturally the traditional class of morphisms of ``finite singularity type", while preserving their non-pathological behavior. The definition goes via the higher critical loci and higher discriminants of morphisms with singular targets.
  We establish basic properties of these critical loci. In particular: any map is finitely (right) determined by its higher critical loci.</description>

Abstract: Reduced power series in two variables with coefficients in a field of characteristic zero satisfy a well-known formula that relates a codimension related to the normalization of a ring and the jacobian ideal. In the general case Deligne proved that this formula is only an inequality; Garc\'ia Barroso and P{\l}oski stated a conjecture for irreducible power series. In this work we generalize Kouchnirenko's formula for any degenerated power series and also generalize Garc\'ia Barroso and P{\l}oski's conjecture. We prove the conjecture in some cases using in particular Greuel and Nguyen.</description>

Abstract: Any sheaf theory on schemes extends canonically to Artin stacks via a procedure called lisse extension. In this paper we show that lisse extension preserves the formalism of Grothendieck's six operations: more precisely, the lisse extension of a weave on schemes determines a weave on (higher) Artin stacks. The setup is general enough to apply to the stable motivic homotopy category with the six functor formalism of Voevodsky-Ayoub-Cisinski-Deglise, for instance, and is not specific to algebraic geometry: for example, it also applies to sheaves of spectra on topological stacks.</description>

Abstract: We consider projective Hyper-K\"ahler manifolds of dimension four that are deformation equivalent to Hilbert squares of K3 surfaces. In case such a manifold admits a divisorial contraction, the exceptional divisor is a conic bundle over a K3 surface. A classification of lattice embeddings implies that there are five types of such conic bundles. In case the manifold has Picard rank two and has two (birational) divisorial contractions we determine the types of these conic bundles. There are exactly seven cases. For the Fano varieties of cubic fourfolds there are only four cases and we provide examples of these.</description>

      <title>Slopes and weights of $\ell$-adic cohomology of rigid spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Frobenius eigenvalues of $\ell$-adic cohomology and $\ell$-adic intersection cohomology of rigid spaces over $p$-adic local fields are algebraic integers and we give bounds for their $p$-adic valuations. As an application, we deduce bounds for their weights, proving conjectures of Bhatt, Hansen, and Zavyalov. We also give examples of monodromy-pure perverse sheaves on projective curves with non monodromy-pure cohomology, answering a question of Hansen and Zavyalov.</description>

      <title>Discriminants and motivic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study invariants of a plane cuve singularity $(f,0)$ coming from motivic integration on symmetric powers of a formal deformation of $f$. We show that a natural discriminant integral recovers the motivic classes of the principal Hilbert schemes of points on $f$, while the orbifold integral gives the plethystic exponential of the motivic Igusa zeta function of $f$. The latter result also holds in higher dimemsions.
  Combined with results of Gorsky and N\'emethi we obtain an interpretation of the discriminant integrals in terms of knot Floer homology, which is reminiscent of the relation between the cohomology of contact loci and fixed point Floer homology proven by de la Bodega and Poza.</description>

      <title>From K\"ahler Ricci solitons to Calabi-Yau K\"ahler cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $X$ is a smooth Fano manifold which caries a K\"ahler Ricci soliton, then the canonical cone of the product of $X$ with a complex projective space of sufficiently large dimension is a Calabi--Yau cone. This can be seen as an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Mabuchi and Nikagawa. This result is obtained by the openness of the set of weight functions $v$ over the momentum polytope of a given smooth Fano manifold, for which a $v$-soliton exists. We discuss other ramifications of this approach, including a Licherowicz type obstruction to the existence of a K\"ahler Ricci soliton and a Fujita type volume bound for the existence of a $v$-soliton.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of Tritronqu\'{e}es Solutions of the Deformed Painlev\'{e} I Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the formal $\hbar$-power series solution of the deformed Painlev\'{e} I equation is resurgent, which means it is generically Borel summable and its Borel transform admits endless analytic continuation. In particular, we find that the Borel transform defines a global multivalued holomorphic function on a singular algebraic surface isomorphic to the Fermat quintic surface $x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 0$ modulo an involution. This surface is an algebraic fibration over the complex plane of the differential equation with generic fibre a smooth quintic curve. Each fibre is equipped with a fivefold covering map over another complex plane (the Borel plane) with ten ramification points (the Borel singularities) spread equally over two branch points giving two opposite Stokes rays.</description>
