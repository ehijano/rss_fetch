      <title>Alteration of the Brains Microbiome and Neuroinflammation Associated with Ventricular Catheters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objectives: Proximal catheter obstruction is the leading cause of ventriculoperitoneal shunt failure, yet the biological triggers of peri-catheter inflammation and tissue ingrowth remain poorly defined. Evidence of bacterial ribosomal RNA in human brain tissue suggests that low-biomass microbial exposure may influence the inflammatory microenvironment surrounding implants. This study examined if microbial signal is detectable in unaltered brain tissue and if catheter implantation produces microbial shifts relevant to shunt dysfunction. Methods: Twenty-nine female mice were assigned to unaltered control (UC), trauma control (TC), plain silicone catheter (PSC), or antibiotic-impregnated catheter (AIC) groups. Brain and cecum tissues were harvested at postoperative days 7 and 28 for 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbial composition and predicted functional pathways were analyzed. A separate cohort underwent longitudinal MRI to assess edema, glial scar formation, and macrophage-associated susceptibility signal. Results: Low-level microbial signal was detected in unaltered brain tissue. Catheter implantation induced material-dependent shifts in brain-associated microbial composition. PSC was associated with enrichment of pro-inflammatory taxa, whereas AIC favored immune-regulatory taxa. Predicted short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis was highest in AIC and lowest in PSC, while predicted lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis trended higher in PSC. MRI showed similar edema resolution but higher macrophage-associated susceptibility signal in PSC animals. Conclusion: Intracranial catheter implantation produces material-dependent shifts in low-biomass brain-associated microbial signal that parallel differential neuroimmune activation. These findings suggest catheter material may shape a biologically relevant peri-catheter niche with implications for chronic gliosis and proximal shunt obstruction.</description>

      <title>MetaHQ: Harmonized, high-quality metadata annotations of public omics samples and studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public omics databases like the Gene Expression Omnibus and the Sequence Read Archive offer substantial opportunities for data reuse to address novel biomedical questions. However, it is still difficult to find samples and studies of interest since they are described by free-text metadata and lack standardized annotations. To address this issue, multiple research groups have undertaken curation efforts to add standardized annotations to large collections of these data, but these annotations are fragmented across online resources and are stored in different formats subject to varying standardization criteria, hindering the integration of annotations across sources. We developed MetaHQ to harmonize and distribute standardized metadata for public omics samples. MetaHQ comprises a database with nearly 200,000 annotations from 13 sources and a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) to query the database and retrieve annotations. The MetaHQ CLI is deployed as a Python Package on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/metahq-cli that accesses the MetaHQ database available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18462463. Project source code and documentation are available at https://github.com/krishnanlab/meta-hq.</description>

      <title>ClusterChirp: A GPU-accelerated Web Server for Natural Language-Guided Interactive Visualization and Analysis of Large Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular datasets are commonly visualized as heatmaps, where data values are represented as color intensities in a matrix to reveal patterns and correlations. However, modern omics technologies increasingly generate matrices so large that existing visual exploration tools require downsampling or filtering, risking loss of biologically important patterns. Additional barriers arise from tools that require command-line expertise, or fragmented workflows for downstream biological interpretation. We present ClusterChirp, a web-based platform for real-time, interactive exploration of large-scale data matrices enabled by GPU-accelerated rendering and parallelized hierarchical clustering using multiple CPU cores. Built on deck.gl and multi-threaded clustering algorithms, ClusterChirp supports on-the-fly clustering, multi-metric sorting, feature search, and adjustable visualization parameters for interactive explorations. Uniquely, a natural language interface powered by a Large Language Model helps users perform complex operations and build reproducible workflows from conversational commands. Furthermore, users can select clusters to explore interactive within-cluster correlation networks in 2D or 3D, or perform functional enrichment through biological knowledge bases. Developed with iterative user feedback and adhering to FAIR4S principles, ClusterChirp empowers researchers to extract insights from high-dimensional omics data with unprecedented ease and speed.

      <title>Bipartite Graph Attention-based Clustering for Large-scale scRNA-seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: scRNA-seq clustering is a critical task for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, as it groups cells with similar gene expression profiles. Transformers, as powerful foundational models, have been applied to scRNA-seq clustering. Their self-attention mechanism automatically assigns higher attention weights to cells within the same cluster, enhancing the distinction between clusters. Existing methods for scRNA-seq clustering, such as graph transformer-based models, treat each cell as a token in a sequence. Their computational and space complexities are $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with respect to the number of cells, limiting their applicability to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.To address this challenge, we propose a Bipartite Graph Transformer-based clustering model (BGFormer) for scRNA-seq data. We introduce a set of learnable anchor tokens as shared reference points to represent the entire dataset. A bipartite graph attention mechanism is introduced to learn the similarity between cells and anchor tokens, bringing cells of the same class closer together in the embedding space. BGFormer achieves linear computational complexity with respect to the number of cells, making it scalable to large datasets. Experimental results on multiple large-scale scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of BGFormer.</description>

      <title>GRIT: Graph-Regularized Logit Refinement for Zero-shot Cell Type Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a principled inference-time paradigm for zero-shot cell type annotation (GRIT) which bridges the scalability of pre-trained foundation models with the structural robustness relied upon in human expert annotation workflows. Specifically, we enforce local consistency of the zero-shot CLIP logits over the task-specific PCA-based $k$-NN graph. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000 single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy, achieving accuracy gains of up to 10\%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for enhancing zero-shot cell type annotation.</description>

      <title>DNACHUNKER: Learnable Tokenization for DNA Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA language models are increasingly used to represent genomic sequence, yet their effectiveness depends critically on how raw nucleotides are converted into model inputs. Unlike natural language, DNA offers no canonical boundaries, making fixed tokenizations a brittle design choice under shifts, indels, and local repeats. We introduce \modelname{}, a masked DNA language model that incorporates a learnable adaptive segmentation module to produce context-dependent, variable-length units. Building on a dynamic segmentation procedure, \modelname{} learns to allocate finer granularity to functionally enriched regions while compressing repetitive or redundant sequence. We pre-train \modelname{} on the human reference genome (HG38) and evaluate it on the Nucleotide Transformer and Genomic Benchmarks, where it consistently improves over strong fixed-tokenization baselines. Further analyses and ablations indicate that the learned segmentation is structured rather than incidental: the model preferentially uses shorter units around promoters and exons, and longer units in repetitive regions, yielding representations that are both mutation-resilient and biologically-informed.</description>

      <title>Y-Trim: Evidence-gated Adaptase tail trimming for single-stranded bisulfite sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Single-stranded whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (ssWGBS) enables DNA methylation profiling in low-input and highly fragmented material, including cell-free DNA. In widely used post-bisulfite protocols, Adaptase-mediated tailing adds stochastic, template-free end sequence. Unlike adapter-defined junctions, these tails lack a fixed sequence template, so trimming must be decided from FASTQ-stage observables under intrinsic uncertainty.
  Results: We show that bisulfite-induced compositional degeneracy implies a strictly positive error floor for any fixed per-read boundary rule under a finite nucleotide alphabet. Guided by this limit, we introduce Y-Trim, an evidence-gated framework that separates admission (should we trim) from inference (where to trim). For Read 2, Y-Trim performs per-read adaptive cut placement via a fixed, chemistry-typed matrix-linear texture scoring scheme; for Read 1, it uses automated sample-level anchoring when read-level localization is feasibility-limited. Across modules, Y-Trim is an explicit, chemistry-specific decision rule with interpretable operating points. On a curated 34-run public cohort (CCGB-34) and simulator stress tests with known latent boundaries, Y-Trim exhibits stable Read 2 operating behavior and Read 1 feasibility-limited behavior consistent with conditional read-through.
  Conclusions: Template-free Adaptase tail trimming is best viewed as an evidence-limited FASTQ-stage decision rather than a generic preprocessing knob. By making admissibility and abstention explicit and exposing interpretable genomic-retention versus residual-carryover trade-offs, Y-Trim provides a practical uncertainty-aware preprocessing strategy for ssWGBS.</description>
