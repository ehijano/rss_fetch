      <title>Analyzing Customer-Facing Vendor Experiences with Time Series Forecasting and Monte Carlo Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: eBay partners with external vendors, which allows customers to freely select a vendor to complete their eBay experiences. However, vendor outages can hinder customer experiences. Consequently, eBay can disable a problematic vendor to prevent customer loss. Disabling the vendor too late risks losing customers willing to switch to other vendors, while disabling it too early risks losing those unwilling to switch. In this paper, we propose a data-driven solution to answer whether eBay should disable a problematic vendor and when to disable it. Our solution involves forecasting customer behavior. First, we use a multiplicative seasonality model to represent behavior if all vendors are fully functioning. Next, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to represent behavior if the problematic vendor remains enabled. Finally, we use a linear model to represent behavior if the vendor is disabled. By comparing these forecasts, we determine the optimal time for eBay to disable the problematic vendor.</description>

      <title>Supervised brain node and network construction under voxel-level functional imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in understanding the brain's functional organization related to behavior have been pivotal, particularly in the development of predictive models based on brain connectivity. Traditional methods in this domain often involve a two-step process by first constructing a connectivity matrix from predefined brain regions, and then linking these connections to behaviors or clinical outcomes. However, these approaches with unsupervised node partitions predict outcomes inefficiently with independently established connectivity. In this paper, we introduce the Supervised Brain Parcellation (SBP), a brain node parcellation scheme informed by the downstream predictive task. With voxel-level functional time courses generated under resting-state or cognitive tasks as input, our approach clusters voxels into nodes in a manner that maximizes the correlation between inter-node connections and the behavioral outcome, while also accommodating intra-node homogeneity. We rigorously evaluate the SBP approach using resting-state and task-based fMRI data from both the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our analyses show that SBP significantly improves out-of-sample connectome-based predictive performance compared to conventional step-wise methods under various brain atlases. This advancement holds promise for enhancing our understanding of brain functional architectures with behavior and establishing more informative network neuromarkers for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Gibbs sampling, exact sampling, and distribution function evaluation for the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized inverse Gaussian, denoted $\mathrm{GIG}(p, a, b)$, is a flexible family of distributions that includes the gamma, inverse gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions as special cases. In addition to its applications in statistical modeling and its theoretical interest, the GIG often arises in computational statistics, especially in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for posterior inference. This article introduces two mixture representations for the GIG: one that expresses the distribution as a continuous mixture of inverse Gaussians and another that reveals a recursive relationship between GIGs with different values of $p$. The former representation forms the basis for a data augmentation scheme that leads to a geometrically ergodic Gibbs sampler for the GIG. This simple Gibbs sampler, which alternates between gamma and inverse Gaussian conditional distributions, can be incorporated within an encompassing MCMC algorithm when simulation from a GIG is required. The latter representation leads to algorithms for exact, rejection-free sampling as well as CDF evaluation for the GIG with half-integer $p.$ We highlight computational examples from the literature where these new algorithms could be applied.</description>

      <title>Population Power Curves in ASCA with Permutation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Power Curves in ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) based on permutation testing, and introduce the Population Curves derived from population parameters describing the relative effect among factors and interactions. We distinguish Relative from Absolute Population Curves, where the former represent statistical power in terms of the normalized effect size between structure and noise, and the latter in terms of the sample size. Relative Population Curves are useful to find the optimal ASCA model (e.g., fixed/random factors, crossed/nested relationships, interactions, the test statistic, transformations, etc.) for the analysis of an experimental design at hand. Absolute Population Curves are useful to determine the sample size and the optimal number of levels for each factor during the planning phase on an experiment. We illustrate both types of curves through simulation. We expect Population Curves to become the go-to approach to plan the optimal analysis pipeline and the required sample size in an omics study analyzed with ASCA.</description>
