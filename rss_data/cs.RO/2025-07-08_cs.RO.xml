      <title>Closed-Form Robustness Bounds for Second-Order Pruning of Neural Controller Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear. We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz. Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$, producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$ and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state $s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases, and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Personalised Explanations in Long-term Human-Robot Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only when there is related user knowledge.</description>

      <title>Image-driven Robot Drawing with Rapid Lognormal Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG) renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.</description>

      <title>Dexterous Teleoperation of 20-DoF ByteDexter Hand via Human Motion Retargeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replicating human--level dexterity remains a fundamental robotics challenge, requiring integrated solutions from mechatronic design to the control of high degree--of--freedom (DoF) robotic hands. While imitation learning shows promise in transferring human dexterity to robots, the efficacy of trained policies relies on the quality of human demonstration data. We bridge this gap with a hand--arm teleoperation system featuring: (1) a 20--DoF linkage--driven anthropomorphic robotic hand for biomimetic dexterity, and (2) an optimization--based motion retargeting for real--time, high--fidelity reproduction of intricate human hand motions and seamless hand--arm coordination. We validate the system via extensive empirical evaluations, including dexterous in-hand manipulation tasks and a long--horizon task requiring the organization of a cluttered makeup table randomly populated with nine objects. Experimental results demonstrate its intuitive teleoperation interface with real--time control and the ability to generate high--quality demonstration data.

      <title>Robust and Efficient Embedded Convex Optimization through First-Order Adaptive Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks, achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2) complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.</description>

      <title>Label-Free Long-Horizon 3D UAV Trajectory Prediction via Motion-Aligned RGB and Event Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for airspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction, reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance to support reproducible research in the robotics community.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of an Uncertainty-Aware Late Fusion Algorithm for Multi-Source Bird's Eye View Detections Under Controlled Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable multi-source fusion is crucial for robust perception in autonomous systems. However, evaluating fusion performance independently of detection errors remains challenging. This work introduces a systematic evaluation framework that injects controlled noise into ground-truth bounding boxes to isolate the fusion process. We then propose Unified Kalman Fusion (UniKF), a late-fusion algorithm based on Kalman filtering to merge Bird's Eye View (BEV) detections while handling synchronization issues. Experiments show that UniKF outperforms baseline methods across various noise levels, achieving up to 3x lower object's positioning and orientation errors and 2x lower dimension estimation errors, while maintaining nearperfect precision and recall between 99.5% and 100%.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot Aerial Soft Manipulator For Floating Litter Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments, demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation. Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic environments.</description>

      <title>Coil Geometry Learning for Short-Range Magnetic Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly, resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems, including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However, proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions, we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.</description>

      <title>DK-RRT: Deep Koopman RRT for Collision-Aware Motion Planning of Space Manipulators in Dynamic Debris Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning for robotic manipulators operating in dynamic orbital debris environments poses significant challenges due to complex obstacle movements and uncertainties. This paper presents Deep Koopman RRT (DK-RRT), an advanced collision-aware motion planning framework integrating deep learning with Koopman operator theory and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). DK-RRT leverages deep neural networks to identify efficient nonlinear embeddings of debris dynamics, enhancing Koopman-based predictions and enabling accurate, proactive planning in real-time. By continuously refining predictive models through online sensor feedback, DK-RRT effectively navigates the manipulator through evolving obstacle fields. Simulation studies demonstrate DK-RRT's superior performance in terms of adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to traditional RRT and conventional Koopman-based planning, highlighting its potential for autonomous space manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Accurate Pose Estimation Using Contact Manifold Sampling for Safe Peg-in-Hole Insertion of Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic assembly of complex, non-convex geometries with tight clearances remains a challenging problem, demanding precise state estimation for successful insertion. In this work, we propose a novel framework that relies solely on contact states to estimate the full SE(3) pose of a peg relative to a hole. Our method constructs an online submanifold of contact states through primitive motions with just 6 seconds of online execution, subsequently mapping it to an offline contact manifold for precise pose estimation. We demonstrate that without such state estimation, robots risk jamming and excessive force application, potentially causing damage. We evaluate our approach on five industrially relevant, complex geometries with 0.1 to 1.0 mm clearances, achieving a 96.7% success rate - a 6x improvement over primitive-based insertion without state estimation. Additionally, we analyze insertion forces, and overall insertion times, showing our method significantly reduces the average wrench, enabling safer and more efficient assembly.</description>

      <title>RwoR: Generating Robot Demonstrations from Human Hand Collection for Policy Learning without Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03930v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning have shown promising results in robotic manipulation, driven by the availability of high-quality training data. To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use human hand demonstrations to obtain training data. However, the former requires both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand demonstrations and the deployed robot observations. To address this, we propose a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap. Specifically, a GoPro fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand demonstrations. We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both timestamps and observations. Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation pipeline for training robotic policy model. In experiments, the robust manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data collection method.

      <title>Robust and Modular Multi-Limb Synchronization in Motion Stack for Space Robots with Trajectory Clamping via Hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular robotics holds immense potential for space exploration, where reliability, repairability, and reusability are critical for cost-effective missions. Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control, deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination (available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs, evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Scalable Learning of High-Dimensional Demonstrations with Composition of Linear Parameter Varying Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques enable robots to learn and generalize tasks from user demonstrations, eliminating the need for coding expertise among end-users. One established technique to implement LfD in robots is to encode demonstrations in a stable Dynamical System (DS). However, finding a stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on the number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant computational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as floating-point errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel compositional approach that enhances the applicability and scalability of learning stable DSs with BMIs.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-LIC2: LiDAR-Inertial-Camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM system with 3D Gaussian Splatting, which is the first to jointly consider visual quality, geometric accuracy, and real-time performance. It robustly and accurately estimates poses while building a photo-realistic 3D Gaussian map in real time that enables high-quality novel view RGB and depth rendering. To effectively address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas, significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our system across LiDAR sensors with varying sampling densities. Both the dataset and code will be made publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.</description>

      <title>Generalized Locomotion in Out-of-distribution Conditions with Robust Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To succeed in the real world, robots must deal with situations that differ from those seen during training. Those out-of-distribution situations for legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT),a variation of transformer,could achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy's robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally, despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging corruption noise during testing.</description>

      <title>Are Learning-Based Approaches Ready for Real-World Indoor Navigation? A Case for Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional indoor robot navigation methods provide a reliable solution when adapted to constrained scenarios, but lack flexibility or require manual re-tuning when deployed in more complex settings. In contrast, learning-based approaches learn directly from sensor data and environmental interactions, enabling easier adaptability. While significant work has been presented in the context of learning navigation policies, learning-based methods are rarely compared to traditional navigation methods directly, which is a problem for their ultimate acceptance in general navigation contexts. In this work, we explore the viability of imitation learning (IL) for indoor navigation, using expert (joystick) demonstrations to train various navigation policy networks based on RGB images, LiDAR, and a combination of both, and we compare our IL approach to a traditional potential field-based navigation method. We evaluate the approach on a physical mobile robot platform equipped with a 2D LiDAR and a camera in an indoor university environment. Our multimodal model demonstrates superior navigation capabilities in most scenarios, but faces challenges in dynamic environments, likely due to limited diversity in the demonstrations. Nevertheless, the ability to learn directly from data and generalise across layouts suggests that IL can be a practical navigation approach, and potentially a useful initialisation strategy for subsequent lifelong learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Humanoid Arm Motion via Centroidal Momentum Regularized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair climbing.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of VR-Enabled Robots and Human Operators for Targeted Disease Management in Vineyards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) as a control interface for agricultural robots in vineyard disease detection and treatment. Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed. However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others, completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38% faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks, immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in precision agriculture.</description>

      <title>An improved 2D time-to-collision for articulated vehicles: predicting sideswipe and rear-end collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-to-collision (TTC) is a widely used measure for estimating the time until a rear-end collision between two vehicles, assuming both maintain constant speeds and headings in the prediction horizon. To also capture sideswipe collisions, a two-dimensional extension, TTC$_{\text{2D}}$, was introduced. However, this formulation assumes both vehicles have the same heading and that their headings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in addition to the standard assumptions on the prediction horizon. Moreover, its use for articulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This paper addresses these limitations by developing three enhanced versions of TTC$_{\text{2D}}$. The first incorporates vehicle heading information, which is missing in the original formulation. The standard assumption of constant speed and heading in the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts this to articulated vehicles while retaining the assumptions of the first version. The third version maintains the constant heading assumption but relaxes the constant speed assumption by allowing constant acceleration. The versions are tested in a cut-in scenario using the CARLA simulation environment. They detect rear-end collisions, similar to TTC, and moreover, they also identify sideswipe risks, something TTC could not predict.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of A Unified Policy For Whole-body Manipulation and Locomotion Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equipping quadruped robots with manipulators provides unique loco-manipulation capabilities, enabling diverse practical applications. This integration creates a more complex system that has increased difficulties in modeling and control. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution to address these challenges by learning optimal control policies through interaction. Nevertheless, RL methods often struggle with local optima when exploring large solution spaces for motion and manipulation tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates an explicit kinematic model of the manipulator into the RL framework. This integration provides feedback on the mapping of the body postures to the manipulator's workspace, guiding the RL exploration process and effectively mitigating the local optima issue. Our algorithm has been successfully deployed on a DeepRobotics X20 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this approach.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of Three-Dimensional Wire Arrangement Considering Wire Crossings for Tendon-driven Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings. Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and discuss the obtained design solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of a Dual-Arm Robot for Efficient Strawberry Harvesting in Plant Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plant factory cultivation is widely recognized for its ability to optimize resource use and boost crop yields. To further increase the efficiency in these environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks, minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations. Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability. Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides. Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant factories.</description>

      <title>SRefiner: Soft-Braid Attention for Multi-Agent Trajectory Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of multi-agent future trajectories is crucial for autonomous driving systems to make safe and efficient decisions. Trajectory refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement. Code is here https://github.com/Liwen-Xiao/SRefiner.</description>

      <title>AutoLayout: Closed-Loop Layout Synthesis via Slow-Fast Collaborative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation (RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules, we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8 distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and functional completeness.</description>

      <title>Vibration-aware Lidar-Inertial Odometry based on Point-wise Post-Undistortion Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed ground robots moving on unstructured terrains generate intense high-frequency vibrations, leading to LiDAR scan distortions in Lidar-inertial odometry (LIO). Accurate and efficient undistortion is extremely challenging due to (1) rapid and non-smooth state changes during intense vibrations and (2) unpredictable IMU noise coupled with a limited IMU sampling frequency. To address this issue, this paper introduces post-undistortion uncertainty. First, we model the undistortion errors caused by linear and angular vibrations and assign post-undistortion uncertainty to each point. We then leverage this uncertainty to guide point-to-map matching, compute uncertainty-aware residuals, and update the odometry states using an iterated Kalman filter. We conduct vibration-platform and mobile-platform experiments on multiple public datasets as well as our own recordings, demonstrating that our method achieves better performance than other methods when LiDAR undergoes intense vibration.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Free Event Cameras Temporal Synchronization Based on Event Density Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of sensor designed for capturing the dynamic changes of a scene. Due to factors such as trigger and transmission delays, a time offset exists in the data collected by multiple event cameras, leading to inaccurate information fusion. Thus, the collected data needs to be synchronized to overcome any potential time offset issue. Hardware synchronization methods require additional circuits, while certain models of event cameras (e.g., CeleX5) do not support hardware synchronization. Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware-free event camera synchronization method. This method determines differences between start times by minimizing the dissimilarity of the event density distributions of different event cameras and synchronizes the data by adjusting timestamps. The experiments demonstrate that the method's synchronization error is less than 10ms under various senses with multiple models of event cameras.</description>

      <title>Lidar Variability: A Novel Dataset and Comparative Study of Solid-State and Spinning Lidars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lidar technology has been widely employed across various applications, such as robot localization in GNSS-denied environments and 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective solid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its dome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable performance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars, such as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars significantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across platforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state and high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently examined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.
  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from multiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped Mid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively includes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state and spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor data. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud registration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and hybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar systems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for future research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar platforms.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Policy: Lifting Scheme for Policy Learning in Long-Horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy learning focuses on devising strategies for agents in embodied artificial intelligence systems to perform optimal actions based on their perceived states. One of the key challenges in policy learning involves handling complex, long-horizon tasks that require managing extensive sequences of actions and observations with multiple modes. Wavelet analysis offers significant advantages in signal processing, notably in decomposing signals at multiple scales to capture both global trends and fine-grained details. In this work, we introduce a novel wavelet policy learning framework that utilizes wavelet transformations to enhance policy learning. Our approach leverages learnable multi-scale wavelet decomposition to facilitate detailed observation analysis and robust action planning over extended sequences. We detail the design and implementation of our wavelet policy, which incorporates lifting schemes for effective multi-resolution analysis and action generation. This framework is evaluated across multiple complex scenarios, including robotic manipulation, self-driving, and multi-robot collaboration, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in improving the precision and reliability of the learned policy.</description>

      <title>Robot-assisted Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Robo-TMS): A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and safe brain stimulation procedure with growing applications in clinical treatments and neuroscience research. However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration, neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration, learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS), and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to address these challenges.</description>

      <title>MLLM-Fabric: Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Robotic Framework for Fabric Sorting and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing the right fabric is crucial to meet functional and quality requirements in robotic applications for textile manufacturing, apparel production, and smart retail. We present MLLM-Fabric, a robotic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for fabric sorting and selection. The system includes a robotic arm, a camera, a visuotactile sensor, and a pressure sensor. It employs supervised fine-tuning and multimodal explanation-guided knowledge distillation to accurately classify and rank fabric properties. To facilitate further research, we release a dataset of 220 unique fabric samples, including RGB images and synchronized visuotactile and pressure data. Experimental results show that our Fabric-Llama-90B model consistently outperforms pretrained vision-language baselines in both property ranking accuracy and selection reliability.</description>

      <title>Implicit Dual-Control for Visibility-Aware Navigation in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating complex, cluttered, and unstructured environments that are a priori unknown presents significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles, particularly when operating with a limited field of view(FOV) resulting in frequent occlusion and unobserved space. This paper introduces a novel visibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated as a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions are intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a unified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances exploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance would be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against deterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a cluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results demonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision with unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example, in the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller achieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic controller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria rather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids unobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed framework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in unstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements in autonomous ground vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models. Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed, which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world applications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, operating in environments with relatively few obstacles, offer high maneuverability and full three-dimensional mobility. This allows them to rapidly approach objects and perform a wide range of tasks often challenging for ground robots, making them ideal for exploration, inspection, aerial imaging, and everyday assistance. In this paper, we introduce AirStar, a UAV-centric embodied platform that turns a UAV into an intelligent aerial assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering, intelligent filming, and target tracking. With a highly extensible framework, it supports seamless integration of new functionalities, paving the way toward a general-purpose, instruction-driven intelligent UAV agent.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for communication-aware motion planning of Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicles (MRAVs) using Free-Space Optical (FSO) links. The scenario involves MRAVs equipped with body-fixed optical transmitters and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) acting as mobile relays, each outfitted with fixed conical Field-of-View (FoV) receivers. The controller integrates optical connectivity constraints into the NMPC formulation to ensure beam alignment and minimum link quality, while also enabling UGV tracking and obstacle avoidance. The method supports both coplanar and tilted MRAV configurations. MATLAB simulations demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</description>

      <title>Verification of Visual Controllers via Compositional Geometric Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world. Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual perturbations.</description>

      <title>VLM-TDP: VLM-guided Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy for Robust Long-Horizon Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise, manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in long-horizon tasks.

      <title>The Difference between the Left and Right Invariant Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right- IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of the two filters.</description>

      <title>DragonFly: Single mmWave Radar 3D Localization of Highly Dynamic Tags in GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate localization and tracking of dynamic targets, such as equipment, people, vehicles, drones, robots, and the assets that they interact with in GPS-denied indoor environments is critical to enabling safe and efficient operations in the next generation of spatially aware industrial facilities. This paper presents DragonFly , a 3D localization system of highly dynamic backscatter tags using a single MIMO mmWave radar. The system delivers the first demonstration of a mmWave backscatter system capable of exploiting the capabilities of MIMO radars for the 3D localization of mmID tags moving at high speeds and accelerations at long ranges by introducing a critical Doppler disambiguation algorithm and a fully integrated cross-polarized dielectric lens-based mmID tag consuming a mere 68 uW. DragonFly was extensively evaluated in static and dynamic configurations, including on a flying quadcopter, and benchmarked against multiple baselines, demonstrating its ability to track the positions of multiple tags with a median 3D accuracy of 12 cm at speeds and acceleration on the order of 10 m/s-1 and 4 m/s-2 and at ranges of up to 50 m.</description>

      <title>IDAGC: Adaptive Generalized Human-Robot Collaboration via Human Intent Estimation and Multimodal Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which encompasses physical interaction and remote cooperation, accurate estimation of human intentions and seamless switching of collaboration modes to adjust robot behavior remain paramount challenges. To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of HRC.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Pointcloud Reintegrated Inference via Segmentation and Cross-attention for Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust imitation learning for robot manipulation requires comprehensive 3D perception, yet many existing methods struggle in cluttered environments. Fixed camera view approaches are vulnerable to perspective changes, and 3D point cloud techniques often limit themselves to keyframes predictions, reducing their efficacy in dynamic, contact-intensive tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PRISM, designed as an end-to-end framework that directly learns from raw point cloud observations and robot states, eliminating the need for pretrained models or external datasets. PRISM comprises three main components: a segmentation embedding unit that partitions the raw point cloud into distinct object clusters and encodes local geometric details; a cross-attention component that merges these visual features with processed robot joint states to highlight relevant targets; and a diffusion module that translates the fused representation into smooth robot actions. With training on 100 demonstrations per task, PRISM surpasses both 2D and 3D baseline policies in accuracy and efficiency within our simulated environments, demonstrating strong robustness in complex, object-dense scenarios. Code and some demos are available on https://github.com/czknuaa/PRISM.</description>

      <title>Bio-Inspired Hybrid Map: Spatial Implicit Local Frames and Topological Map for Mobile Cobot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional approaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps simultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ human-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to navigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high computational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to unseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans perceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments. Specifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent essential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are hybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features, so-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit local frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph. Lastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the topological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab environments. We open our source code at https://github.com/tuantdang/simn}{https://github.com/tuantdang/simn.</description>

      <title>DRAE: Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks for Lifelong Learning and Task Adaptation in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks (DRAE), a groundbreaking architecture that addresses the challenges of lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and task adaptation by combining the dynamic routing capabilities of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); leveraging the knowledge-enhancement power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); incorporating a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework; and coordinating through ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima (RSHO).DRAE dynamically routes expert models via a sparse MoE gating mechanism, enabling efficient resource allocation while leveraging external knowledge through parametric retrieval (P-RAG) to augment the learning process. We propose a new RL framework with ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning, and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models. Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable, and efficient lifelong learning for robotics.</description>

      <title>MOSU: Autonomous Long-range Robot Navigation with Multi-modal Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MOSU, a novel autonomous long-range navigation system that enhances global navigation for mobile robots through multimodal perception and on-road scene understanding. MOSU addresses the outdoor robot navigation challenge by integrating geometric, semantic, and contextual information to ensure comprehensive scene understanding. The system combines GPS and QGIS map-based routing for high-level global path planning and multi-modal trajectory generation for local navigation refinement. For trajectory generation, MOSU leverages multi-modalities: LiDAR-based geometric data for precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments. This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the GND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in traversability on navigable terrains while maintaining a comparable navigation distance to existing global navigation methods.</description>

      <title>CueLearner: Bootstrapping and local policy adaptation from relative feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these, relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness. Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.</description>

      <title>Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Merged Motion Planning: Effectively Leveraging Diverse Motion Datasets for Robust Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Safe Bimanual Teleoperation with Language-Guided Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperating precise bimanual manipulations in cluttered environments is challenging for operators, who often struggle with limited spatial perception and difficulty estimating distances between target objects, the robot's body, obstacles, and the surrounding environment. To address these challenges, local robot perception and control should assist the operator during teleoperation. In this work, we introduce a safe teleoperation system that enhances operator control by preventing collisions in cluttered environments through the combination of immersive VR control and voice-activated collision avoidance. Using HTC Vive controllers, operators directly control a bimanual mobile manipulator, while spoken commands such as "avoid the yellow tool" trigger visual grounding and segmentation to build 3D obstacle meshes. These meshes are integrated into a whole-body controller to actively prevent collisions during teleoperation. Experiments in static, cluttered scenes demonstrate that our system significantly improves operational safety without compromising task efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and multi-stability of a rotor-actuated Twistcar robot with passive steering joint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04846v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of many under-actuated wheeled platforms are governed by nonholonomic constraints of no-skid for passively rolling wheels, coupled with momentum balance. In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e. joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic systems of robotic locomotion.</description>

      <title>Piggyback Camera: Easy-to-Deploy Visual Surveillance by Mobile Sensing on Commercial Robot Vacuums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for object mapping of over 100 items.</description>

      <title>Automated UAV-based Wind Turbine Blade Inspection: Blade Stop Angle Estimation and Blade Detail Prioritized Exposure Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are critical in the automated inspection of wind turbine blades. Nevertheless, several issues persist in this domain. Firstly, existing inspection platforms encounter challenges in meeting the demands of automated inspection tasks and scenarios. Moreover, current blade stop angle estimation methods are vulnerable to environmental factors, restricting their robustness. Additionally, there is an absence of real-time blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment during capture, where lost details cannot be restored through post-optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce a platform and two approaches. Initially, a UAV inspection platform is presented to meet the automated inspection requirements. Subsequently, a Fermat point based blade stop angle estimation approach is introduced, achieving higher precision and success rates. Finally, we propose a blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment approach to ensure appropriate brightness and preserve details during image capture. Extensive tests, comprising over 120 flights across 10 wind turbine models in 5 operational wind farms, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing inspection autonomy.</description>

      <title>Unifying Robot Optimization: Monte Carlo Tree Search with Tensor Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However, MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Features: How Dataset Design Influences Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation, yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied. This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</description>

      <title>VerifyLLM: LLM-Based Pre-Execution Task Plan Verification for Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan. Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems.

      <title>Automated Behaviour-Driven Acceptance Testing of Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specification and validation of robotics applications require bridging the gap between formulating requirements and systematic testing. This often involves manual and error-prone tasks that become more complex as requirements, design, and implementation evolve. To address this challenge systematically, we propose extending behaviour-driven development (BDD) to define and verify acceptance criteria for robotic systems. In this context, we use domain-specific modelling and represent composable BDD models as knowledge graphs for robust querying and manipulation, facilitating the generation of executable testing models. A domain-specific language helps to efficiently specify robotic acceptance criteria. We explore the potential for automated generation and execution of acceptance tests through a software architecture that integrates a BDD framework, Isaac Sim, and model transformations, focusing on acceptance criteria for pick-and-place applications. We tested this architecture with an existing pick-and-place implementation and evaluated the execution results, which shows how this application behaves and fails differently when tested against variations of the agent and environment. This research advances the rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems, contributing to their reliability and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>LERa: Replanning with Visual Feedback in Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning, but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look, Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure detection - without additional information such as object detection or predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly. LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40% improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments, including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable solution for error-aware task execution in robotics. The code is available at https://lera-robo.github.io.</description>

      <title>EmbodieDreamer: Advancing Real2Sim2Real Transfer for Policy Training via Embodied World Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>NavigScene: Bridging Local Perception and Global Navigation for Beyond-Visual-Range Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&amp;A, perception, prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.</description>

      <title>StreamVLN: Streaming Vision-and-Language Navigation via SlowFast Context Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding, long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision, language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues, while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse, supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost. Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world deployment.

      <title>Action Space Reduction Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving: dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous driving tasks.</description>

      <title>A Simulator Dataset to Support the Study of Impaired Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment: alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\% blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.</description>

      <title>Control Synthesis in Partially Observable Environments for Complex Perception-Related Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic} (sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>DriveMRP: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Synthetic Motion Data for Motion Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces VISY-REVE: a novel pipeline to validate image processing algorithms for Vision-Based Navigation. Traditional validation methods such as synthetic rendering or robotic testbed acquisition suffer from difficult setup and slow runtime. Instead, we propose augmenting image datasets in real-time with synthesized views at novel poses. This approach creates continuous trajectories from sparse, pre-existing datasets in open or closed-loop. In addition, we introduce a new distance metric between camera poses, the Boresight Deviation Distance, which is better suited for view synthesis than existing metrics. Using it, a method for increasing the density of image datasets is developed.</description>

      <title>Query-Based Adaptive Aggregation for Multi-Dataset Joint Training Toward Universal Visual Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets. Code will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Robust Node Localization for Rough and Extreme Deployment Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications have been identified which require the deployment of large-scale low-power wireless sensor networks. Some of the deployment environments, however, impose harsh operation conditions due to intense cross-technology interference, extreme weather conditions (heavy rainfall, excessive heat, etc.), or rough motion, thereby affecting the quality and predictability of the wireless links the nodes establish. In localization tasks, these conditions often lead to significant errors in estimating the position of target nodes. Motivated by the practical deployments of sensors on the surface of different water bodies, we address the problem of identifying susceptible nodes and robustly estimating their positions. We formulate these tasks as a compressive sensing problem and propose algorithms for both node identification and robust estimation. Additionally, we design an optimal anchor configuration to maximize the robustness of the position estimation task. Our numerical results and comparisons with competitive methods demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve both objectives with a modest number of anchors. Since our method relies only on target-to-anchor distances, it is broadly applicable and yields resilient, robust localization.</description>

      <title>VISC: mmWave Radar Scene Flow Estimation using Pervasive Visual-Inertial Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite, allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches using costly LiDARs.</description>

      <title>SAFERad: A Framework to Enable Radar Data for Safety-Relevant Perception Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radar sensors play a crucial role for perception systems in automated driving but suffer from a high level of noise. In the past, this could be solved by strict filters, which remove most false positives at the expense of undetected objects. Future highly automated functions are much more demanding with respect to error rate. Hence, if the radar sensor serves as a component of perception systems for such functions, a simple filter strategy cannot be applied. In this paper, we present a modified filtering approach which is characterized by the idea to vary the filtering depending on the potential of harmful collision with the object which is potentially represented by the radar point. We propose an algorithm which determines a criticality score for each point based on the planned or presumable trajectory of the automated vehicle. Points identified as very critical can trigger manifold actions to confirm or deny object presence. Our pipeline introduces criticality regions. The filter threshold in these criticality regions is omitted. Commonly known radar data sets do not or barely feature critical scenes. Thus, we present an approach to evaluate our framework by adapting the planned trajectory towards vulnerable road users, which serve as ground truth critical points. Evaluation of the criticality metric prove high recall rates. Besides, our post-processing algorithm lowers the rate of non-clustered critical points by 74.8 % in an exemplary setup compared to a moderate, generic filter.</description>

      <title>NRSeg: Noise-Resilient Learning for BEV Semantic Segmentation via Driving World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model, where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lynn-yu/NRSeg.</description>

      <title>Breaking Imitation Bottlenecks: Reinforced Diffusion Powers Diverse Trajectory Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</description>

Abstract: Modern social robots can be considered the descendants of steam engines from the First Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0) and industrial robotic arms from the Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). As some time has passed since the introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI, this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</description>

      <title>Driver-Net: Multi-Camera Fusion for Assessing Driver Take-Over Readiness in Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Intention Prediction via Vision-Language Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames, physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to 19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual understanding for autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Mission-Aligned Learning-Informed Control of Autonomous Systems: Formulation and Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL -- presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.</description>

      <title>DreamVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model Dreamed with Comprehensive World Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Agentic Distributed Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most celebrated and extensively studied model of distributed computing is the {\em message-passing model,} in which each vertex/node of the (distributed network) graph corresponds to a static computational device that communicates with other devices through passing messages. In this paper, we consider the {\em agentic model} of distributed computing which extends the message-passing model in a new direction. In the agentic model, computational devices are modeled as relocatable or mobile computational devices (called agents in this paper), i.e., each vertex/node of the graph serves as a container for the devices, and hence communicating with another device requires relocating to the same node. We study two fundamental graph level tasks, leader election, and minimum spanning tree, in the agentic model, which will enhance our understanding of distributed computation across paradigms. The objective is to minimize both time and memory complexities. Following the literature, we consider the synchronous setting in which each agent performs its operations synchronously with others, and hence the time complexity can be measured in rounds. In this paper, we present two deterministic algorithms for leader election: one for the case of $k&lt;n$ and another for the case of $k=n$, minimizing both time and memory complexities, where $k$ and $n$, respectively, are the number of agents and number of nodes of the graph. Using these leader election results, we develop deterministic algorithms for agents to construct a minimum spanning tree of the graph, minimizing both time and memory complexities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of distributed graph level tasks in the agentic model with $k\leq n$. Previous studies only considered the case of $k=n$.</description>

      <title>Thousand-Brains Systems: Sensorimotor Intelligence for Rapid, Robust Learning and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception, and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation. Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture, a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual, and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and promising new approach to AI.</description>

      <title>U-ViLAR: Uncertainty-Aware Visual Localization for Autonomous Driving via Differentiable Association and Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.</description>

      <title>Grounded Gesture Generation: Language, Motion, and Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However, both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately, limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap, our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format. Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

      <title>Accelerated Online Reinforcement Learning using Auxiliary Start State Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward hard-exploration environment.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Stereo Matching in the Wild with Selective Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored, scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation. The code is available at \textcolor{red}{https://github.com/cocowy1/SMoE-Stereo}.</description>

      <title>From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>VOTE: Vision-Language-Action Optimization with Trajectory Ensemble Voting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency. This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Critiques of World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.</description>

      <title>From Marginal to Joint Predictions: Evaluating Scene-Consistent Trajectory Prediction Approaches for Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Beyond One Shot, Beyond One Perspective: Cross-View and Long-Horizon Distillation for Better LiDAR Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning; and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code has be made publicly accessible for future research.</description>

      <title>End-to-end 2D-3D Registration between Image and LiDAR Point Cloud for Vehicle Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot localization using a built map is essential for a variety of tasks including accurate navigation and mobile manipulation. A popular approach to robot localization is based on image-to-point cloud registration, which combines illumination-invariant LiDAR-based mapping with economical image-based localization. However, the recent works for image-to-point cloud registration either divide the registration into separate modules or project the point cloud to the depth image to register the RGB and depth images. In this paper, we present I2PNet, a novel end-to-end 2D-3D registration network, which directly registers the raw 3D point cloud with the 2D RGB image using differential modules with a united target. The 2D-3D cost volume module for differential 2D-3D association is proposed to bridge feature extraction and pose regression. The soft point-to-pixel correspondence is implicitly constructed on the intrinsic-independent normalized plane in the 2D-3D cost volume module. Moreover, we introduce an outlier mask prediction module to filter the outliers in the 2D-3D association before pose regression. Furthermore, we propose the coarse-to-fine 2D-3D registration architecture to increase localization accuracy. Extensive localization experiments are conducted on the KITTI, nuScenes, M2DGR, Argoverse, Waymo, and Lyft5 datasets. The results demonstrate that I2PNet outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin and has a higher efficiency than the previous works. Moreover, we extend the application of I2PNet to the camera-LiDAR online calibration and demonstrate that I2PNet outperforms recent approaches on the online calibration task.

      <title>TeachingBot: Robot Teacher for Human Handwriting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teaching and learning physical skills often require one-on-one interaction, making it difficult to scale up, as there are not enough human teachers. Robots offer an attractive alternative. This paper presents TeachingBot, an adaptive robotic system that teaches handwriting to human learners through physical interaction. Robot teaching poses two major challenges: (i) adapting to the individual handwriting style of the learner and (ii) maintaining an engaging learning experience. For the first challenge, TeachingBot uses a probabilistic model to capture the learner's writing style from their writing samples. Drawing on the insight that effective teaching balances standardization with individuality, the system generates a personalized teaching trajectory that aligns with the learner's natural writing. For the second challenge, TeachingBot employs variable impedance control to guide the learner, dynamically adjusting the strength of physical guidance based on the learner's performance. Human-subject experiments with 15 participants demonstrate the effectiveness of TeachingBot, showing clear improvement in learners' handwriting and engagement over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Gesture-Controlled Aerial Robot Formation for Human-Swarm Interaction in Safety Monitoring Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a formation control approach for contactless gesture-based Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI) between a team of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and a human worker. The approach is designed to monitor the safety of human workers, particularly those operating at heights. In the proposed dynamic formation scheme, one UAV acts as the formation leader, equipped with sensors for detecting human workers and recognizing gestures. The follower UAVs maintain a predetermined formation relative to the worker's position, providing additional perspectives of the monitored scene. Hand gestures enable the human worker to specify movement and action commands for the UAV team and to initiate other mission-related tasks without requiring additional communication channels or specific markers. Combined with a novel unified human detection and tracking algorithm, a human position estimation method, and a gesture detection pipeline, the proposed approach represents the first instance of an HSI system incorporating all these modules onboard real-world UAVs. Simulations and field experiments involving three UAVs and a human worker in a mock-up scenario demonstrate the effectiveness and responsiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Smoothing of Headland Path Edges and Headland-to-Mainfield Lane Transitions Based on a Spatial Domain Transformation and Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of in-field path planning, and under the assumption of nonholonomic vehicle models, this paper addresses two tasks: smoothing of headland path edges and smoothing of headland-to-mainfield lane transitions. Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits, such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning, are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</description>

      <title>PAVLM: Advancing Point Cloud based Affordance Understanding Via Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affordance understanding, the task of identifying actionable regions on 3D objects, plays a vital role in allowing robotic systems to engage with and operate within the physical world. Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

      <title>MENTOR: Mixture-of-Experts Network with Task-Oriented Perturbation for Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables robots to acquire skills from visual input for unstructured tasks. However, current algorithms suffer from low sample efficiency, limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we present MENTOR, a method that improves both the architecture and optimization of RL agents. Specifically, MENTOR replaces the standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) backbone and introduces a task-oriented perturbation mechanism. MENTOR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three simulation benchmarks and achieves an average of 83% success rate on three challenging real-world robotic manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing the 32% success rate of the strongest existing model-free visual RL algorithm. These results underscore the importance of sample efficiency in advancing visual RL for real-world robotics.

      <title>Learning Maximal Safe Sets Using Hypernetworks for MPC-based Local Trajectory Planning in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online estimation of maximal safe sets for local trajectory planning in unknown static environments. The neural representation of a set is used as the terminal set constraint for a model predictive control (MPC) local planner, resulting in improved recursive feasibility and safety. To achieve real-time performance and desired generalization properties, we employ the idea of hypernetworks. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis as the source of supervision during the training process, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against relevant baselines in simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show an increase in success rate of up to 52% compared to the best baseline while maintaining comparable execution speed. Additionally, we deploy our proposed method, NTC-MPC, on a physical robot and demonstrate its ability to safely avoid obstacles in scenarios where the baselines fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents two implementations of the recently developed motion planning algorithms HyRRT arXiv:2210.1508(2) and HySST arXiv:2305.1864(9). Specifically, cHyRRT, an implementation of the HyRRT algorithm, generates solutions to motion planning problems for hybrid systems with a probabilistic completeness guarantee, while cHySST, an implementation of the asymptotically near-optimal HySST algorithm, finds near-optimal trajectories based on a user-defined cost function. The implementations align with the theoretical foundations of hybrid system theory and are designed based on OMPL, ensuring compatibility with ROS while prioritizing computational efficiency. The structure, components, and usage of both tools are detailed. A modified pinball game and collision-resilient tensegrity multicopter example are provided to illustrate the tools' key capabilities.</description>

      <title>RoboHanger: Learning Generalizable Robotic Hanger Insertion for Diverse Garments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the task of hanging clothes, learning how to insert a hanger into a garment is a crucial step, but has rarely been explored in robotics. In this work, we address the problem of inserting a hanger into various unseen garments that are initially laid flat on a table. This task is challenging due to its long-horizon nature, the high degrees of freedom of the garments and the lack of data. To simplify the learning process, we first propose breaking the task into several subtasks. Then, we formulate each subtask as a policy learning problem and propose a low-dimensional action parameterization. To overcome the challenge of limited data, we build our own simulator and create 144 synthetic clothing assets to effectively collect high-quality training data. Our approach uses single-view depth images and object masks as input, which mitigates the Sim2Real appearance gap and achieves high generalization capabilities for new garments. Extensive experiments in both simulation and reality validate our proposed method. By training on various garments in the simulator, our method achieves a 75\% success rate with 8 different unseen garments in the real world.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to balance between exploitation and exploration. A shared consensus trunk is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulation and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel convex formulation that weakly couples the Material Point Method (MPM) with rigid body dynamics through frictional contact, optimized for efficient GPU parallelization. Our approach features an asynchronous time-splitting scheme to integrate MPM and rigid body dynamics under different time step sizes. We develop a globally convergent quasi-Newton solver tailored for massive parallelization, achieving up to 500x speedup over previous convex formulations without sacrificing stability. Our method enables interactive-rate simulations of robotic manipulation tasks with diverse deformable objects including granular materials and cloth, with strong convergence guarantees. We detail key implementation strategies to maximize performance and validate our approach through rigorous experiments, demonstrating superior speed, accuracy, and stability compared to state-of-the-art MPM simulators for robotics. We make our method available in the open-source robotics toolkit, Drake.</description>

      <title>D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</description>

      <title>Predictive Spray Switching for an Efficient Path Planning Pattern for Area Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents within an arable farming context a predictive logic for the on- and off-switching of a set of nozzles. The predictive logic is tailored to a specific path planning pattern. The nozzles are assumed to be attached to a boom aligned along a working width and carried by a machinery with the purpose of applying spray along the working width. The machinery is assumed to be traveling along the specific path planning pattern. Concatenation of multiple of those path patterns and corresponding concatenation of proposed switching logics enables nominal lossless spray application for area coverage tasks. Proposed predictive switching logic is compared to the common and state-of-the-art reactive switching logic for Boustrophedon-based path planning for area coverage. The trade-off between reduction in pathlength and increase in the number of required on- and off-switchings for proposed method is discussed.</description>

      <title>Making Physical Objects with Generative AI and Robotic Assembly: Considering Fabrication Constraints, Sustainability, Time, Functionality, and Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D generative AI enables rapid and accessible creation of 3D models from text or image inputs. However, translating these outputs into physical objects remains a challenge due to the constraints in the physical world. Recent studies have focused on improving the capabilities of 3D generative AI to produce fabricable outputs, with 3D printing as the main fabrication method. However, this workshop paper calls for a broader perspective by considering how fabrication methods align with the capabilities of 3D generative AI. As a case study, we present a novel system using discrete robotic assembly and 3D generative AI to make physical objects. Through this work, we identified five key aspects to consider in a physical making process based on the capabilities of 3D generative AI. 1) Fabrication Constraints: Current text-to-3D models can generate a wide range of 3D designs, requiring fabrication methods that can adapt to the variability of generative AI outputs. 2) Time: While generative AI can generate 3D models in seconds, fabricating physical objects can take hours or even days. Faster production could enable a closer iterative design loop between humans and AI in the making process. 3) Sustainability: Although text-to-3D models can generate thousands of models in the digital world, extending this capability to the real world would be resource-intensive, unsustainable and irresponsible. 4) Functionality: Unlike digital outputs from 3D generative AI models, the fabrication method plays a crucial role in the usability of physical objects. 5) Accessibility: While generative AI simplifies 3D model creation, the need for fabrication equipment can limit participation, making AI-assisted creation less inclusive. These five key aspects provide a framework for assessing how well a physical making process aligns with the capabilities of 3D generative AI and values in the world.</description>

      <title>Learning collision risk proactively from naturalistic driving data at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately and proactively alerting drivers or automated systems to emerging collisions is crucial for road safety, particularly in highly interactive and complex urban environments. However, existing approaches to identifying potential collisions either require labour-intensive annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying contextual factors, or are only useful in specific scenarios. To address these limits, this study introduces the Generalised Surrogate Safety Measure (GSSM), a new data-driven approach that learns collision risk exclusively from naturalistic driving without the need for crash or risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the extent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards an unsafe state. Diverse data from naturalistic driving, including motion kinematics, weather, lighting, etc., are used to train multiple GSSMs, which are tested with 2,591 reconstructed real-world crashes and near-crashes. These test events are also released here as the largest dataset of its kind to date. A basic GSSM using only instantaneous motion kinematics achieves an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential collisions. Additional interaction patterns and contextual factors provide further performance gains. Across various types of collision risk scenarios (such as rear-end, merging, and turning interactions), the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing baselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and generalisable foundation for proactively quantifying collision risk in traffic interactions. This can support and facilitate autonomous driving systems, traffic safety assessment, and road emergency management. Code and experiment data are openly accessible at https://github.com/Yiru-Jiao/GSSM.</description>

      <title>One Demo Is All It Takes: Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs from A Single Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving planning problems but often struggle to ensure plan correctness, especially for long-horizon tasks. Meanwhile, traditional robotic task and motion planning (TAMP) frameworks address these challenges more reliably by combining high-level symbolic search with low-level motion planning. At the core of TAMP is the planning domain, an abstract world representation defined through symbolic predicates and actions. However, creating these domains typically involves substantial manual effort and domain expertise, limiting generalizability. We introduce Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a novel approach that combines simulated physical interaction with LLM reasoning to improve planning performance. The method reduces reliance on humans by inferring planning domains from a single annotated task-execution demonstration. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains entirely from scratch and automatically integrates them with low-level motion planning skills, enabling fully automated long-horizon planning. PDDLLM is evaluated on over 1,200 diverse tasks spanning nine environments and benchmarked against six LLM-based planning baselines, demonstrating superior long-horizon planning performance, lower token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic static/dynamic triboelectric pressure sensor for continuous and event-triggered control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional pressure sensors often integrate two distinct mechanisms to detect static and dynamic stimuli, hindering the development of high fidelity human-machine interfaces. Here, we present an intrinsic static/dynamic triboelectric sensor (iSD Sensor) capable of reliably perceiving both continuous static pressure and transient mechanical shocks through a DC/AC signal decoupling strategy. By pairing hydrophobic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) with elastic conductive sponge, a pressure-adaptive triboelectric interface is formed, where microscale and large-scale separations enable static and dynamic pressure sensing, respectively. Furthermore, by employing a charge excitation strategy, the device delivers enhanced voltage outputs over 25X in static and 15X in dynamic modes. Combined with a 3D gradient conductive sponge structure, the sensor achieves multi-region sensitivities of 34.7 V/kPa (static) and 48.4 V/kPa (dynamic) under low pressure (less than 1.8 kPa), and a detection limit as low as 6.13 Pa. By perceiving continuous static pressure and transient shocks applied by the human hand, the iSD Sensor enables robotic arm control via proportional grasping and dynamic, trigger-based sign language communication. This work advances high-sensitivity, self-powered pressure sensors toward intelligent, closed-loop human-machine interaction.</description>

      <title>SLAC: Simulation-Pretrained Latent Action Space for Whole-Body Real-World RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

      <title>Casper: Inferring Diverse Intents for Assistive Teleoperation with Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assistive teleoperation, where control is shared between a human and a robot, enables efficient and intuitive human-robot collaboration in diverse and unstructured environments. A central challenge in real-world assistive teleoperation is for the robot to infer a wide range of human intentions from user control inputs and to assist users with correct actions. Existing methods are either confined to simple, predefined scenarios or restricted to task-specific data distributions at training, limiting their support for real-world assistance. We introduce Casper, an assistive teleoperation system that leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained visual language models (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill execution. Casper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized understanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference mechanism that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of teleoperated user input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior assistive teleoperation systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive empirical evaluation, including human studies and system ablations, demonstrates that Casper improves task performance, reduces human cognitive load, and achieves higher user satisfaction than direct teleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines.

      <title>Human2LocoMan: Learning Versatile Quadrupedal Manipulation with Human Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the amount of robot data.

      <title>RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 9% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</description>

      <title>NOVA: Navigation via Object-Centric Visual Autonomy for High-Speed Target Tracking in Unstructured GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions. We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full 6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame. To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.</description>

      <title>PIMBS: Efficient Body Schema Learning for Musculoskeletal Humanoids with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal humanoids are robots that closely mimic the human musculoskeletal system, offering various advantages such as variable stiffness control, redundancy, and flexibility. However, their body structure is complex, and muscle paths often significantly deviate from geometric models. To address this, numerous studies have been conducted to learn body schema, particularly the relationships among joint angles, muscle tension, and muscle length. These studies typically rely solely on data collected from the actual robot, but this data collection process is labor-intensive, and learning becomes difficult when the amount of data is limited. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method that applies the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the learning of body schema in musculoskeletal humanoids, enabling high-accuracy learning even with a small amount of data. By utilizing not only data obtained from the actual robot but also the physical laws governing the relationship between torque and muscle tension under the assumption of correct joint structure, more efficient learning becomes possible. We apply the proposed method to both simulation and an actual musculoskeletal humanoid and discuss its effectiveness and characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving technologies face significant safety challenges while operating under rare, diverse, and visually degraded weather scenarios. These challenges become more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address these issues, we propose SEAL, a vision-language model-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. SEAL introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAL significantly outperforms existing baselines in reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the safety, robustness, and scalability of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>ParticleFormer: A 3D Point Cloud World Model for Multi-Object, Multi-Material Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

Abstract: Teleoperation with non-haptic VR controllers deprives human operators of critical motion feedback. We address this by embedding a multi-objective optimization problem that converts user input into collision-free UR5e joint trajectories while actively suppressing liquid slosh in a glass. The controller maintains 13 ms average planning latency, confirming real-time performance and motivating the augmentation of this teleoperation approach to further objectives.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring, wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CoInfra, a large-scale cooperative infrastructure perception system and dataset designed to advance robust multi-agent perception under real-world and adverse weather conditions. The CoInfra system includes 14 fully synchronized sensor nodes, each equipped with dual RGB cameras and a LiDAR, deployed across a shared region and operating continuously to capture all traffic participants in real-time. A robust, delay-aware synchronization protocol and a scalable system architecture that supports real-time data fusion, OTA management, and remote monitoring are provided in this paper. On the other hand, the dataset was collected in different weather scenarios, including sunny, rainy, freezing rain, and heavy snow and includes 195k LiDAR frames and 390k camera images from 8 infrastructure nodes that are globally time-aligned and spatially calibrated. Furthermore, comprehensive 3D bounding box annotations for five object classes (i.e., car, bus, truck, person, and bicycle) are provided in both global and individual node frames, along with high-definition maps for contextual understanding. Baseline experiments demonstrate the trade-offs between early and late fusion strategies, the significant benefits of HD map integration are discussed. By openly releasing our dataset, codebase, and system documentation at https://github.com/NingMingHao/CoInfra, we aim to enable reproducible research and drive progress in infrastructure-supported autonomous driving, particularly in challenging, real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Start Locations in Ergodic Search for Disaster Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In disaster response scenarios, deploying robotic teams effectively is crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91% on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the ergodic metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep transformer network for estimating the relative 6D pose of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with respect to a ship using monocular images. A synthetic dataset of ship images is created and annotated with 2D keypoints of multiple ship parts. A Transformer Neural Network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in-situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8\% and 1.0\% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively. The method has potential applications for ship-based autonomous UAV landing and navigation.</description>

      <title>Event-based Stereo Depth Estimation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stereopsis has widespread appeal in robotics as it is the predominant way by which living beings perceive depth to navigate our 3D world. Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that detect per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, with very high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, enabling machine perception in high-speed motion and broad illumination conditions. The high temporal precision also benefits stereo matching, making disparity (depth) estimation a popular research area for event cameras ever since its inception. Over the last 30 years, the field has evolved rapidly, from low-latency, low-power circuit design to current deep learning (DL) approaches driven by the computer vision community. The bibliography is vast and difficult to navigate for non-experts due its highly interdisciplinary nature. Past surveys have addressed distinct aspects of this topic, in the context of applications, or focusing only on a specific class of techniques, but have overlooked stereo datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, covering both instantaneous stereo and long-term methods suitable for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), along with theoretical and empirical comparisons. It is the first to extensively review DL methods as well as stereo datasets, even providing practical suggestions for creating new benchmarks to advance the field. The main advantages and challenges faced by event-based stereo depth estimation are also discussed. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in achieving optimal performance in not only accuracy but also efficiency, a cornerstone of event-based computing. We identify several gaps and propose future research directions. We hope this survey inspires future research in this area, by serving as an accessible entry point for newcomers, as well as a practical guide for seasoned researchers in the community.</description>

      <title>Gesture Recognition for Feedback Based Mixed Reality and Robotic Fabrication: A Case Study of the UnLog Tower</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) platforms enable users to interact with three-dimensional holographic instructions during the assembly and fabrication of highly custom and parametric architectural constructions without the necessity of two-dimensional drawings. Previous MR fabrication projects have primarily relied on digital menus and custom buttons as the interface for user interaction with the MR environment. Despite this approach being widely adopted, it is limited in its ability to allow for direct human interaction with physical objects to modify fabrication instructions within the MR environment. This research integrates user interactions with physical objects through real-time gesture recognition as input to modify, update or generate new digital information enabling reciprocal stimuli between the physical and the virtual environment. Consequently, the digital environment is generative of the user's provided interaction with physical objects to allow seamless feedback in the fabrication process. This research investigates gesture recognition for feedback-based MR workflows for robotic fabrication, human assembly, and quality control in the construction of the UnLog Tower.</description>

      <title>Physics Encoded Blocks in Residual Neural Network Architectures for Digital Twin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics Informed Machine Learning has emerged as a popular approach for modeling and simulation in digital twins, enabling the generation of accurate models of processes and behaviors in real-world systems. However, existing methods either rely on simple loss regularizations that offer limited physics integration or employ highly specialized architectures that are difficult to generalize across diverse physical systems. This paper presents a generic approach based on a novel physics-encoded residual neural network (PERNN) architecture that seamlessly combines data-driven and physics-based analytical models to overcome these limitations. Our method integrates differentiable physics blocks-implementing mathematical operators from physics-based models with feed-forward learning blocks, while intermediate residual blocks ensure stable gradient flow during training. Consequently, the model naturally adheres to the underlying physical principles even when prior physics knowledge is incomplete, thereby improving generalizability with low data requirements and reduced model complexity. We investigate our approach in two application domains. The first is a steering model for autonomous vehicles in a simulation environment, and the second is a digital twin for climate modeling using an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based model of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) to enable gap-filling in flux tower data. In both cases, our method outperforms conventional neural network approaches as well as state-of-the-art Physics Informed Machine Learning methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose MMD-OPT: a sample-efficient approach for minimizing the risk of collision under arbitrary prediction distribution of the dynamic obstacles. MMD-OPT is based on embedding distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and the associated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We show how these two concepts can be used to define a sample efficient surrogate for collision risk estimate. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of MMD-OPT on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Importantly, we show that trajectory optimization with our MMD-based collision risk surrogate leads to safer trajectories at low sample regimes than popular alternatives based on Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).</description>

      <title>Boundary Exploration of Next Best View Policy in 3D Robotic Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Next Best View (NBV) problem is a pivotal challenge in 3D robotic scanning, with the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of object capture and reconstruction. Existing methods for determining the NBV often overlook view overlap, assume a fixed virtual origin for the camera, and rely on voxel-based representations of 3D data. To address these limitations and enhance the practicality of scanning unknown objects, we propose an NBV policy in which the next view explores the boundary of the scanned point cloud, with overlap intrinsically considered. The scanning or working distance of the camera is user-defined and remains flexible throughout the process. To this end, we first introduce a model-based approach in which candidate views are iteratively proposed based on a reference model. Scores are computed using a carefully designed strategy that accounts for both view overlap and convergence. In addition, we propose a learning-based method, the Boundary Exploration NBV Network (BENBV-Net), which predicts the NBV directly from the scanned data without requiring a reference model. BENBV-Net estimates scores for candidate boundaries, selecting the one with the highest score as the target for the next best view. It offers a significant improvement in NBV generation speed while maintaining the performance level of the model-based approach. We evaluate both methods on the ShapeNet, ModelNet, and 3D Repository datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of scanning efficiency, final coverage, and overlap stability, all of which are critical for practical 3D scanning applications. The related code is available at github.com/leihui6/BENBV.</description>

      <title>Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of bundle adjustment (i.e., simultaneous refinement of camera poses and scene map) for a purely rotating event camera. Starting from first principles, we formulate the problem as a classical non-linear least squares optimization. The photometric error is defined using the event generation model directly in the camera rotations and the semi-dense scene brightness that triggers the events. We leverage the sparsity of event data to design a tractable Levenberg-Marquardt solver that handles the very large number of variables involved. To the best of our knowledge, our method, which we call Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment (EPBA), is the first event-only photometric bundle adjustment method that works on the brightness map directly and exploits the space-time characteristics of event data, without having to convert events into image-like representations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EPBA's effectiveness in decreasing the photometric error (by up to 90%), yielding results of unparalleled quality. The refined maps reveal details that were hidden using prior state-of-the-art rotation-only estimation methods. The experiments on modern high-resolution event cameras show the applicability of EPBA to panoramic imaging in various scenarios (without map initialization, at multiple resolutions, and in combination with other methods, such as IMU dead reckoning or previous event-based rotation estimation methods). We make the source code publicly available. https://github.com/tub-rip/epba</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for enhancing accessibility and usability in real-world robotics applications. However, existing solutions often rely on gestures or language commands, making interaction inefficient and ambiguous, particularly for users with physical impairments. In this paper, we introduce FAM-HRI, an efficient multi-modal framework for human-robot interaction that integrates language and gaze inputs via foundation models. By leveraging lightweight Meta ARIA glasses, our system captures real-time multi-modal signals and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to fuse user intention with scene context, enabling intuitive and precise robot manipulation. Our method accurately determines gaze fixation time interval, reducing noise caused by the gaze dynamic nature. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FAM-HRI achieves a high success rate in task execution while maintaining a low interaction time, providing a practical solution for individuals with limited physical mobility or motor impairments.</description>

      <title>Graph-Assisted Stitching for Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE) metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0.

      <title>RaCalNet: Radar Calibration Network for Sparse-Supervised Metric Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15560</link>

Abstract: Dense depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, for guiding the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1\% compared to dense-supervised methods. RaCalNet is composed of two key modules. The Radar Recalibration module performs radar point screening and pixel-wise displacement refinement, producing accurate and reliable depth priors from sparse radar inputs. These priors are then used by the Metric Depth Optimization module, which learns to infer scene-level scale priors and fuses them with monocular depth predictions to achieve metrically accurate outputs. This modular design enhances structural consistency and preserves fine-grained geometric details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet produces depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures, demonstrating superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods. Quantitatively, it achieves performance comparable to existing methods on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and yields a 34.89\% RMSE reduction in real-world deployment scenarios. We plan to gradually release the code and models in the future at https://github.com/818slam/RaCalNet.git.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing Ubiquitous Indoor Localization with Non-Cooperative Wi-Fi Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization opens the path to potentially transformative applications. Although many indoor localization methods have been proposed over the years, they remain too impractical for widespread deployment in the real world. In this paper, we introduce PeepLoc, a deployable and scalable Wi-Fi-based solution for indoor localization that relies only on pre-existing devices and infrastructure. Specifically, PeepLoc works on any mobile device with an unmodified Wi-Fi transceiver and in any indoor environment with a sufficient number of Wi-Fi access points (APs) and pedestrian traffic. At the core of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain non-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel bootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and crowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points within an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and evaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a mean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is superior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive with commodity GPS in outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>EndoFlow-SLAM: Real-Time Endoscopic SLAM with Flow-Constrained Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both static and dynamic surgical scenes.</description>
