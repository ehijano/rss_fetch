      <title>Causal Inference for Aggregated Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study causal inference when the treatment variable is an aggregation of multiple sub-treatment variables. Researchers often report marginal causal effects for the aggregated treatment, implicitly assuming that the target parameter corresponds to a well-defined average of sub-treatment effects. We show that, even in an ideal scenario for causal inference such as random assignment, the weights underlying this average have some key undesirable properties: they are not unique, they can be negative, and, holding all else constant, these issues become exponentially more likely to occur as the number of sub-treatments increases and the support of each sub-treatment grows. We propose approaches to avoid these problems, depending on whether or not the sub-treatment variables are observed.</description>

      <title>Design-Based and Network Sampling-Based Uncertainties in Network Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OLS estimators are widely used in network experiments to estimate spillover effects via regressions on exposure mappings that summarize treatment and network structure. We study the causal interpretation and inference of such OLS estimators when both design-based uncertainty in treatment assignment and sampling-based uncertainty in network links are present. We show that correlations among elements of the exposure mapping can contaminate the OLS estimand, preventing it from aggregating heterogeneous spillover effects for clear causal interpretation. We derive the estimator's asymptotic distribution and propose a network-robust variance estimator. Simulations and an empirical application reveal sizable contamination bias and inflated spillover estimates.</description>

      <title>Modeling European Electricity Market Integration during turbulent times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Bayesian reverse unrestricted mixed-frequency model applied to a panel of nine European electricity markets. Our model analyzes the impact of daily fossil fuel prices and hourly renewable energy generation on hourly electricity prices, employing a hierarchical structure to capture cross-country interdependencies and idiosyncratic factors. The inclusion of random effects demonstrates that electricity market integration both mitigates and amplifies shocks. Our results highlight that while renewable energy sources consistently reduce electricity prices across all countries, gas prices remain a dominant driver of cross-country electricity price disparities and instability. This finding underscores the critical importance of energy diversification, above all on renewable energy sources, and coordinated fossil fuel supply strategies for bolstering European energy security.</description>

      <title>P-CRE-DML: A Novel Approach for Causal Inference in Non-Linear Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Proxy-Enhanced Correlated Random Effects Double Machine Learning (P-CRE-DML) framework to estimate causal effects in panel data with non-linearities and unobserved heterogeneity. Combining Double Machine Learning (DML, Chernozhukov et al., 2018), Correlated Random Effects (CRE, Mundlak, 1978), and lagged variables (Arellano &amp; Bond, 1991) and innovating within the CRE-DML framework (Chernozhukov et al., 2022; Clarke &amp; Polselli, 2025; Fuhr &amp; Papies, 2024), we apply P-CRE-DML to investigate the effect of social trust on GDP growth across 89 countries (2010-2020). We find positive and statistically significant relationship between social trust and economic growth. This aligns with prior findings on trust-growth relationship (e.g., Knack &amp; Keefer, 1997). Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates P-CRE-DML's advantage in terms of lower bias over CRE-DML and System GMM. P-CRE-DML offers a robust and flexible alternative for panel data causal inference, with applications beyond economic growth.</description>

      <title>An Improved Inference for IV Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers often report empirical results that are based on low-dimensional IVs, such as the shift-share IV, together with many IVs. Could we combine these results in an efficient way and take advantage of the information from both sides? In this paper, we propose a combination inference procedure to solve the problem. Specifically, we consider a linear combination of three test statistics: a standard cluster-robust Wald statistic based on the low-dimensional IVs, a leave-one-cluster-out Lagrangian Multiplier (LM) statistic, and a leave-one-cluster-out Anderson-Rubin (AR) statistic. We first establish the joint asymptotic normality of the Wald, LM, and AR statistics and derive the corresponding limit experiment under local alternatives. Then, under the assumption that at least the low-dimensional IVs can strongly identify the parameter of interest, we derive the optimal combination test based on the three statistics and establish that our procedure leads to the uniformly most powerful (UMP) unbiased test among the class of tests considered. In particular, the efficiency gain from the combined test is of ``free lunch" in the sense that it is always at least as powerful as the test that is only based on the low-dimensional IVs or many IVs.</description>

      <title>Testing parametric additive time-varying GARCH models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop misspecification tests for building additive time-varying (ATV-)GARCH models. In the model, the volatility equation of the GARCH model is augmented by a deterministic time-varying intercept modeled as a linear combination of logistic transition functions. The intercept is specified by a sequence of tests, moving from specific to general. The first test is the test of the standard stationary GARCH model against an ATV-GARCH model with one transition. The alternative model is unidentified under the null hypothesis, which makes the usual LM test invalid. To overcome this problem, we use the standard method of approximating the transition function by a Taylor expansion around the null hypothesis. Testing proceeds until the first non-rejection. We investigate the small-sample properties of the tests in a comprehensive simulation study. An application to the VIX index indicates that the volatility of the index is not constant over time but begins a slow increase around the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference with High-Dimensional Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a weak-identification-robust test for linear instrumental variable (IV) regressions with high-dimensional instruments, whose number is allowed to exceed the sample size. In addition, our test is robust to general error dependence, such as network dependence and spatial dependence. The test statistic takes a self-normalized form and the asymptotic validity of the test is established by using random matrix theory. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the numerical performance of the test, confirming good size control and satisfactory testing power across a range of various error dependence structures.</description>

      <title>Minimax and Bayes Optimal Best-arm Identification: Adaptive Experimental Design for Treatment Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice, also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.</description>

      <title>Doubly robust estimation of causal effects for random object outcomes with continuous treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference is central to statistics and scientific discovery, enabling researchers to identify cause-and-effect relationships beyond associations. While traditionally studied within Euclidean spaces, contemporary applications increasingly involve complex, non-Euclidean data structures that reside in abstract metric spaces, known as random objects, such as images, shapes, networks, and distributions. This paper introduces a novel framework for causal inference with continuous treatments applied to non-Euclidean data. To address the challenges posed by the lack of linear structures, we leverage Hilbert space embeddings of the metric spaces to facilitate Fr\'echet mean estimation and causal effect mapping. Motivated by a study on the impact of exposure to fine particulate matter on age-at-death distributions across U.S. counties, we propose a nonparametric, doubly-debiased causal inference approach for outcomes as random objects with continuous treatments. Our framework can accommodate moderately high-dimensional vector-valued confounders and derive efficient influence functions for estimation to ensure both robustness and interpretability. We establish rigorous asymptotic properties of the cross-fitted estimators and employ conformal inference techniques for counterfactual outcome prediction. Validated through numerical experiments and applied to real-world environmental data, our framework extends causal inference methodologies to complex data structures, broadening its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Overparametrized models with posterior drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of posterior drift on out-of-sample forecasting accuracy in overparametrized machine learning models. We document the loss in performance when the loadings of the data generating process change between the training and testing samples. This matters crucially in settings in which regime changes are likely to occur, for instance, in financial markets. Applied to equity premium forecasting, our results underline the sensitivity of a market timing strategy to sub-periods and to the bandwidth parameters that control the complexity of the model. For the average investor, we find that focusing on holding periods of 15 years can generate very heterogeneous returns, especially for small bandwidths. Large bandwidths yield much more consistent outcomes, but are far less appealing from a risk-adjusted return standpoint. All in all, our findings tend to recommend cautiousness when resorting to large linear models for stock market predictions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Omitted Variables on the Sign of Regression Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, depending on how the impact of omitted variables is measured, it can be substantially easier for omitted variables to flip coefficient signs than to drive them to zero. This behavior occurs with "Oster's delta" (Oster 2019), a widely reported robustness measure. Consequently, any time this measure is large -- suggesting that omitted variables may be unimportant -- a much smaller value reverses the sign of the parameter of interest. We propose a modified measure of robustness to address this concern. We illustrate our results in four empirical applications and two meta-analyses. We implement our methods in the companion Stata module regsensitivity.</description>

      <title>On the Identifying Power of Monotonicity for Average Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of a binary outcome, treatment, and instrument, Balke and Pearl (1993, 1997) establish that the monotonicity condition of Imbens and Angrist (1994) has no identifying power beyond instrument exogeneity for average potential outcomes and average treatment effects in the sense that adding it to instrument exogeneity does not decrease the identified sets for those parameters whenever those restrictions are consistent with the distribution of the observable data. This paper shows that this phenomenon holds in a broader setting with a multi-valued outcome, treatment, and instrument, under an extension of the monotonicity condition that we refer to as generalized monotonicity. We further show that this phenomenon holds for any restriction on treatment response that is stronger than generalized monotonicity provided that these stronger restrictions do not restrict potential outcomes. Importantly, many models of potential treatments previously considered in the literature imply generalized monotonicity, including the types of monotonicity restrictions considered by Kline and Walters (2016), Kirkeboen et al. (2016), and Heckman and Pinto (2018), and the restriction that treatment selection is determined by particular classes of additive random utility models. We show through a series of examples that restrictions on potential treatments can provide identifying power beyond instrument exogeneity for average potential outcomes and average treatment effects when the restrictions imply that the generalized monotonicity condition is violated. In this way, our results shed light on the types of restrictions required for help in identifying average potential outcomes and average treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Optimal Post-Hoc Theorizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many economic questions, the empirical results are not interesting unless they are strong. For these questions, theorizing before the results are known is not always optimal. Instead, the optimal sequencing of theory and empirics trades off a ``Darwinian Learning'' effect from theorizing first with a ``Statistical Learning'' effect from examining the data first. This short paper formalizes the tradeoff in a Bayesian model. In the modern era of mature economic theory and enormous datasets, I argue that post hoc theorizing is typically optimal.</description>

      <title>What Makes Treatment Effects Identifiable? Characterizations and Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.
  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational studies with complex treatment mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Adaptive experiments such as multi-armed bandits offer efficiency gains over traditional randomized experiments but pose two major challenges: invalid inference on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) due to adaptive sampling and low statistical power for sub-optimal treatments. We address both issues by extending the Mixture Adaptive Design framework (arXiv:2311.05794). First, we propose MADCovar, a covariate-adjusted ATE estimator that is unbiased and preserves anytime-valid inference guarantees while substantially improving ATE precision. Second, we introduce MADMod, which dynamically reallocates samples to underpowered arms, enabling more balanced statistical power across treatments without sacrificing valid inference. Both methods retain MAD's core advantage of constructing asymptotic confidence sequences (CSs) that allow researchers to continuously monitor ATE estimates and stop data collection once a desired precision or significance criterion is met. Empirically, we validate both methods using simulations and real-world data. In simulations, MADCovar reduces CS width by up to $60\%$ relative to MAD. In a large-scale political RCT with $\approx32,000$ participants, MADCovar achieves similar precision gains. MADMod improves statistical power and inferential precision across all treatment arms, particularly for suboptimal treatments. Simulations show that MADMod sharply reduces Type II error while preserving the efficiency benefits of adaptive allocation. Together, MADCovar and MADMod make adaptive experiments more practical, reliable, and efficient for applied researchers across many domains. Our proposed methods are implemented through an open-source software package.</description>
