      <title>Localization for Lipschitz monotone quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ via Rellich functions analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Anderson localization and exponential dynamical localization for a class of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with bounded or unbounded Lipschitz monotone potentials via multi-scale analysis based on Rellich function analysis in the perturbative regime. We show that at each scale, the resonant Rellich function uniformly inherits the Lipschitz monotonicity property of the potential via a novel Schur complement argument.</description>

      <title>Field Theories on Quantum Space-Times: Towards the Phenomenology of Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncommutative geometry is a mathematical framework that expresses the structure of space-time in terms of operator algebras. By using the tools of quantum mechanics to describe the geometry, noncommutative space-times are expected to give rise to quantum gravity effects, at least in some regime. This manuscript focuses on the physical aspects of these so-called quantum space-times, in particular through the formalism of field and gauge theories. Scalar field theories are shown to possibly trigger mixed divergences in the infra-red and ultra-violet for the 2-point function at one loop. This phenomenon is generically called UV/IR mixing and stems from a diverging behaviour of the propagator. The analysis of such divergences differs from the commutative case because the momentum space is now also noncommutative. From another perspective, a gauge theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski, a quantum deformation of the Minkowski space-time, is derived. A first perturbative computation is shown to break the gauge invariance, a pathological behaviour common to other quantum space-times. A causality toy model is also developed on $\kappa$-Minkowski, in which an analogue of the speed-of-light limit emerges. The phenomenology of quantum gravity arising from quantum space-times is discussed, together with the actual constraints it imposes. Finally, a toy model for noncommutative gravity is tackled, using the former $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time to describe the tangent space. It necessitates the notion of noncommutative partition of unity specifically defined there.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the strictly convex quadrilateral central configuration with a fixed angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjecture of the existence and the uniqueness of the strictly convex quadrilateral central configuration for the Newtonian 4-body problem is one of the most-talked open problems in the study of the classical n-body problems in celestial mechanics. MacMillan and Bartky first gave its general existence in the 1930s and a particular case for its uniqueness. Still, the general case has yet to be solved perfectly since it was considered by Sim'{o} and Yoccoz in the 1980s and was first mentioned by Albouy and Fu in 2008 in the formal publication. Using coordinates of mutual distances and Morse's critical point theory, we give the (at most) uniqueness of the planar strictly convex 4-body central configuration when the angle of one pair of the opposite sides is given.</description>

      <title>Interaction spaces: towards a universal mathematical theory of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first steps of interaction spaces theory, a universal mathematical theory of complex systems which is able to embed cellular automata, agent based models, master equation based models, stochastic or deterministic, continuous or discrete dynamical systems, networked dynamical models, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms in a single notion. Therefore, interaction spaces represent a common mathematical language that can be used to describe several complex systems modeling frameworks. This is the first step to start a mathematical theory of complex systems. Every notion is introduced both using an intuitive description by listing lots of examples, and using a modern mathematical language.</description>

      <title>A mathematical definition of complex adaptive system as interaction space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a mathematical notion of complex adaptive system by following the original intuition of G.K. Zipf about the principle of least effort, an intuitive idea which is nowadays informally widespread in complex systems modeling. We call generalized evolution principle this mathematical notion of interaction spaces theory. Formalizing and generalizing Mandelbrot's ideas, we also prove that a large class of these systems satisfy a power law. We finally illustrate the notion of complex adaptive system with theorems describing a Von Th\"unen-like model. The latter can be easily generalized to other complex systems and describes the appearance of emergent patterns. Every notion is introduced both using an intuitive description with lots of examples, and using a modern mathematical language.</description>

      <title>Quantum KdV and shifted symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of the quantum Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy defined by Buryak and Rossi. We prove that eigenvalues to first order in the dispersion parameter are given by shifted symmetric functions. The proof is based on the boson-fermion correspondence and an analysis of quartic expressions in fermions. As an application, we obtain a new closed evaluation of certain double Hodge integrals on the moduli spaces of curves. Finally, we provide an explicit formula for the eigenvectors to first order in the dispersion parameter. In particular, we show that its Schur expansion is supported on partitions for which the Hamming distance is minimal.</description>

      <title>The Symplectic Schur Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a measure on tuples of partitions, called the symplectic Schur process, that should be regarded as the right analogue of the Schur process of Okounkov-Reshetikhin for the Cartan type C. The weights of our measure include factors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of "Down-Up Schur functions" that we define and for which we prove new identities of Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process corresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an explicit correlation kernel. We also present dynamics that preserve the family of symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based on the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the limit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit regimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.</description>

      <title>Algebraic realisation of three fermion generations with $S_3$ family and unbroken gauge symmetry from $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on previous work, we extend an algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within the complex Clifford algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, by incorporating an unbroken $U(1)_{em}$ gauge symmetry. The algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ is the multiplication algebra of the complexification of the Cayley-Dickson algebra of sedenions, $\mathbb{S}$. Previous work represented three generations of fermions with $SU(3)_C$ colour symmetry, permuted by an $S_3$ symmetry of order-three. However, it proved difficult to find a $U(1)$ generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states. By generalising the embedding of the order-three $S_3$ automorphism of $\mathbb{S}$ into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, we include an $S_3$-invariant $U(1)$ that correctly assigns electric charge. First generation states are represented in terms of two even $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ semi-spinors, obtained from two minimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two $S_3$ symmetry. The remaining two generations are obtained by applying the $S_3$ symmetry of order-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries, $SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}$, are $S_3$-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors. As a result of the generalised embedding of the $S_3$ automorphisms of $\mathbb{S}$ into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, the three generations are linearly independent, in contrast to earlier work.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-induction of Superconformal Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The successful application of $\alpha$-induction to the conformal field theory has given rise to many amazing results. For example, the classification of conformal nets in the discrete series. In this paper, however, we study $\alpha$-induction of graded local conformal nets. The main difference lies between locality in the conformal net cases and graded locality in the graded local conformal net cases. We show that the inclusions of graded local conformal nets give braided subfactors. We check that the $\alpha$-induction is still valid in terms of graded local conformal nets. Moreover, the simple current extension originally defined in terms of conformal nets still works for graded local conformal nets. Consequently, we give a shorter proof of classification of $N=2$ superconformal nets in the discrete series according to Gannon's list.</description>

      <title>Simple proof that there is no sign problem in Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations of fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely known that there is no sign problem in Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of fermions in one dimension. Yet, as far as the author is aware, there is no direct proof of this in the literature. This work shows that the $sign$ of the $N$-fermion anti-symmetric free propagator is given by the product of all possible pairs of particle separations, or relative displacements. For a non-vanishing closed-loop product of such propagators, as required by PIMC, all relative displacements from adjacent propagators are paired into perfect squares, and therefore the loop product must be positive, but only in one dimension. By comparison, permutation sampling, which does not evaluate the determinant of the anti-symmetric propagator exactly, remains plagued by a low-level sign problem, even in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Free field realizations for rank-one SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the associated vertex operator algebras for all $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories of rank one. We give a uniform presentation through free-field realizations, which turns out to be a particularly suitable framework for this task. The elementary building blocks of the construction are dictated by the low energy degrees of freedom on the Higgs branch, which are well understood for rank-one theories. We further analyze the interplay between Higgs and Coulomb data on the moduli space of vacua, which tightly constrain the overall structure of the free field realizations. Our results suggest a plausible bottom-up classification scheme for low-rank SCFTs incorporating vertex algebra techniques.</description>

      <title>Semifinite von Neumann algebras in gauge theory and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: von Neumann algebras have been playing an increasingly important role in the context of gauge theories and gravity. The crossed product presents a natural method for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering it a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product of a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which means that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field theories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness of the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group containing the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies the centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide evidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we construct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We comment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion physics in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal theoretical model of instabilities in swirling flows occurring in nature or industrial processes is developed. This model encompasses various open and confined flows including spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow, which results from the combination of differential rotation and baroclinic convection due to radial heating and natural gravity. Utilizing short-wavelength local analysis, the model generalizes previous results from numerical simulations and linear stability analysis of specific flows. A general criterion for instability is derived, incorporating viscous dissipation and thermal diffusion, thereby extending and uniting existing criteria (Rayleigh for centrifugally-driven flows, L\"udwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson for isothermal spiraling flows, and Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke for non-isothermal azimuthal flows).</description>

Abstract: We give a classification of the $regular$ soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy, referred to as the $KP solitons$, under the Gel'fand-Dickey $\ell$-reductions in terms of the permutation of the symmetric group. As an example, we show that the regular soliton solutions of the (good) Boussinesq equation as the 3-reduction can have $at ~most$ one resonant soliton in addition to two sets of solitons propagating in opposite directions. We also give a systematic construction of these soliton solutions for the $\ell$-reductions using the vertex operators. In particular, we show that the $non-crossing$ permutation gives the regularity condition for the soliton solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified analog quantum simulation protocol for preparing quantum states that embed solutions of parabolic partial differential equations, including the heat, Black-Scholes and Fokker-Planck equations. The key idea is to approximate the heat equations by a system of hyperbolic heat equations that involve only first-order differential operators. This scheme requires relatively simple interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, which are the electric and magnetic dipole moment-like interaction terms that would be present in a Jaynes-Cummings-like model. For a d-dimensional problem, we show that it is much more appropriate to use a single d-level quantum system - a qudit - instead of its qubit counterpart, and d+1 qumodes. The total resource cost is efficient in d and precision error, and has potential for realisability for instance in cavity and circuit QED systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose a numerical algorithm to compute the intensity and polarization of a polychromatic electromagnetic radiation crossing a medium with graded refractive index and modeled by the Vector Radiative Refractive Transfer Equations (VRRTE). Special attention is given to the case where the refractive index has a discontinuity for which the Fresnel conditions are necessary. We assume that the only spatial variable of interest is the altitude (stratified medium). An algorithm based on iterations of the sources is shown to be monotone and convergent. Numerical examples are given with highly varying absorption coefficient kappa and Rayleigh scattering as in the Earth atmosphere. To study the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere kappa is changed in the frequency ranges where CO2 is absorbing.</description>

      <title>The space of Hardy-weights for quasilinear operators on discrete graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Hardy inequalities for $p$-Schr\"odinger operators on general weighted graphs. Specifically, we prove a Maz'ya-type result, where we characterize the space of Hardy weights for $ p $-Schr\"odinger operators via a generalized capacity. The novel ingredient in the proof is the demonstration that the simplified energy of the $ p $-Schr\"odinger energy functional is compatible with certain normal contractions. As a consequence, we obtain a necessary integrability criterion for Hardy weights. Finally, using some tools of criticality theory, we investigate the existence of minimizers in the Hardy inequalities and discuss relations to Cheeger type estimates.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spheres are among the most studied examples of compact quantum spaces, described by C*-algebras which are Cuntz-Krieger algebras of a directed graph, as proved by Hong and Szyma\'nski in 2002. About five years earlier, in 1997, Sheu proved that the C*-algebra of a quantum sphere is a groupoid C*-algebra. Here we show that the path groupoid of the directed graph of Hong and Szyma\'nski is isomorphic to the groupoid discovered by Sheu.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the $\phi^4_1$ measure in the sharp interface limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $\phi^4_1$ measure in an interval of length $\ell$, defined by a symmetric double-well potential $W$ and inverse temperature $\beta$. Our results concern its asymptotic behavior in the joint limit $\beta, \ell \to \infty$, both in the subcritical regime $\ell \ll \rme^{\beta C_W}$ and in the supercritical regime $\ell \gg \rme^{\beta C_W}$, where $C_W$ denotes the surface tension. In the former case, in which the measure concentrates on the pure phases, we prove the corresponding large deviation principle. The associated rate function is the Modica-Mortola functional modified to take into account the entropy of the locations of the interfaces. Further, we provide the sharp asymptotics of the probability of having a given number of transitions between the two pure phases. In the supercritical regime, the measure does not longer concentrate and we show that the interfaces are asymptotically distributed according to a Poisson point process.</description>

      <title>Some properties of a non-hydrostatic stochastic oceanic primitive equations model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how relaxing the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis affects theoretical aspects of the LU primitive equations well-posedness. We focus on models that sit between incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and standard LU primitive equations, aiming for numerical manageability while capturing non-hydrostatic phenomena. Our main result concerns the well-posedness of a specific stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations. This holds with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, and when the horizontal component of noise is independent of z. In fact these conditions can be related to the dynamical regime in which the primitive equations remain valid. Moreover, under these conditions, we show that the LU primitive equations solution tends toward the one of the deterministic primitive equations for a vanishing noise, thus providing a physical coherence to the LU stochastic model.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Calculus Approach to Boltzmann Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Monte Carlo methods for particle transport utilize source iteration to express the solution, the flux density, of the transport equation as a Neumann series. Our contribution is to show that the particle paths simulated within source iteration are associated with the adjoint flux density and the adjoint particle paths are associated with the flux density. We make our assertion rigorous through the use of stochastic calculus by representing the particle path used in source iteration as a solution to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The solution to the adjoint Boltzmann equation is then expressed in terms of the same SDE and the solution to the Boltzmann equation is expressed in terms of the SDE associated with the adjoint particle process. An important consequence is that the particle paths used within source iteration simultaneously provide Monte Carlo approximations of the flux density and adjoint flux density. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to support the simultaneous use of the particle paths.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Matching the Self-Consistent Expansion to Approximate the Modified Bessel Functions of the Second Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-consistent expansion (SCE) is a powerful technique for obtaining perturbative solutions to problems in statistical physics but it suffers from a subtle problem - too much freedom! The SCE can be used to generate an enormous number of approximations but distinguishing the superb approximations from the deficient ones can only be achieved after the fact by comparison to experimental or numerical results. Here, we propose a method of using the SCE to a priori obtain uniform approximations, namely asymptotic matching. If the asymptotic behaviour of a problem can be identified, then the approximations generated by the SCE can be tuned to asymptotically match the desired behaviour and this can be used to obtain uniform approximations over the entire domain of consideration, without needing to resort to empirical comparisons. We demonstrate this method by applying it to the task of obtaining uniform approximations of the modified Bessel functions of the second kind, $K_\alpha(x)$.</description>

      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce (symmetric) Tetranacci polynomials $\xi_j$ as a twofold generalization of ordinary Tetranacci numbers, by considering both non unity coefficients and generic initial values in their recursive definition. The issue of these polynomials arose in condensed matter physics and the diagonalization of symmetric Toeplitz matrices having in total four non-zero off diagonals. For the latter, the symmetric Tetranacci polynomials are the basic entities of the associated eigenvectors; thus, treating the recursive structure determines the eigenvalues as well. Subsequently, we present a complete closed form expression for any symmetric Tetranacci polynomial. The key feature is a decomposition in terms of generalized Fibonacci polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We study the BCS critical temperature on half-spaces in dimensions $d=1,2,3$ with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that the critical temperature on a half-space is strictly higher than on $\mathbb{R}^d$, at least at weak coupling in $d=1,2$ and weak coupling and small chemical potential in $d=3$. Furthermore, we show that the relative shift in critical temperature vanishes in the weak coupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the notions of particular integral and particular integrability, in classical mechanics, under a geometrical approach. For Hamiltonian systems on cosymplectic, contact and cocontact manifolds, it is demonstrated that the existence of a particular integral implies that some of the trajectories can be found from a simpler reduced set of Hamilton equations. In the case of particular integrability, these trajectories can be obtained by quadratures. For dissipative systems described using contact geometry, a particular integral can be viewed as a generalization of the important concept of dissipated quantity as well.</description>

Abstract: We provide a framework to classify hyperbolic monopoles with continuous symmetries and find a Structure Theorem, greatly simplifying the construction of all those with spherically symmetry. In doing so, we reduce the problem of finding spherically symmetric hyperbolic monopoles to a problem in representation theory. Additionally, we determine constraints on the structure groups of such monopoles. Using these results, we construct novel spherically symmetric $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$ hyperbolic monopoles.</description>

Abstract: In general relativity, time functions are crucial objects whose existence and properties are intimately tied to the causal structure of a spacetime and also to the initial value formulation of the Einstein equations. In this work we establish all fundamental classical existence results on time functions in the setting of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces (including causally plain continuous spacetimes, closed cone fields and even more singular spaces). More precisely, we characterize the existence of time functions by $K$-causality, show that a modified notion of Geroch's volume functions are time functions if and only if the space is causally continuous, and lastly, characterize global hyperbolicity by the existence of Cauchy time functions, and Cauchy sets. Our results thus inevitably show that no manifold structure is needed in order to obtain suitable time functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-classically equivalent field theories are related by a quasi-isomorphism between their underlying $L_\infty$-algebras, but such a quasi-isomorphism is not necessarily a homotopy transfer. We demonstrate that all quasi-isomorphisms can be lifted to spans of $L_\infty$-algebras in which the quasi-isomorphic $L_\infty$-algebras are obtained from a correspondence $L_\infty$-algebra by a homotopy transfer. Our construction is very useful: homotopy transfer is computationally tractable, and physically, it amounts to integrating out fields in a Feynman diagram expansion. Spans of $L_\infty$-algebras allow for a clean definition of quasi-isomorphisms of cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras. Furthermore, they appear naturally in many contexts within physics. As examples, we first consider scalar field theory with interaction vertices blown up in different ways. We then show that (non-Abelian) T-duality can be seen as a span of $L_\infty$-algebras, and we provide full details in the case of the principal chiral model. We also present the relevant span of $L_\infty$-algebras for the Penrose-Ward transform in the context of self-dual Yang-Mills theory and Bogomolny monopoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical embeddability problem asks whether a given stochastic matrix $T$, describing transition probabilities of a $d$-level system, can arise from the underlying homogeneous continuous-time Markov process. Here, we investigate the quantum version of this problem, asking of the existence of a Markovian quantum channel generating state transitions described by a given $T$. More precisely, we aim at characterising the set of quantum-embeddable stochastic matrices that arise from memoryless continuous-time quantum evolution. To this end, we derive both upper and lower bounds on that set, providing new families of stochastic matrices that are quantum-embeddable but not classically-embeddable, as well as families of stochastic matrices that are not quantum-embeddable. As a result, we demonstrate that a larger set of transition matrices can be explained by memoryless models if the dynamics is allowed to be quantum, but we also identify a non-zero measure set of random processes that cannot be explained by either classical or quantum memoryless dynamics. Finally, we fully characterise extreme stochastic matrices (with entries given only by zeros and ones) that are quantum-embeddable.</description>

Abstract: We solve "half" the problem of finding three-dimensional quasisymmetric magnetic fields that do not necessarily satisfy force balance. This involves determining which hidden symmetries are admissible as quasisymmetries, and then showing explicitly how to construct quasisymmetric magnetic fields given an admissible symmetry. The admissibility conditions take the form of a system of overdetermined nonlinear partial differential equations involving second derivatives of the symmetry's infinitesimal generator.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Persistent and anti-Persistent Motion in Bounded and Unbounded Space: Resolution of the First-Passage Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of temporal correlations in random movement trajectories is a widespread phenomenon across biological, chemical and physical systems. The ubiquity of persistent and anti-persistent motion in many natural and synthetic systems has led to a large literature on the modelling of temporally correlated movement paths. Despite the substantial body of work, little progress has been made to determine the dynamical properties of various transport related quantities, including the first-passage or first-hitting probability to one or multiple absorbing targets when space is bounded. To bridge this knowledge gap we generalise the renewal theory of first-passage and splitting probabilities to correlated discrete variables. We do so in arbitrary dimensions on a lattice for the so-called correlated or persistent random walk, the one step non-Markovian extension of the simple lattice random walk in bounded and unbounded space. We focus on bounded domains and consider both persistent and anti-persistent motion in hypercubic lattices as well as the hexagonal lattice. The discrete formalism allows us to extend the notion of the first-passage to that of the directional first-passage, whereby the walker must reach the target from a prescribed direction for a hitting event to occur. As an application to spatio-temporal observations of correlated moving cells that may be either repelled or attracted to hard surfaces, we compare the first-passage statistics to a target within a reflecting domain depending on whether an interaction with the reflective interface invokes a reversal of the movement direction or not. With strong persistence we observe multi-modality in the first-passage distribution in the former case, which instead is greatly suppressed in the latter.</description>

      <title>Non Gaussian statistics in static and dynamic Galton boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbing the arrangements of pegs on a static Galton board can result in non-trivial stationary distributions, which in the continuum limit correspond to departure from regular gaussian behavior. Two such distributions are obtained. Further, the distributions generated for a dynamic galton board under external forcing in a general direction are obtained by solution of the corresponding stochastic differential equations. Exact cumulant generating functions for the distribution are presented for forcing in one dimension. An approximate expression, correct to first order in the forcing amplitude, is presented for the case of two dimensions. Both cases show nontrivial departures from the static gaussian solution.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter aims to advance unexplored properties of a new class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity, reported in Universe 9, 467 (2023) and Eur.$\,$Phys.$\,$J.$\,$C 83, 626 (2023). Therein, it was shown that when the Weak Energy Condition is violated, the topology of spacetime in scalar-tensor gravity is altered, enabling the formation of two-way traversable wormholes. Furthermore, each of these wormholes acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>
