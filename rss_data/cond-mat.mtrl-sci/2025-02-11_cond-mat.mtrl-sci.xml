      <title>Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Modeling Amorphous and Amorphous Porous Palladium: A Deep Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous and amorphous porous palladium are key materials for catalysis, hydrogen storage, and functional applications, but their complex structures present computational challenges. This study employs a deep neural network trained on 33,310 atomic configurations from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to model their interatomic potential. The AI-driven approach accurately predicts structural and thermal properties while significantly reducing computational costs. Validation against density functional theory confirms its reliability in reproducing forces, energies, and structural distributions. These findings highlight AI's potential in accelerating the study of amorphous materials and advancing their applications in energy and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Structural Modulation and Enhanced Magnetic Ordering in Incommensurate K$_{1-{x}}$CrSe$_2$ Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered delafossite-type compounds and related transition metal dichalcogenides, characterized by their triangular net structures, serve as prototypical systems for exploring the intricate interplay between crystal structure and magnetic behavior. Herein, we report on the discovery of the compound K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ ($x \approx$ 0.13), an incommensurately modulated phase. Single crystals of this compound were grown for the first time using a K/Se self-flux. We find a monoclinic crystal structure with incommensurate modulation, that can be rationalized by a 3+1 dimensional model. This modulation compensates for the under-stoichiometry of K cations, creating pronounced undulations in the CrSe$_2$ layers. Our anisotropic magnetization measurements reveal that K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ undergoes a transition to a long-range magnetically ordered state below $T_{\mathrm N}$ = 133 K, a temperature 1.6 to 3.3 times higher than in earlier reported KCrSe$_2$ compounds. Our findings open new avenues for tuning the magnetic properties of these layered materials through structural modulation.</description>

      <title>Magnon-phonon interactions from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-guided construction of an analytic kinetic energy functional for orbital free density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) of kinetic energy functionals (KEF) for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) holds the promise of addressing an important bottleneck in large-scale ab initio materials modeling where sufficiently accurate analytic KEFs are lacking. However, ML models are not as easily handled as analytic expressions; they need to be provided in the form of algorithms and associated data. Here, we bridge the two approaches and construct an analytic expression for a KEF guided by interpretative machine learning of crystal cell-averaged kinetic energy densities ({\tau}) of several hundred materials. A previously published dataset including multiple phases of 433 unary, binary, and ternary compounds containing Li, Al, Mg, Si, As, Ga, Sb, Na, Sn, P, and In was used for training, including data at the equilibrium geometry as well as strained structures. A hybrid Gaussian process regression - neural network (GPR-NN) method was used to understand the type of functional dependence of {\tau} on the features which contained cell-averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the product of the electron density and Kohn-Sham effective potential. Based on this analysis, an analytic model is constructed that can reproduce Kohn-Sham DFT energy-volume curves with sufficient accuracy (pronounced minima that are sufficiently close to the minima of the Kohn-Sham DFT-based curves and with sufficiently close curvatures) to enable structure optimizations and elastic response calculations.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of self-powered photodetector materials based on Ni-doped ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Prospects for market-specific design of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for optimal perovskite for tandem cell configurations is challenging as it involves several factors ranging from device level performance under field conditions to degradation rates and cost. Here, we first show that the traditional detailed balance or Shockley-Queisser (SQ) analysis leads to a stringent as well as unoptimized selection criteria for top cell perovskite. On the other hand, through detailed numerical simulations of the annual energy yield, well calibrated with recent temperature dependent experimental results, we identify geographic location-specific criteria for selecting optimal top cell perovskites. Our simulations indicate that, for certain degradation rates, a broad range of perovskite materials could yield comparable levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) - in contrast to the traditional detailed balance analysis. Our quantitative analysis shows that the optimal choice of perovskites indeed depends on the geographic location and relative degradation rate thus elucidating the prospects for market-specific design of P/Si tandem solar cells.</description>

      <title>Stark Shift from Quantum Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information applications, owing to their efficient and bright single photon emission. Despite the challenges in directly characterizing these emitters, the interaction between external fields and defects, such as the Stark shift, offers valuable insights into their local geometric configurations. In this study, we focus on clarifying the possible origin of the distinct Stark shift characteristics observed experimentally, particularly in the emission range around 2 eV. We find that the local symmetry of the defects plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the Stark shift, which can be either linear or quadratic. Additionally, the local dielectric environment significantly influences the Stark shift response. Our calculations not only enhance the understanding of the micro-structure of these hitherto unknown emitters but also pave the way for their more effective utilization as single-photon sources and qubits in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization and Force Error Correction of Neuroevolution Potential for Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Wurtzite GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a representative of wide-bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has been widely utilized in high-power devices due to high breakdown voltage and low specific on resistance. Accurate prediction of wurtzite GaN thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for designing effective thermal management systems of electronic applications. Machine learning driven molecular dynamics simulation offers a promising approach to predicting the thermal conductivity of large-scale systems without requiring predefined parameters. However, these methods often underestimate the thermal conductivity of materials with inherently high thermal conductivity due to the large predicted force error compared with first-principle calculation, posing a critical challenge for their broader application. In this study, we successfully developed a neuroevolution potential for wurtzite GaN and accurately predicted its thermal conductivity, 259 W/m-K at room temperatue, achieving excellent agreement with reported experimental measurements. The hyperparameters of neuroevolution potential (NEP) were optimized based on systematic analysis of reproduced energy and force, structural feature, computational efficiency. Furthermore, a force prediction error correction method was implemented, effectively reducing the error caused by the additional force noise in the Langevin thermostat by extrapolating to the zero-force error limit. This study provides valuable insights and hold significant implication for advancing efficient thermal management technologies in wide bandgap semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Softening of Vibrational Modes and Anharmonicity Induced Thermal Conductivity Reduction in a-Si:H at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has garnered considerable attention in the semiconductor industry, particularly for its use in solar cells and passivation layers for high performance silicon solar cells, owing to its exceptional photoelectric properties and scalable manufacturing processes. A comprehensive understanding of thermal transport mechanism in a-Si:H is essential for optimizing thermal management and ensuring the reliable operation of these devices. In this study, we developed a neuroevolution machine learning potential based on first-principles calculations of energy, forces, and virial, which enables accurate modeling of interatomic interactions in both a-Si:H and a-Si systems. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method, we systematically investigated the thermal conductivity of a-Si:H and a-Si across a temperature range of 300-1000 K and hydrogen concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 at%. Our simulation results found that thermal conductivity of a-Si:H with 12 at% hydrogen was significantly reduced by 12% compared to that of a-Si at 300 K. We analyzed the spectral thermal conductivity, vibrational density of states and lifetimes of vibrational modes, and revealed the softening of vibrational modes and anharmonicity effects contribute to the reduction of thermal conductivity as temperature and hydrogen concentration increase. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen concentration and temperature on diffuson and propagon contribution to thermal conductivity of a-Si:H was revealed. This study provides valuable insights for developing thermal management strategies in silicon-based semiconducting devices and advances the understanding of thermal transport in amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in parallel-assembled single-atomic magnetic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently attracted significant interest in three- and two-dimensional materials, yet its realization in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) materials remains largely unexplored due to stringent symmetry constraints. Here, we systematically investigated the emergence of altermagnetism in 30 Q1D monolayer prototypes, self-assembled from intra-chain anti-ferrimagnetically coupled \(XY_n\) single-atomic magnetic chains, using symmetry analysis and high-throughput density functional theory calculations. Symmetry analysis identifies four structural prototypes capable of hosting altermagnetism, which expand to 192 monolayers upon materialization. Our calculations further reveal eight dynamically stable Q1D altermagnets, all belonging to the AA-stacked intra-chain AFM coupled \(\beta\)-\(XY_3\) prototype, exhibiting \(d\)-wave-like spin splitting. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of altermagnetic properties by varying inter-chain spacing and applying external electric fields. By optimizing these parameters, altermagnetism can be significantly enhanced, with spin splitting reaching several hundred meV in CoTe\(_3\), or substantially suppressed, leading to a transition to a nodal-line semiconducting state in CrCl\(_3\). These findings establish a diverse and highly tunable family of Q1D altermagnetic candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast X-ray induced damage and nonthermal melting in cadmium sulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cadmium sulfide is a valuable material for solar cells, photovoltaic, and radiation detectors. It is thus important to evaluate the material damage mechanisms and damage threshold in response to irradiation. Here, we simulate the ultrafast XUV/X-ray irradiation of CdS with the combined model, XTANT-3. It accounts for nonequilibrium electronic and atomic dynamics, nonadiabatic coupling between the two systems, nonthermal melting and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. We find that the two phases of CdS, zinc blende and wurtzite, demonstrate very close damage threshold dose of ~0.4-0.5 eV/atom. The damage is mainly thermal, whereas with increase of the dose, nonthermal effects begin to dominate leading to nonthermal melting. The transient disordered state is a high-density liquid, which may be semiconducting or metallic depending on the dose. Later recrystallization may recover the material back to the crystalline phase, or at high doses create an amorphous phase with variable bandgap. The revealed effects may potentially allow for controllable tuning of the band gap via laser irradiation of CdS.</description>

      <title>Achieving electrode smoothing by controlling the nucleation phase of metal deposition through polymer-substrate binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems currently investigated for energy storage applications. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on copper (Cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near-surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate, but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.</description>

      <title>Vortices and antivortices in antiferroelectric PbZrO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although ferroelectric materials are characterised by their parallel arrangement of electric dipoles, in the right boundary conditions these dipoles can reorganize themselves into vortices, antivortices and other non-trivial topological structures. By contrast, little is known about how (or whether) antiferroelectrics, which are materials showing an antiparallel arrangement of electric dipoles, can exhibit vortices or antivortices. In this study, using advanced aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we uncover the existence of atomic-scale (anti)vorticity in ferroelastic domain walls of the archetypal antiferroelectric phase of PbZrO3. The finding is supported, and its underlying physics is explained, using both second-principles simulations based on a deep-learning interatomic potential, and continuum field modelling. This discovery expands the field of chiral topologies into antiferroelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presence of excitons significantly influence the optoelectronic properties and potential applications of materials. Using combined theoretical and experimental tools, we investigate the absorption spectra of $d^0$ double perovskite oxides Ba$_{2}$Y$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Nb, Ta, Sb), Ba$_{2}$Sc$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Ta, Sb) and $A_{2}$ScSbO$_6$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, Ba), allowing for a systematic variation of composition. We not only show that low-energy excitons are present in the visible range in {\it all} the considered so-called wide-gap insulators, but also that the nature and properties of these exciton modes differ from those in double perovskite halides as well as perovskite oxides. We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a detailed and comparative analysis of the electronic structure. Further, our findings elucidate possible correlations between the exciton properties and the composition, via the electronic structure, towards a comprehensive understanding of correlation effects and rational design principles.</description>

      <title>High pressure structural and lattice dynamics study of {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$has been studied using a concomitant in-situ synchrotron angle dispersive powder x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy study in a diamond anvil cell up to 60+ GPa, at room temperature. Helium, that remains fairly hydrostatic up to the highest pressure in this study, was used as the pressure-transmitting medium. The results from both experimental methods reveal a pressure-induced structural phase transition from $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ to a monoclinic $\beta$'-In2Se3 structure at $\approx$1 GPa, in agreement with previous studies. Based on our detailed measurements using both experimental techniques and F-f formalism, the $\beta$'-In$_2$Se$_3$ structure remains stable up to 45 GPa, without a clear indication of a phase transition towards the previously reported $\beta$-In2Se3 phase. Above this pressure, In$_2$Se$_3$ adopts a disordered solid-solution-like orthorhombic structure, phase IV. The results are discussed in comparison with the relevant previous studies of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ under pressure.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in Prussian Blue Analogues via growth--guided local ordering of hexacyanometallate vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Growth--Guided Local Ordering, a novel mechanism of symmetry reduction in disordered crystals. This mechanism operates through the directional ordering of point defects during crystal growth, where defect correlations develop preferentially along the growth direction, resulting in reduced symmetry that persists in the final structure through the spatial distribution of defects. We demonstrate this phenomenon in Mn[Co]-Prussian Blue Analogues, disordered cyanide crystals containing numerous Co(CN)$_6$ vacancies. Single crystal diffuse scattering reveals pronounced anisotropy in vacancy distribution: strong correlations along [001] growth direction contrast with weak correlations perpendicular to it. This local ordering reduces the Laue symmetry to tetragonal $4/mmm$, evident in properties such as birefringence, while the average structure retains cubic $m\bar 3m$ symmetry. When growth proceeds along [111] direction, the same mechanism produces domains with trigonal symmetry. Because this mechanism relies on fundamental aspects of crystal growth rather than specific material properties, it offers a general strategy for symmetry control in disordered crystals. Crucially, it transforms the complex task of altering crystal symmetry into the more manageable challenge of controlling growth direction, achievable through various established techniques such as the use of surfactants during crystallization.</description>

      <title>Various Architectures of Colloidal Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9; Thermal Stability, Photoluminescence and Magnetic Properties of Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9 Nanosheets</title>

Abstract: The lindgrenite compounds [Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2] with various architectures and high crystallinity were prepared by a simple surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method. Then, the Cu3Mo2O9 samples were prepared by calcination of the as-synthesized Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2. The resulting samples have high crystallinity, colloidal properties, high-yield, large-scale production capability with using of nontoxic and inexpensive reagents and water as an environmentally solvent. The scanning electron microscope studies show that the as-prepared lindgrenite nanostructures are well crystallized with rod, sheet and hollow sphere morphologies. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence and magnetic properties of the nanosheet samples have been investigated that the both of Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9 samples have super paramagnetic behavior at room temperature and in comparison with previous works, Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9 samples synthesized by the surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method in this work have a very obvious red-shifted PL emission and high intensity.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of nonlinear Hall effect in Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), as an important probe to reveal the symmetry breaking in topological properties of materials, opens up a new dimension for exploring the energy band structure and electron transport mechanism of quantum materials. Current studies mainly focus on the observation of material intrinsic the NLHE or inducing the NLHE response by artificially constructing corrugated/twisted twodimensionalmaterial systems. Notably, the modulation of NLHE signal strength, a core parameter of device performance, has attracted much attention, while theoretical predictions suggest that an applied electric field can achieve the NLHE enhancement through modulation of the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). Here we report effective modulation the magnitude and sign of the NLHE by applying additional constant electric fields of different directions and magnitudes in the semimetal TaIrTe4. The NLHE response strength is enhanced by 168 times compared to the intrinsic one at 4 K when the additional constant electric field of -0.5 kV/cm is applied to the b-axis of TaIrTe4 and the through a.c. current is parallel to the TaIrTe4 a-axis. Scaling law analysis suggests that the enhancement may be the result of the combined effect of the electric field on the intrinsic BCD and disorder scattering effect of TaIrTe4. This work provides a means to study the properties of TaIrTe4, as well as a valuable reference for the study of novel electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Allegro-FM: Towards Equivariant Foundation Model for Exascale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a foundation model for exascale molecular dynamics simulations by leveraging an E(3) equivariant network architecture (Allegro) and a set of large-scale organic and inorganic materials datasets merged by Total Energy Alignment (TEA) framework. Thanks to the large-scale training sets, the obtained model (Allegro-FM) is versatile for various materials simulations for diverse downstream tasks covering 89 elements in the periodic table. Allegro-FM exhibits excellent agreements with high-level quantum chemistry theories in describing structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties, while exhibiting emergent capabilities for structural correlations, reaction kinetics, mechanical strengths, fracture, and solid/liquid dissolution, for which the model has not been trained. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust predictability and generalizability of Allegro-FM for chemical reactions using the transition1x that consists of 9.1 million transition state data, as well as calcium silicate hydrates as a testbed. With its computationally efficient, strictly-local network architecture, Allegro-FM scales up to multi-billion-atom systems with a parallel efficiency of 0.964 on the exaflop/s Aurora supercomputer at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. The approach presented in this work demonstrates the potential of the foundation model for a novel materials design and discovery based on large-scale atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Fe-Ag and Ag-Fe Interfaces in Ag-57Fe-Ag trilayer Using Nuclear Resonance Scattering under X-ray Standing Wave Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interfaces of layered nanostructures is key to optimizing their structural and magnetic properties for the desired functionality. In the present work, the two interfaces of a few nm thick Fe layer in Ag-57Fe-Ag trilayers are studied with a depth resolution of a fraction of a nanometer using x-ray standing waves (XSWs) generated by an underlying [W-Si]x10 multilayer (MLT) at an x-ray incident angle around the Bragg peak of the MLT. Interface selectivity in Ag-57Fe-Ag trilayers was achieved by moving XSW antinodes across the interfaces by optimizing suitable incident angles and performing depth-resolved nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements for magnetic and structural properties. The combined analysis revealed that the rms roughness of 57Fe-on-Ag and Ag-on-57Fe interfaces are not equal. The roughness of the 57Fe-on-Ag interface is 10 Angstrom, while that of the Ag-on-57Fe interface is 6 Angstrom. 57Fe isotope sensitive NRS revealed that hyperfine field (HFF) at both interfaces of 57Fe-on-Ag and Ag-on-57Fe interfaces are distinct, which is consistent with the difference in interface roughnesses measured as root mean square (RMS) roughness. Thermal annealing induces 57Fe diffusion into the Ag layer, and annealing at 325 C transforms the sample into a paramagnetic state. This behavior is attributed to forming 57Fe nanoparticles within the Ag matrix, exhibiting a paramagnetic nature. These findings provide deep insights into interface properties crucial for developing advanced nanostructures and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of a $Pbca$ phase and robust metallicity in $\rm{RuO_2}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\rm{RuO_2}$ stands as a quintessential rutile-type compound under ambient conditions, with its structural exploration under pressure bearing significant implications for both phase transition investigations and Earth science. Nonetheless, the precise phase transition sequence remains a debate. In this study, we disclose the emergence of the $Pbca$ phase alongside the enduring metallic character of $\rm{RuO_2}$ under megabar pressure. Employing state-of-the-art synchrotron X-ray diffraction, our observations delineate a phase transition trajectory progressing through rutile, $\rm{CaCl_2}$, and ultimately $Pbca$ phases. Notably, the $Pbca$ phase manifests immediately just after the rutile-$\rm{CaCl_2}$ transition, confining a narrow pressure regime for the pure $\rm{CaCl_2}$-type phase. Within the pressure range of 15.5 to 35.0 GPa, a coexistence of the $\rm{CaCl_2}$-type and $Pbca$ phases is observed, transforming to a sole presence of the $Pbca$ phase beyond 35.0 GPa. Electrical transport measurements conducted on both single crystal and powder samples confirm the enduring metallic conductivity of $\rm{RuO_2}$, persisting up to at least $\sim$120 GPa, albeit exhibiting a diminished conductivity at ultrahigh pressures due to a reduction in electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This study furnishes compelling evidence for the presence of the $Pbca$ phase across a broad pressure range, diverging from the previously widely acknowledged $Pa\bar{3}$ phase, thereby offering crucial insights into phase transition phenomena in other metal dioxides and advancing our comprehension of electronic behaviors within 4d and 5d electron systems.</description>

      <title>A physics-based data-driven model for CO$_2$ gas diffusion electrodes to drive automated laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrochemical reduction of atmospheric CO$_2$ into high-energy molecules with renewable energy is a promising avenue for energy storage that can take advantage of existing infrastructure especially in areas where sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels do not exist. Automated laboratories are currently being developed and used to optimize the composition and operating conditions of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), the device in which this reaction takes place. Improving the efficiency of GDEs is crucial for this technology to become viable. Here we present a modeling framework to efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space of GDE designs in an active learning context. At the core of the framework is an uncertainty-aware physics model calibrated with experimental data. The model has the flexibility to capture various input parameter spaces and any carbon products which can be modeled with Tafel kinetics. It is interpretable, and a Gaussian process layer can capture deviations of real data from the function space of the physical model itself. We deploy the model in a simulated active learning setup with real electrochemical data gathered by the AdaCarbon automated laboratory and show that it can be used to efficiently traverse the multi-dimensional parameter space.</description>

      <title>Engineering of electronic and magnetic modulations in gradient functional oxide heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced interface engineering provides a way to control the ground state of correlated oxide heterostructures, which enables the shaping of future electronic and magnetic nanodevices with enhanced performance. An especially promising and rather new avenue is to find and explore low-dimensional phases of structural, ferroic and superconducting origin. In this multimodal study, we present a novel dynamic growth control method that enables synthesizing compositionally graded superlattices (SLs) of (LaMnO_3)_10/(SrMnO_3)_10 (LMO/SMO), in which the layers gradually change their composition between LMO and SMO with gradient G values ranging from 0 to 100 %. This leads to strong modulations in the material's electronic properties and of the two-phase ferromagnetic (FM) behavior. In particular, we observe that G has almost no impact on the emergent high-temperature FM phase; in contrast, the low-temperature volume-like FM phase increases drastically with higher G-factors and thus can serve as a precise marker for chemical composition on a nanoscale. Focusing on the interfacial charge transfer found at sharp SMO/LMO interfaces (G=0), we observe that for higher G-factors a long-range charge modulation develops, which is accompanied by an insulator-to-metal transition. These findings showcase G as a crucial control parameter that can shape the superlattice's intrinsic properties and provide a perspective for designing functional oxide heterostructures with artificially disordered interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the first principles description of coherent phonons in systems subjected to optical excitations and/or doping. We reformulate the first-principles Ehrenfest equation (fpEE) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 031026 (2023)] in terms of Born-Oppenheimer phonon frequencies and identify key simplifications that lead to current models. Our main findings are that the conventional equation of motion for coherent phonons needs revision, as it does not arise from the fpEE, and that the $e$-$ph$ coupling should be replaced by an unconventional dynamically screened coupling. The fpEE is also used to develop a first-principles polaron theory of lattice distortions.</description>

      <title>Silica Aerogel Thin Film on Improving Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica aerogels are nanoporous materials with exceptional optical and physical properties, making them promising candidates to enhance solar cell efficiency as antireflective coatings. This study synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogel thin films under ambient conditions and characterized their porous structure, surface morphology, and optical performance. The films were deposited on monocrystalline silicon solar cells to assess their impact on photovoltaic properties. A two-step acid/base catalyzed sol-gel process was utilized, followed by solvent exchange and surface modification with trimethylchlorosilane. Structural analysis via SEM revealed successful deposition of crack-free films when aging occurred in an ethanol environment. The aerogel displayed considerable specific surface area (115 m2/g), porosity (77.92%), and surface roughness (55-78%) along with a low refractive index (1.05), benefiting light harvesting. Preliminary solar testing showed increased output voltage with a 0.2 mm aerogel coating versus a bare cell. Further IV measurements demonstrated enhanced charge transport and conversion efficiency for the treated cell. The antireflective and light-trapping effects of aerogel appear to improve photon absorption. This initial research validates the potential of ambient pressure-synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogels to increase the performance of silicon photovoltaics cost-effectively. Further optimization of film thickness and morphology could realize higher efficiency gains.</description>

Abstract: We employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and circular-dichroism ARPES to systematically investigate the spin texture of Sb-doped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our results display a hedgehog-like spin texture in this system which is signified by reversed-orienting out-of-plane spins at the Dirac gap. Our finding reveals the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking, implying the possibility for realization of high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Ground state properties of a spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet NH$_{4}$Fe(PO$_{3}$F)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural and magnetic properties of a two-dimensional spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet NH$_{4}$Fe(PO$_{3}$F)$_2$ are explored via x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, high-field magnetization, heat capacity, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on a polycrystalline sample. The compound portrays distorted triangular units of the Fe$^{3+}$ ions with anisotropic bond lengths. The magnetic susceptibility shows a broad maxima around $T^{\rm{max}}_{\chi}\simeq 12$ K, mimicking the short-range antiferromagnetic order of a low-dimensional spin system. The magnetic susceptibility and NMR shift could be modeled assuming the spin-$5/2$ isotropic triangular lattice model and the average value of the exchange coupling is estimated to be $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 1.7$ K. This value of the exchange coupling is reproduced well from the saturation field of the pulse field data. It shows the onset of a magnetic ordering at $T_{\rm N} \simeq 5.7$ K, setting the frustration ratio of $f = \frac{|\theta_{\rm CW}|}{T_{\rm N}} \simeq 5.7$. Such a value of $f$ reflects moderate magnetic frustration in the compound. The d$M$/d$H$ vs $H$ plots of the low temperature magnetic isotherms exhibit a sharp peak at $H_{\rm SF} \simeq 1.45$ T, suggesting a field-induced spin-flop transition and magnetic anisotropy. The rectangular shape of the $^{31}$P NMR spectra below $T_{\rm N}$ unfolds that the ordering is commensurate antiferromagnet type. Three distinct phase regimes are clearly discerned in the $H - T$ phase diagram, redolent of a frustrated magnet with in-plane (XY-type) anisotropy.</description>

      <title>New opportunities for high pressure hydrogen achieved by fullerane vibrating modes: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The encapsulation of hydrogen within fullerene/fullerane cages offers a promising avenue for studying high pressure hydrogen dynamics. Through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the behavior of a system consisting of hydrogen atoms enclosed in a \ch{C20H20} dodecahedrane. Our findings reveal significant structural and dynamical changes as the cage undergoes compression, corresponding to radial symmetric vibration. We analyze geometric, energetic, and thermodynamic parameters, highlighting correlations and observing behavior analogous to high pressure phases of hydrogen. Notably, our study bridges the gap between theory and experiment by proposing a novel approach to achieving high pressures and temperatures experimentally. These results not only contribute to the understanding of hydrogen behavior under extreme conditions but also hold implications for the quest to attain metallic hydrogen - a milestone in materials science with potential applications in various fields.</description>

      <title>WyckoffDiff - A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.</description>

      <title>Resonant spin amplification and accumulation in MAPbI$_3$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologic and spintronic applications require reliable semiconducting materials that enable a significant, long-living spin polarization of electronic excitations and offer the ability to manipulate it optically in an external field. Due to the specifics of band structure and remarkable spin-dependent properties, the lead halide perovskite semiconductors are suitable candidates for that. Here, the carrier spin dynamics in a MAPbI$_3$ (MA = methylammonium) perovskite single crystal with thickness of 20 $\mu$m are studied by the time-resolved Kerr ellipticity technique at cryogenic temperatures. Long times of longitudinal electron spin relaxation $T_1 = 30$ ns and transverse electron spin dephasing $T_{2,e}^*=21$ ns are found. The spin dynamics lasting longer than the applied laser pulse repetition period give rise to spin accumulation effects. We exploit them through the resonant spin amplification, polarization recovery, and spin inertia techniques to study the electron and hole spin systems coupled with the nuclear spins. These results establish the lead halide perovskite semiconductors as suitable platform for quantum technologies relying on spin-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Formation of a 2D Adatom Gas on Cryogenic Li Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense electrostatic fields, such as those able to break bonds and cause field-ion emission, can fundamentally alter the behaviour of atoms at and on the surface. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the Li (110) surface under high electrostatic fields, we identify a critical field strength at which surface atoms occupying a kink site become thermodynamically unstable against adatom formation. This mechanism leads to the formation of a highly concentrated two-dimensional (2D) adatom gas on the surface. Moreover, the applied field reverses the stability of preferred adsorption sites, enabling barrierless diffusion of lithium atoms even well below the threshold required for field evaporation. The here identified mechanisms offer a unified explanation for experimental observations in atom probe tomography and for understanding high electric field phenomena in systems such as battery interfaces and electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>A Grain Boundary Embrittlement Genome for Substitutional Cubic Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary chemistry plays a critical role for the properties of metals and alloys, yet there is a lack of consistent datasets for alloy design and development. With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials science, open materials models and datasets can be used to overcome such challenges. Here, we use a universal interatomic potential to compute a grain boundary segregation and embrittlement genome for the {\Sigma}5[001](210) grain boundary for FCC and BCC binary alloys. The grain boundary database calculated here serves as a design tool for the embrittlement of high-angle grain boundaries for alloys across 15 base metals system of Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe (both BCC and FCC), Mo, Nb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ta, V and W with 75 solute elements for each.</description>

      <title>Topological Constraint Model of Alkaline Earth Vanadate Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological constraint theory has enabled the successful prediction of glass properties over a wide range of compositions. In this study, a topological constraint model is constructed for alkaline earth vanadate glasses based on experimental data. The change in vanadate structural units from VO5 to VO4 was modeled as a function of alkaline earth content and related to thermal and mechanical properties. The model covers both high and low-temperature properties to probe the temperature dependence of constraint rigidity for each constituent of the glass network. The model is changed to describe anomalies in magnesium sites potentially implying that magnesium can form locally rigid structures. Furthermore, the traditional understanding of vanadate glass structure is compared to recent results concluding that the terminal oxygen must exist as a part of the VO4 units. Results for the model explain that bridging oxygen constraints are the main contributors to network rigidity in both low and high temperature regimes. Vanadate glass networks are highly connected even with the introduction of modifier species, which introduce their own bond constraints. Corroboration between experimental data and the topological constraint model illustrates the role of alkaline earth oxides in the glass network.</description>

      <title>Magnons in chromium trihalides from \emph{ab initio} Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromium trihalides (CrX$_3$, with $\rm{X=I,Br,Cl}$) are layered ferromagnetic materials with rich physics and possible applications. Their structure consists of magnetic Cr atoms positioned between two layers of halide atoms. The choice of halide results in distinct magnetic properties, but their effect on spin-wave (magnon) excitations is not fully understood. Here we present first-principles calculations of magnon dispersions and wave functions for monolayer Cr trihalides using the finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to describe collective spin-flip excitations. % We study the dependence of magnon dispersions on the halide species and resolve the small topological gap at the Dirac point in the magnon spectrum by including spin-orbit coupling. Analysis of magnon wave functions reveals that magnons are made up of electronic transitions with a wider energy range than excitons in CrX$_3$ monolayers, providing insight into magnon states in real and reciprocal space. We discuss Heisenberg exchange parameters extracted from the BSE and discuss the convergence of BSE magnon calculations. Our work advances the quantitative modeling of magnons in two-dimensional materials, providing the starting point for studying magnon interactions in a first-principles BSE framework.</description>

      <title>Filling a gap in materials mechanics: Nanoindentation at high constant strain rates upto $10^5 s^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic behaviour of materials has long been a key focus in the field of high strain rate testing, and a critical yet unresolved question is whether flow stresses exhibit a significant strength upturn at strain rates ranging between $10^3$ and $10^4 s^{-1}$, and, if so, why. Current macro- and microscale mechanical testing is limited, as no single experimental method spans the entire strain rate range of $10^2$ to $10^5 s^{-1}$, where such an upturn is expected. In this study, we address these limitations using a highly customized piezoelectric in situ nanomechanical test setup, which enables, for the first time, constant indentation strain rates up to $10^5 s^{-1}$. This system was employed to investigate the rate-dependent hardness in single-crystalline molybdenum, nanocrystalline nickel, and amorphous fused silica across strain rates of $10^1$ to $10^5 s^{-1}$, remarkably revealing an upturn in hardness in all three materials. The constancy of strain rate allowed, post-deformation microstructural analysis specific to the tested strain rates, shedding light on the potential mechanisms causing the hardness upturn.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Symmetrization of Neural Network Solvers for the Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries into neural networks has been a cornerstone of success in many AI-for-science applications. Diagonal groups of isometries, which describe the invariance under a simultaneous movement of multiple objects, arise naturally in many-body quantum problems. Despite their importance, diagonal groups have received relatively little attention, as they lack a natural choice of invariant maps except in special cases. We study different ways of incorporating diagonal invariance in neural network ans\"atze trained via variational Monte Carlo methods, and consider specifically data augmentation, group averaging and canonicalization. We show that, contrary to standard ML setups, in-training symmetrization destabilizes training and can lead to worse performance. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that this unexpected behavior may arise from a unique computational-statistical tradeoff not found in standard ML analyses of symmetrization. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that post hoc averaging is less sensitive to such tradeoffs and emerges as a simple, flexible and effective method for improving neural network solvers.</description>

      <title>Magnetic transition in marcasite FeTe$_{2}$ induced by the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05422v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic ground states in crystalline systems are significant for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite FeTe$_{2}$, characterized as a small-gap semiconductor, exhibits anomalous magnetic behaviors in low-temperature experiments. In this study, first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy are employed to investigate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$. It is revealed that the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion plays the key role in the formation of localized magnetic moments in FeTe$_{2}$. The ground state of FeTe$_{2}$ bulk is confirmed to be nonmagnetic, while the previously observed magnetic responses of FeTe$_{2}$ are suggested to be related to the magnetic Fe atoms on the crystal surfaces. Our work proposes a straightforward theoretical criterion for determining ground-state magnetism of various localized-moment systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals heterostructures provide a platform for studying a wide range of electron correlation phenomena, including unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, fabricating such devices is challenging due to the difficulty in achieving and maintaining homogeneous twist-angles. Here, we present a fabrication method to preserve the twist-angle with minimal deformation. We fabricated marginally twisted double-bilayer graphene (mTDBG) stacks and directly imaged the resulting triangular superlattice periodicity via scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). This technique enabled us to monitor twist-angle deformation at each fabrication step, paving the way for more reliable device fabrication and facilitating the exploration of twist-angle-dependent physics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Carrier Dynamics in Polycarbonate Following Excitation with Ultrashort Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers (UPL) experience a range of physical and chemical changes that play a key role in applications ranging from material processing to advanced photonics, and biomedicine. To elucidate the interaction of UPL with polymeric materials, ultrafast phenomena such as carrier dynamics, recombination and relaxation are investigated assuming polycarbonate (PC) as a test material exposed to laser pulses of moderate energies. A theoretical model developed for dielectric materials is extended to describe the, previously, unexplored excitation and carrier dynamics for PC while femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy is used to elucidate the evolution of the materials response and ultrafast dynamics. Interpreting the experimental measurements using the theoretical model suggests the existence of an energy level that facilitates the formation of self-trapped exciton metastates between the conduction and valence bands (approximately 2.4-2.8 eV below the conduction band). It also predicts the electron-plasma lifetime (around 110-150 fs), the recombination time (about 34 ps), and the non-linear part of the refractive index due to Kerr effect (with n_2 values ranging from (1.1-1.5)x10^{-16} cm2/W). Furthermore, the dominant character of multi-photon assisted ionisation is emphasised while the optical breakdown threshold is also calculated and found to be equal to 2.55 x10^12 W/cm2. The results are expected to support future efforts aimed at elucidating how intense ultrashort laser pulses interact with polymeric materials which is crucial for optimizing the manufacturing processes of these materials for potential applications.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may fall short of capturing complex behaviors with the same precision. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.</description>

      <title>Known Unknowns: Out-of-Distribution Property Prediction in Materials and Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovery of high-performance materials and molecules requires identifying extremes with property values that fall outside the known distribution. Therefore, the ability to extrapolate to out-of-distribution (OOD) property values is critical for both solid-state materials and molecular design. Our objective is to train predictor models that extrapolate zero-shot to higher ranges than in the training data, given the chemical compositions of solids or molecular graphs and their property values. We propose using a transductive approach to OOD property prediction, achieving improvements in prediction accuracy. In particular, the True Positive Rate (TPR) of OOD classification of materials and molecules improved by 3x and 2.5x, respectively, and precision improved by 2x and 1.5x compared to non-transductive baselines. Our method leverages analogical input-target relations in the training and test sets, enabling generalization beyond the training target support, and can be applied to any other material and molecular tasks.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the normal and superconducting state properties of ternary scandium tellurides, Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M = $ Fe, Ru and Ir) through chemical substitution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of a unifying theory for non-BCS superconductivity has faced significant challenges. One approach to overcome such challenges is to perform systematic investigations into superconductors containing \textit{d}-electron metals in order to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Recently, the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = d-electron metal) family has emerged as a unique series of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across a range of $3d$, $4d$, and $5d$ electron systems. In this study, we employ muon spin rotation, neutron diffraction, and magnetisation techniques to probe the normal and superconducting states at a microscopic level. Our findings reveal extremely dilute superfluid densities that correlate with the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). Additionally, we identify high-temperature normal-state transitions that are inversely correlated with $T_\mathrm{c}$. Notably, in Sc$_6$FeTe$_2$, the superconducting pairing symmetry is most likely characterised by two nodeless gaps, one of which closes as electron correlations diminish in the Ru and Ir Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds. These results classify the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds ($M$ = Fe, Ru, Ir) as unconventional bulk superconductors, where the normal-state transitions and superconducting properties are governed by the interplay between electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling of the d-electron metal.</description>

      <title>Identification of metastable lattice distortion free charge density wave at photoinduced interface via TRARPES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between different degrees of freedom governs the emergence of correlated electronic states in quantum materials, with charge density waves (CDW) often coexisting with other exotic phases. Under thermal equilibrium, traditional CDW states are consequentially accompanied by structural phase transitions. In contrast, ultrafast photoexcitation allows access to exotic states where a single degree of freedom dominates in the time domain, enabling the study of underlying physics without interference. Here, we report the realization of a long-lived metastable CDW state without lattice distortion at the photoinduced interfaces in GdTe3 using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. After optical excitation above the CDW melting threshold, we identified emerged metastable interfaces through inverting the CDW-coupled lattice distortions, with lifetimes on the order of 10 picoseconds. These photoinduced interfaces represent a novel CDW state lacking the usual amplitude mode and lattice distortions, allowing quantification of the dominant role of electronic instabilities in CDW order. This work provides a new approach to disentangling electronic instabilities from electron-phonon coupling using a nonequilibrium method.</description>

      <title>Modeling of High-Sensitivity SAW Magnetic Field Sensors with Au-SiO2 Phononic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of magnetic field sensors with high sensitivity is crucial for accurate detection of magnetic fields. In this context, we present a theoretical model of a highly sensitive surface acoustic wave (SAW) magnetic field sensor that utilizes phononic crystal (PnC) structures composed of Au pillars embedded within a SiO2 guiding layer. We study rectangular and triangular PnCs and assess their potential for application in thin-film magnetic field sensors. In our design, the PnC is integrated into the SiO2 guiding layer, preserving the continuous magnetostrictive layer and maximizing its interaction with the SAW. The sensor achieves nearly two orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to a continuous delay line of similar dimensions and an eight-fold improvement over the previous sensor design with PnCs composed of FeCoSiB pillars. The enhanced sensitivity is attributed to resonance effects within the PnC leading to an increased interaction between the SAW and the continuous FeCoSiB layer covering the PnC. Our results highlight the significant potential of incorporating PnCs into the guiding layer of SAWs for future high performance magnetic field sensors.</description>

      <title>Brightening dark excitons and trions in systems with a Mexican-hat energy dispersion: example of InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of momentum-dark excitons and trions formed in two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit an inverted Mexican-hat-shaped dispersion relation, taking monolayer InSe as an example. We employ variational techniques to obtain the momentum-dark and bright ground-states (non-zero and zero quasiparticle momenta, respectively). These states are of particular interest due to their peaks in the quasiparticle density of states, the largest contribution comes from the momentum-dark ground state due to the presence of a van Hove singularity (VHS). These momentum-dark systems require a physical process to provide the necessary momentum to become bright. We study the brightening of this state due to coupling with phonons and compute the resulting photoluminescence spectrum. This work opens new avenues of research, such as exploiting dark excitons in solar cells and other semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Complex Brillouin Zone for Localised Modes in Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical and numerical framework for studying evanescent waves in subwavelength band gap materials. By establishing a link between the complex Brillouin zone and various Hermitian and non-Hermitian phenomena, including defect localisation in band gap materials and the non-Hermitian skin effect, we provide a unified perspective on these systems. In two-dimensional structures, we develop analytical techniques and numerical methods to study singularities of the complex band structure. This way, we demonstrate that gap functions effectively predict the decay rates of defect states. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the Floquet transform with respect to complex quasimomenta. Based on this, we show that evanescent waves may undergo a phase transition, where local oscillations drastically depend on the location of corresponding frequency inside the band gap.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the intrinsic SOC incorporated in a tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi=$constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Predictions of MB5N5: Atom-Stuffed Boronitride Clathrate Cages Derived from the High-Pressure Superhydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates 180 MX5Y5 (X, Y = B, C, or N) clathrate-like structures derived from MH10 superhydrides using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimizations and phonon calculations. A wide variety of electropositive and electronegative encapsulated atoms were considered. From all of the studied systems only 31 MB5N5 phases were found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure. The highest 1-atmosphere superconducting critical transition temperature was predicted for FB5N5. However, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all of the identified superconducting phases decompose by 300~K at 1~atm, while only nine semiconducting phases remained thermally stable. Our findings underscore the critical role of kinetic and thermal stability in predicting viable superconductors. The electronic structure of the MB5N5 compounds were rationalized in terms of electron donating and withdrawing intercalants, and machine-learning based predictions of their mechanical properties were compared with those of an empty boronitride cage.</description>

      <title>The influence of Structural Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites on their Photoluminescence Efficiency -- Neutron scattering analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising materials for light-emitting diode applications. In this study, by using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy we identified and quantitatively separated the lattice vibrational and molecular rotational dynamics of two perovskites, butylammonium lead iodide (BA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$ and phenethyl-ammonium lead iodide (PEA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$. By examining the corresponding temperature dependence, we found that the lattice vibrations, as evidenced by neutron spectra, are consistent with the lattice dynamics obtained from Raman scattering. We revealed that the rotational dynamics of organic molecules in these materials tend to suppress their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) while the vibrational dynamics did not show predominant correlations with the same. Additionally, we observed photoluminescence emission peak splitting for both systems, which becomes prominent above certain critical temperatures where the suppression of PLQY begins. This study suggests that the rotational motions of polarized molecules may lead to a reduction in exciton binding energy or the breaking of degeneracy in exciton binding energy levels, enhancing non-radiative recombination rates, and consequently reducing photoluminescence yield. These findings offer a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions in 2D HOIPs and could guide the design of more efficient light-emitting materials for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Regulation of electronic structures in ReSeS monolayer with anisotropic deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of their unique and rich physical properties, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) materials have attracted much interest. Many studies suggest that introducing the degree of freedom of anisotropy, which may be brought about by low structural symmetry, might further optimize their applications in industry and manufacturing. However, most currently reported TMDs do not achieve the theoretical minimum symmetry. Utilizing the first principles calculation, we present ReSeS monolayer with a Janus structure. Results indicate that its electronic dispersion is sensitive to structural distortions, which increases metallicity. Our reduction-Hamiltonian can provide a qualitative description, but further analyses reveal that bonding/antibonding properties near the Fermi surface are the more fundamental cause of the variations. Furthermore, geometric deformations can regulate the effective mass of electrons as well as the spectroscopic response, resulting in anisotropic behaviors. Our ideas serve as a foundation for developing new regulable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Self-induced spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect in single FePt thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin-charge current conversion characteristics of chemically disordered ferromagnetic single FePt thin films by spin-pumping ferromagnetic resonance experiments performed on both a resonance cavity and on patterned devices. We clearly observe a self-induced signal in a single FePt layer. The sign of a single FePt spin pumping voltage signal is consistent with a typical bilayer with a positive spin Hall angle layer such as that of Pt on top of a ferromagnet (FM), substrate//FM/Pt. Structural analysis shows a strong composition gradient due to natural oxidation at both FePt interfaces, with the Si substrate and with the air. The FePt-thickness dependence of the self-induced charge current produced allowed us to obtain $\lambda _ \text{FePt}=(1.5\pm 0.1)$ nm and self-induced $\theta_ \text{self-FePt}=0.047 \pm 0.003$, with efficiency for reciprocal effects applications $\theta _ \text{self-FePt} \times \lambda _ \text{FePt} = 0.071$ nm which is comparable to that of Pt, $\theta _ \text{SH-Pt} \times \lambda _ \text{Pt} = 0.2$ nm. Moreover, by studying bilayer systems such as Si//FePt/Pt and Si//Pt//FePt we independently could extract the individual contributions of the external inverse spin Hall effect of Pt and the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect of FePt. Notably, this method gives consistent values of charge currents produced due to only self-induced inverse spin Hall effect in FePt layers. These results advance our understanding of spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms in composite thin films and pave the way for the development of next-generation spintronics devices based on self-torque.</description>

      <title>Microstructural characterization to reveal evidence of shock deformation in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of meteorites and their microstructures is a topic which spans multiple fields of research, such as meteoritics and materials science. For materials scientists and engineers, the extreme and unusual conditions which these microstructures form allow for insight into materials which would exist at the edge of our thermomechanical processing abilities. One such microstructure found in low-shock event iron meteorites is Neumann bands. These bands are an array of lenticular deformation twins that form throughout the Fe-Ni matrix with numerous intersections, resulting in many high stress and strain regions within the material's surface. The existence of these regions and the shocks that formed them encourage atypical strain accommodating mechanisms and structural changes of the material. However, direct investigation of the deformation twin intersections and the microstructural behaviour in and around these regions has been limited. In this work, investigation of these regions in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment, with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and forescatter electron (FSE) imaging, revealed two primary findings: high-intensity pattern doubling mirrored across the {110} band at twin-twin intersection and microband formation across the sample surface, which suggest multilayer twinning and constraint of the crystal structure at points of twin-twin intersection. Microbands were found to form along the {110} plane and in regions near Neumann bands. The simultaneous existence of Neumann bands (microtwins) and microbands is presented here for a BCC material, and it is believed the Neumann band and microbands formed during different types and/or shock events. The presence of both Neumann bands and microbands within a BCC iron meteorite is previously unreported and may be valuable in furthering our understanding of shock deformation within iron-based materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic threshold electric field for domain wall motion in ferroelectrics based on discretized phase-field model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of ferroelectric memories, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the ferroelectric switching behaviors at small applied electric fields. In this \rv{paper}, we use discretized phase-field models to systematically investigate the intrinsic threshold electric field (TEF) to drive flat 180$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$ domain walls (DWs), which can not be captured by continuum models. The results show that this TEF increases as the ratio of DW width to unit cell size decreases, and it becomes significant if the DW width is thinner than two unit cells. The results are qualitatively consistent with existing first-principles studies and cryogenic experiments. In addition, this work proposes a conceptual model to explain the activation electric field (AEF) observed in experiments at room temperature. This work improves the understanding of DW motion kinetics at small applied fields, and shows that the mesh size and orientation are both important for the phase-field modeling of the above process.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear field dependence of Hall effect and high-mobility multi-carrier transport in an altermagnet CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising candidate for altermagnet, CrSb possesses a distinctive compensated spin split band structure that could bring groundbreaking concepts to the field of spintronics. In this work, we have grown high-quality CrSb single crystals and comprehensively investigated their electronic and magneto-transport properties. We have observed large, positive, and non-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which well obeys Kohler's rule, indicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. Remarkably, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous Hall is identified over a wide temperature range. After careful analysis of the transport data, we conclude the non-linearity mainly stems from the incorporation of different carriers in the magnetoconductivity. According to the Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit the conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier concentration and mobility indicates that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal, with the highest mobility reaching 3*103 cm2V-1s-1. Furthermore, calculations using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have successfully reproduced the main features of the experimental MR and Hall effect in CrSb. These exceptional transport properties make CrSb unique for applications in spintronics as an altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

Abstract: Exploring how mechanical strain can modify the magnetic properties of low-dimensional structures is one of the priorities of straintronics, an area in condensed matter physics. It has been proven by calculating the parameters of magnetic interactions Jij and developing structural/magnetic models of the layered dichalcogenides MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2 and layered double hydroxides (M2+)6Al3(OH)18[Na(H2O)6](SO4)2 6H2O (M2+ = Mn2+, Fe2+) with a grapheme type structure that magnetic interactions are responsive to the mechanical deformation of their crystal structure. As turned out, the ions in these antiferromagnetic materials are situated in the hexagonal planes close to critical positions. We have thus demonstrated that the fluctuations of the intermediate ions near critical positions due to mechanical strain cause dramatic changes to the magnetic parameters and allow the magnetic properties to be modified by mechanical strain. To be sure, an abundant class of new 2D materials transition-metal-based double hydroxides, whose properties are similar to those of molybdenum-based chalcogenides have promise as materials to be used in straintronics.</description>

      <title>Deformation assisted precipitation in binary alloys: A competition of time-scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the process of precipitation in binary alloys in the presence of mechanical deformation. It is commonly observed that mechanical deformation prior to or during precipitation leads to microstructure with excess defects, which allows for enhanced precipitate nucleation and growth rates \cite{Weiss1979,Okaguchi1992,Deschamps2003}. To investigate this phenomenon, we employ a two-dimensional phase-field crystal alloy model endowed with a temperature dependent mobility, making it capable of recovering isothermal transformation (TTT) diagrams with a characteristic inflection point (nose) about a critical temperature. We examine the variation in the time-scale of precipitation and its connection to the time-scale of the applied deformation, focusing on the roles of atomic defects in the processes involved. Our results indicate that precipitation is initially delayed through application of a deformation until a critical strain is achieved, beyond which precipitation proceeds more rapidly, assisted by plastic deformation such as grain boundary serration or dislocation nucleation. We show that the evolution of the precipitated fraction, $f(t)$, departs from classical Avrami behaviour. Specifically, $df/dt$ develops two peaks indicative of a ``plateau"-like inflection in $f(t)$, signalling the transition to defect assisted precipitate nucleation. We analyze these plateaus as a function of the deformation rate and demonstrate that the they exhibit a discontinuous bifurcation as the time-scale of applied deformation is increased. These findings are compared to and found to be consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Corrugation-dominated mechanical softening of defect-engineered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (&lt; 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</description>

      <title>On the importance of Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion in the formation of a Ni-Au / p-GaN ohmic contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control of functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently, electronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as monolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence signal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly tuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal that this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit properties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our work establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.</description>

      <title>Native antisite defects in h-BN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Filling-dependent intertwined electronic and atomic orders in the flat-band state of 1T-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental prerequisite of these exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity, nematic order, and checkerboard charge order. Here we explore the filling-dependent multiple stable intertwined electronic and atomic orders of flat-band state of 1T-TaS2 encompassing hole order, phase orders, coexisting left- and right-chiral orders and mixed phase/chiral orders via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Combining first-principles calculations, the emergent electronic/atomic orders can be attributed to the weakening of electron-electron correlations and stacking-dependent interlayer interactions. Moreover, achiral intermediate ring-like clusters and nematic charge density wave (CDW) states are successfully realized in intralayer chiral domain wall and interlayer heterochiral stacking regions through chiral overlap configurations. Our study not only deepens the understanding of filling-dependent electronic/atomic orders in flat-band systems, but also offers perspectives for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Wannier center spectroscopy to identify boundary-obstructed topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hallmark of topological crystalline insulators is the emergence of a robust electronic state in a bandgap localized at the boundary of the material. However, end, edge, and surface states can also have a non-topological origin. Unfortunately, topological invariants such as the winding number and Zak-phase are often not directly experimentally accessible for solids. In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provides a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.</description>

      <title>Detecting winding and Chern numbers in topological matter using spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to directly probe bulk topological quantum numbers in topological matter by measuring the momentum-space single-particle spectral function (SPSF). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can detect SPSF and is often used to determine the bulk band structure of quantum materials. Here, we show that while one part of the momentum-space SPSF gives band structure, it also contains the knowledge of winding and Chern numbers of various topological materials. For this, we derive SPSF in different models of topological systems, such as the Kitaev model of topological superconductors, the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, the Haldane model on a hexagonal lattice and a four-band model that is a physical realization of the Kitaev chain and explain how to extract the winding or Chern numbers in different topological phases from the SPSF. Such information from SPSF seems experimentally accessible due to the recent advancement of ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques. While the detection of bulk topological quantum numbers using the SPSF works well for one-dimensional systems, it has certain limitations for higher-dimensional systems, where it must be complementary with another measurement to ensure the matter under investigation is topological, i.e., having a non-zero Chern number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport calculations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has long limited their practical applications. We present a general framework that combines the deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian (DeePTB) approach with the non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method, enabling efficient quantum transport calculations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic anomalies in quantum magnon transport caused by tunable junction geometries in cold atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanical softening and enhanced elasticity of lunar olivine probed via nanoindentation and high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. Also, we have performed synchrotron-based high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the compressibility properties of this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, of three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine relative to terrestrial olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite. The origin of the observed differences is discussed. A simple model combining the results of both our nanoindentation and HP-XRD measurements allows us to describe the contribution of macroscopic and chemical-bond related effects, both of which are necessary to reproduce the observed elastic modulus softening. Such joint analysis of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue for characterizing these highly interesting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swift discovery of spin-crossover materials for their potential application in quantum information devices requires techniques which enable efficient identification of suitably bistable candidates. To this end, we screened the Cambridge Structural Database to develop a specialized database of 1,439 materials and computed spin-switching energies from density functional theory for each material. The database was used to train an equivariant graph convolutional neural network to predict the magnitude of the spin-conversion energy. A test mean absolute error was 360 meV. For candidate identification, we equipped the system with a relevance-based classifier. This approach leads to a nearly four-fold improvement in identifying potential spin-crossover systems of interest as compared to conventional high-throughput screening.</description>
