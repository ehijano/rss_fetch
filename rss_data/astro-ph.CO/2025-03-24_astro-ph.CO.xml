      <title>Catalog-based detection of unrecognized blends in deep optical ground based catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deep, ground-based imaging, about 15%-30% of object detections are expected to correspond to two or more true objects - these are called ``unrecognized blends''. We use Machine Learning algorithms to detect unrecognized blends in deep ground-based photometry using only catalog-level information: colors, magnitude, and size. We compare the performance of Self Organizing Map, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Anomaly Detection algorithms. We test all algorithms on 9-band ($uBVri^{+}z^{++}YJH$) and 1-size (flux_radius in $\textit{i}$-band) measurements of the ground-based COSMOS catalog, and use COSMOS HST data as the truth for unrecognized blend. We find that 17% of objects in the ground-based COSMOS catalog are unrecognized blends. We show that some unrecognized blends can be identified as such using only catalog-level information; but not all blends can be easily identified. Nonetheless, our methods can be used to improve sample purity, and can identify approximately 30% to 80% of unrecognized blends while rejecting 10% to 50% of all detected galaxies (blended or unblended). The results are similar when only optical bands ($uBVri^{+}z^{++}$) and the size information is available. We also investigate the ability of these algorithms to remove photo-z outliers (identified with spectroscopic redshifts), and find that algorithms targeting color outliers perform better than algorithms targeting unrecognized blends. Our method can offer a cleaner galaxy sample with lower blending rates for future cosmological surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and can potentially improve the accuracy on cosmological parameter constraints at a moderate cost of precision.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of ultralight complex scalar field dark matter and its impact on the growth of structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass window of ultralight axion dark matter motivated by suppressing the growth of structure on subgalactic scales, $m\sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, is now severely constrained by various observation data (e.g. Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). As an attempt to reopen this mass window, we investigate an alternative ultralight dark matter candidate, the complex scalar field dark matter (SFDM). We derive the relativistic hydrodynamics of the complex SFDM in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Our formalism contains two novel ingredients uniquely associated with the complex SFDM model: the Eckart frame defined by the conserved Noether current, and the stiff gauge condition, $c_s^2\equiv (\delta P/\delta\rho)|_s=1$. In the Eckart frame, the complex SFDM is effectively an imperfect fluid with a dissipative energy flux, distinguishing itself from axion dark matter. The energy flux can affect the growth of density fluctuations dynamically. Meanwhile, we apply the stiff gauge condition to find new constitutive equations for the complex SFDM. We revisit the homogeneous evolution of the complex SFDM and present illustrative early-stage solutions for perturbations of the complex SFDM in a simplified setting. We demonstrate the effects of varying the model parameters on the evolution of the perturbation variables.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Preheating in Higgs--$R^2$ Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the preheating dynamics and associated gravitational wave signatures in the Higgs--$R^2$ inflationary model. Using lattice simulations, we investigate the post-inflationary evolution of the system across the parameter space, covering both the Higgs-like and $R^2$-like scenarios. We demonstrate that the efficiency of preheating is significantly dependent on the nonminimal coupling parameter $\xi$. As the $\xi$ parameter increases, moving from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime, we observe more efficient preheating. Through detailed numerical computations, efficient preheating is shown to lead to stronger gravitational wave production. The amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum varies by several orders of magnitude as we move from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime. The resultant gravitational wave signatures can serve as a potential observational probe to distinguish between different parameter regimes of the Higgs--$R^2$ model.</description>

      <title>Maximising information from weak lensing galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing galaxy surveys are currently undergoing a dramatic revolution as the dawn of the Stage-IV surveys are upon us. Hence, ensuring that our analysis methods are as accurate and precise as the raw data is of upmost importance. This motivated the development of a new implementation of the quadratic maximum likelihood power spectrum estimation technique, the application of the theoretical uncertainties approach to mitigate baryonic feedback biases, and to re-evaluating the criterion from which binary scale cuts are derived when aiming to eliminate baryonic biases. These techniques maximise the available information from weak lensing observations while minimising potential systematic biases, and shows how this PhD thesis contributes to the advancement of weak lensing cosmology.</description>

      <title>Observer motion and boosting effects on the cosmic background monopole spectrum, solutions and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiar motion of an observer relative to an ideal reference frame at rest with respect to the cosmic background produces boosting effects which modify and transfer at higher multipoles the frequency spectrum of the isotropic background. To mitigate the computational effort needed for accurate theoretical predictions, analytical solutions of a linear system able to evaluate the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients for (analytical or semi-analytical) background representations have been presented, and extended to generic tabulated functions potentially affected by numerical uncertainties. Owing to the dipole spectrum frequency dependence and to precise inter-frequency calibrations, it will be possible to constrain (or even detect) the tiny imprints in the background spectrum from a variety of cosmological and astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>The SPT-Deep Cluster Catalog: Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Selected Clusters from Combined SPT-3G and SPTpol Measurements over 100 Square Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 500 galaxy cluster candidates in the SPT-Deep field: a 100 deg$^2$ field that combines data from the SPT-3G and SPTpol surveys to reach noise levels of 3.0, 2.2, and 9.0 $\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. This is comparable to noise levels expected for the wide field survey of CMB-S4, a next-generation CMB experiment. Candidates are selected via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with a minimum significance of $\xi = 4.0$, resulting in a catalog of purity $\sim 89 \%$. Optical data from the Dark Energy Survey and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope are used to confirm 442 cluster candidates. The clusters span $0.12 &lt; z \lesssim 1.8$ and $1.0 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70} &lt; M_{500c} &lt; 8.7 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$. The sample's median redshift is 0.74 and the median mass is $1.7 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$; these are the lowest median mass and highest median redshift of any SZ-selected sample to date. We assess the effect of infrared emission from cluster member galaxies on cluster selection by performing a joint fit to the infrared dust and tSZ signals by combining measurements from SPT and overlapping submillimeter data from Herschel/SPIRE. We find that at high redshift ($z&gt;1)$, the tSZ signal is reduced by $17.4^{+3.1}_{-2.9} \%$ ($3.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}\%$) at 150 GHz (95 GHz) due to dust contamination. We repeat our cluster finding method on dust-nulled SPT maps and find the resulting catalog is consistent with the nominal SPT-Deep catalog, demonstrating dust contamination does not significantly impact the SPT-Deep selection function; we attribute this lack of bias to the inclusion of the SPT 220 GHz band.</description>

      <title>Structure evolution with cosmic backgrounds from radio to far infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic background radiation, both diffuse and discrete in nature, produced at different cosmic epochs before and after recombination, provides key information on the evolution of cosmic structures. We discuss the main classes of sources that contribute to the extragalactic background light from radio to sub-millimetre wavelenghs and the currently open question on the level of the cosmic radio background spectrum. The redshifted 21cm line signal from cosmological neutral Hydrogen during the primeval phases of cosmic structures as a probe of the cosmological reionisation process is presented, along with the route for confident detection of this signal. We then describe the basic formalism and the feasibility to study via a differential approach, based mainly on dipole analysis, the tiny imprints in the CB spectrum expected from a variety of cosmological and astrophysical processes at work during the early phases of cosmic perturbation and structure evolution. Finally, we discuss the identification of high-redshift sub-millimetre lensed galaxies with extreme magnifications in the Planck maps and their use for the comprehension of fundamental processes in early galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Comparison of dynamical dark energy with {\Lambda}CDM in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state, $w(a)$, using the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data in combination with Pantheon+ and DES5Y Type Ia supernovae measurements, respectively. Building on our previous analysis in arXiv:2503.08658, which employed a nonparametric flexknot reconstruction approach, we examine whether the evidence for dynamical dark energy persists with the improved precision of the DESI DR2 dataset. We find that while the overall qualitative structure of $w(a)$ remains consistent with our earlier findings, the statistical support for dynamical dark energy is reduced when considering DESI DR2 data alone, particularly for more complex flexknot models with higher numbers of knots. However, the evidence for simpler dynamical models, such as $w$CDM and CPL (which correspond to $n=1$ and $n=2$ knots respectively), increases relative to $\Lambda$CDM with DESI DR2 alone, consistent with previous DESI analyses. When combined with Pantheon+ data, the conclusions remain broadly consistent with our earlier work, but the inclusion of DES5Y supernovae data leads to an increase of preference for flexknot models with more than two knots, placing $w$CDM and CPL on par with $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>A "Black Hole Star" Reveals the Remarkable Gas-Enshrouded Hearts of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical processes that led to the formation of billion solar mass black holes within the first 700 million years of cosmic time remain a puzzle. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a "black hole star" (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free "atmosphere" around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super-Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos: dynamics and distinguishability of halo models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a key target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be affected in the presence of dark matter (DM) halos. In this paper we explore whether the effects of DM are detectable by LISA within a fully relativistic framework. We model the massive EMRI component as a nonrotating black hole (BH) surrounded by a DM halo. We compute axial and polar GW fluxes for circular orbits at linear order in the mass ratio for DM density profiles with varying mass and compactness. By comparing the phase evolution with vacuum systems, we find that DM halos can induce dephasings of tens to hundreds of radians over a one-year observation period. We demonstrate that even highly diluted DM distributions can significantly affect the emitted waveforms, and that the resulting GW signals can usually be distinguished from each other. While it is important to generalize these findings to more generic orbits and to spinning BHs, our results suggest that LISA could not only reveal the presence of DM halos, but also discriminate between different halo models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.</description>

However, HPC users are generally less aware of how these energy concerns influence the design, deployment, and operation of supercomputers even though they experience the consequences. This paper examines the implications of HPC's energy consumption, providing an overview of current trends aimed at improving energy efficiency. We describe how hardware innovations such as energy-efficient processors, novel system architectures, power management techniques, and advanced scheduling policies do have a direct impact on how applications need to be programmed and executed on HPC systems. For application developers, understanding how these new systems work and how to analyse and report the performances of their own software is critical in the dialog with HPC system designers and administrators. The paper aims to raise awareness about energy efficiency among users, particularly in the high energy physics and astrophysics domains, offering practical advice on how to analyse and optimise applications to reduce their energy consumption without compromising on performance.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <title>Straightening the Ruler: Field-Level Inference of the BAO Scale with LEFTfield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current inferences of the BAO scale from galaxy clustering employ a reconstruction technique at fixed cosmology and bias parameters. Here, we present the first consistent joint Bayesian inference of the isotropic BAO scale, jointly varying the initial conditions as well as all bias coefficients, based on the EFT-based field-level forward model $\texttt{LEFTfield}$. We apply this analysis to mock data generated at a much higher cutoff, or resolution, resulting in a significant model mismatch between mock data and the model used in the inference. We demonstrate that the remaining systematic bias in the BAO scale is below 2% for all data considered and below 1% when Eulerian bias is used for inference. Furthermore, we find that the inferred error on the BAO scale is typically 30%, and up to 50%, smaller compared to that from a replication of the standard post-reconstruction power-spectrum approach, using the same scales as in the field-level inference. The improvement in BAO scale precision grows towards smaller scales (higher $k$). As a validation test, we repeat this comparison on a mock dataset that is linearly biased with respect to a 1LPT (Zel'dovich) density field, following the assumption made in standard reconstruction approaches. We find that field-level inference indeed yields the same error bar as the post-reconstruction power spectrum, which is expectd to be optimal in this case. In summary, a field-level approach to BAO not only allows for a consistent inference of the BAO scale, but promises to achieve more precise measurements on realistic, nonlinearly biased tracers as well.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with voids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voids are dominant features of the cosmic web. We revisit the cosmological information content of voids and connect void properties with the parameters of the background universe. We combine analytical results with a suite of large n-body realizations of large-scale structure in the quasilinear regime to measure the central density and radial outflow of voids. These properties, estimated from multiple voids that span a range of redshifts, provide estimates of the Hubble parameter, $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$. The analysis assumes access to the full phase-space distribution of mass within voids, a dataset that is not currently observable. The observable properties of the largest void in the universe may also test models. The suite of large n-body realizations enables construction of lightcones reaching ~3,000 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Based on these lightcones, we show that large voids similar to those observed are expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dynamical Nature and Radio Halo Emission of Abell 384: A Combined Radio, X-ray and Optical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiwavelength studies of galaxy clusters are crucial for understanding the complex interconnection of the thermal and non-thermal constituents of these massive structures and uncovering the physical processes involved in their formation and evolution. Here, we report a multiwavelength assessment of the galaxy cluster A384, which was previously reported to host a radio halo with a 660 kpc size at MeerKAT 1.28 GHz. The halo is slightly offset from the cluster centre. Our uGMRT observation reveals that the halo extends up to 690 kpc at 407 MHz with a nonuniform spectral index $\alpha^{1284\ \mathrm{MHz}}_{407\ \mathrm{MHz}}$ distribution varying from flat (-0.5) to steep (-1.3) values. In addition, we use legacy GMRT 608 MHz, \textit{XMM-Newton} X-ray, and the Dark Energy Survey optical observations to obtain an extensive understanding of the dynamical nature of the galaxy cluster. The X-ray surface brightness concentration parameter ($C_{\rm{SB}} = 0.16$) and centroid shift ($w = 0.057$) reveal an ongoing dynamical disturbance in the cluster. This is also supported by the elongated 2-D optical galaxy density distribution map of the cluster. The obtained centre shift between optical and X-ray peaks and the asymmetry parameter from optical analysis further supports the dynamical disturbance in the cluster. The radio and X-ray surface brightness follows a sub-linear correlation. Our observations suggest that the cluster is currently in a merging state where particle re-acceleration in the turbulent ICM resulted in the radio halo emission.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmological expansion on spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium and once more about Olbers' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the expansion of the Universe on the formation of the total spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium. Assuming the same proper thermal spectrum of sources, we show how the expansion of the Universe changes the nature of the energy distribution of the thermal spectrum: a decrease of the energy density in the Wien range and an increase in the Rayleigh--Jeans range with increasing the redshift of the bulk filled by sources. This is due to the cosmological redshift and the growing contribution of large number of distant sources. The numerical estimations also illustrate the main factors that resolve the Olbers' paradox in the expanding Universe: i) the particle horizon, ii) the finiteness of the volume filled by luminous objects, and iii) the cosmological redshift. Applying the obtained expressions to the epoch of reionization made it possible to estimate the concentration of objects of various classes (stars, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies) necessary for complete reionization of hydrogen at $z=6$. It is shown that even a small part of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies with a thermal spectrum of moderate temperature, from those predicted by Press-Schechter formalism and its improvements, is able to completely reionize hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at $z=6$.</description>

      <title>The impact of baryons on the sparsity of simulated galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the sparsity of galaxy clusters can be used to probe the cosmological information encoded in the host dark matter halo profile, and infer constraints on the cosmological model parameters. Key to the success of these analyses is the control of potential sources of systematic uncertainty. As an example, the presence of baryons can alter the cluster sparsity with respect to predictions from N-body simulations. Similarly, a radial dependent mass bias, as in the case of masses inferred under the hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) hypothesis, can affect sparsity estimates. We examine the imprint of baryonic processes on the sparsity statistics. Then, we investigate the relation between cluster sparsities and gas mass fraction. Finally, we perform a study of the impact of HE mass bias on sparsity measurements and the implication on cosmological parameter inference analyses. We use catalogues of simulated galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project and run a comparative analysis of the sparsity of clusters from N-body/hydro simulations implementing different feedback model scenarios. Sparsities which probe the mass profile across a large radial range are affected by the presence of baryons in a way that is particularly sensitive to astrophysical feedback, whereas those probing exclusively external cluster regions are less affected. In the former case, we find the sparsities to be moderately correlated with measurements of the gas fraction in the inner cluster regions. We infer constraints on $S_8$ using synthetic average sparsity measurements generated to evaluate the impact of baryons, selection effects and HE bias. In the case of multiple sparsities these lead to highly bias results. Hence, we calibrate linear bias models that enable us to correct for these effects and recover unbiased constraints that are significantly tighter than those inferred from single sparsity analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly supercooled first order phase transitions (FOPTs) can produce primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM) along with observable gravitational waves (GWs) from bubble collisions. Such FOPTs may also produce coherent magnetic fields generated by bubble collisions and by turbulence in the primordial plasma. Here we find that the requirement for PBH DM can produce large primordial magnetic fields which subsequently yield intergalactic magnetic fields in the present universe (with magnitude $\lesssim 20$ pG across coherence length scales of $\simeq 0.001$-$0.01$ Mpc, assuming maximally helical magnetic fields) that easily exceed lower bounds from blazar observations. We follow a largely model independent approach and highlight the possibility of producing DM and observable multi-messenger magnetic fields and GW signals visible in next generation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-tensor effective field theories of gravity. The scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, being corrections of the lowest orders, can give rise to hairy black holes. By requiring infrared causality, we impose lower bounds on the cutoff scales of the theories. With these bounds, we further discuss the detectability of sGB gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Compared with the gravitational effective field theories that contain only the two tensor modes, adding extra degrees of freedom, such as adding a scalar, opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>Zapped then Napped? A rapidly quenched remnant leaker candidate with a steep spectroscopic $\beta_{UV}$ slope at z=8.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam Photometry to explore the properties of JADES-GS8-RL-1, a rapidly quenched, $z=8.5$ galaxy with a stellar mass of $10^{8.9}M_\odot$, a steep blue UV slope, a Balmer break, and no sign of strong emission lines. With a $\beta_{UV}$=-2.8$\pm 0.2$, as measured from the NIRSpec spectrum, JADES-GS8-RL-1 is consistent with negligible dust attenuation and little to no contribution from the nebular continuum alongside a probable high escape fraction. The $\beta_{UV}$ slope measured from photometry varies from -3.0 in the central regions to -2.2 at the outskirts suggesting possible regional differences in the escape fraction. There are no high-ionisation emission lines, only a tentative 2.9\sig detection of [OII]. Using photometry, this emission appears to be extended, possibly corresponding to weakly ionised gas expelled during or after the quenching process. JADES-GS8-RL-1 is spatially resolved with a half-light radius of 240 pc and has an exponential, disc-like morphology. It appears to have formed all its stars in a short burst within the past 100 Myr with a formation time of $\approx$70 Myr and a quenching time of $\approx$30 Myr. This quenching would have occurred rapidly, making it a more distant example of the kind of low-mass "mini-quenched" galaxies previously observed at high-z. Due to the extremely blue $\beta_{UV}$ slope, our best-fit model predicts a high value for \fesc of &gt;10\%, consistent with the value derived from the $\beta_{UV}$ slope, which when combined with our extraordinarily low O32 upper limit suggests JADES-GS8-RL-1 is a fascinating example of a high-z "remnant leaker" in one of its earliest phases, deep in the epoch of reionisation.</description>

      <title>The Qz5 Survey (I): How the HI Mass Density of the Universe Evolves With Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report that the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass density of the Universe ($\rho_{HI}$) increases with cosmic time since $z \sim 5$, peaks at $z \sim 3$, and then decreases toward $z \sim 0$. This is the first result of Qz5, our spectroscopic survey of 63 quasars at $z \gtrsim 5$ with VLT/X-SHOOTER and Keck/ESI aimed at characterizing intervening HI gas absorbers at $z \sim 5$. The main feature of Qz5 is the high resolution ($R \sim 7000 - 9000$) of the spectra, which allows us to (1) accurately detect high column density HI gas absorbers in an increasingly neutral intergalactic medium at $z \sim 5$ and (2) determine the reliability of previous $\rho_{HI}$ measurements derived with lower resolution spectroscopy. We find 5 intervening Damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z &gt; 4.5$, which corresponds to the lowest DLA incidence rate ($0.034^{0.05}_{0.02}$) at $z \gtrsim 2$. We also measure the lowest $\rho_{HI}$ at $z \gtrsim 2$ from our sample of DLAs and subDLAs, corresponding to $\rho_{HI} = 0.56^{0.82}_{0.31} \times 10^8~$M$_{\odot}~$Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 5$. Taking into account our measurements at $z \sim 5$ and systematic biases in the DLA detection rate at lower spectral resolutions, we conclude that $\rho_{HI}$ doubles from $z \sim 5$ to $z \sim 3$. From these results emerges a qualitative agreement between how the cosmic densities of HI gas mass, molecular gas mass, and star-formation rate build up with cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>
