      <title>All the Little Things in Abell 2744: $&gt;$1000 Gravitationally Lensed Dwarf Galaxies at $z=0-9$ from JWST NIRCam Grism Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies hold the key to crucial frontiers of astrophysics, however, their faintness renders spectroscopy challenging. Here we present the JWST Cycle 2 survey, All the Little Things (ALT, PID 3516), which is designed to seek late-forming Pop III stars and the drivers of reionization at $z\sim6-7$. ALT has acquired the deepest NIRCam grism spectroscopy yet (7-27 hr), at JWST's most sensitive wavelengths (3-4 $\mu$m), covering the powerful lensing cluster Abell 2744. Over the same 30 arcmin$^2$, ALT's ultra-deep F070W+F090W imaging ($\sim$30 mag) enables selection of very faint sources at $z&gt;6$. We demonstrate the success of ALT's novel ``butterfly" mosaic to solve spectral confusion and contamination, and introduce the ``Allegro" method for emission line identification. By collecting spectra for every source in the field of view, ALT has measured precise ($R\sim1600$) redshifts for 1630 sources at $z=0.2-8.5$. This includes one of the largest samples of distant dwarf galaxies: [1015, 475, 50] sources less massive than the SMC, Fornax, and Sculptor with $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;$[8.5, 7.5, 6.5]. We showcase ALT's discovery space with: (i) spatially resolved spectra of lensed clumps in galaxies as faint as $M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-15$; (ii) large-scale clustering -- overdensities at $z$=[2.50, 2.58, 3.97, 4.30, 5.66, 5.77, 6.33] hosting massive galaxies with striking Balmer breaks; (iii) small-scale clustering -- a system of satellites around a Milky Way analog at $z\sim6$; (iv) spectroscopically confirmed multiple images that help constrain the lensing model underlying all science in this legacy field; (v) sensitive star-formation maps based on dust-insensitive tracers such as Pa$\alpha$; (vi) direct spectroscopic discovery of rare sources such as AGN with ionized outflows. These results provide a powerful proof of concept for how grism surveys maximize the potential of strong lensing fields.</description>

      <title>The PANORAMIC Survey: Pure Parallel Wide Area Legacy Imaging with JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the PANORAMIC survey, a pure parallel extragalactic imaging program with NIRCam observed during JWST Cycle 1. The survey obtained $\sim$530 sq arcmin of NIRCam imaging from 1-5$\mu$m, totaling $\sim$192 hours of science integration time. This represents the largest on-sky time investment of any Cycle 1 GO extragalactic NIRCam imaging program by nearly a factor of 2. The survey includes $\sim$432 sq arcmin of novel sky area not yet observed with JWST using at least $6$ NIRCam broad-band filters, increasing the existing area covered by similar Cycle 1 data by $\sim$60%. 70 square arcmin was also covered by a 7th filter (F410M). A fraction of PANORAMIC data ($\sim$200 sq arcmin) was obtained in or around extragalactic deep-fields, enhancing their legacy value. Pure parallel observing naturally creates a wedding cake survey with both wide and ultra-deep tiers, with 5$\sigma$ point source depths at F444W ranging from 27.8-29.4 (ABmag), and with minimized cosmic variance. The 6+ filter observing setup yields remarkably good photometric redshift performance, achieving similar median scatter and outlier fraction as CANDELS ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\sim0.07$; $\eta\sim0.2$), which enables a wealth of science across redshift without the need for followup or ancillary data. We overview the proposed survey, the data obtained as part of this program, and document the science-ready data products in the first data release. PANORAMIC has delivered wide-area and deep imaging with excellent photometric performance, demonstrating that pure parallel observations with JWST are a highly efficient observing mode that is key to acquiring a complete picture of galaxy evolution from rare bright galaxies to fainter, more abundant sources at all redshifts.</description>

      <title>Evolution of lithium in the disc of the Galaxy and the role of novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium plays a crucial role in probing stellar physics and stellar and primordial nucleosynthesis, as well as the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. Stars are considered to be the main source of Li, still the identity of its primary stellar producer has long been a matter of debate. In light of recent theoretical and observational results, we investigate in this study the role of two candidate sources of Li enrichment in the Milky Way, namely AGB stars and, in particular, novae. We utilize a one-zone Galactic chemical evolution model to assess the viability of AGB stars and novae as stellar sources of Li. We use recent theoretical Li yields for AGB stars, while for novae we adopt observationally inferred Li yields and recently derived Delay Time Distributions (DTDs). Subsequently, we extend our analysis using a multi-zone model with radial migration to investigate spatial variations in the evolution of Li across the Milky Way disc and compare the results with observational data for field stars and open clusters. Our analysis shows that AGB stars fail by far to reproduce the meteoritic Li abundance. In contrast, novae appear as promising candidates within the adopted framework, allowing us to quantify the contribution of each Li source at Sun's formation and today. Our multi-zone model reveals the role of the differences in the DTDs of SN Ia and novae in shaping the evolution of Li in the various galactic zones. Its results are in fair agreement with the observational data for most open clusters, but small discrepancies appear in the outer disc.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of stellar mergers: A new scenario for several FS CMa stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abreviated) FS CMa stars belong to a diverse group of stars exhibiting the B[e] phenomenon, which is manifested mainly by the presence of forbidden emission lines and a~strong infrared (IR) excess in their spectra. Recently, a strong magnetic field has been discovered in the FS CMa star IRAS 17449+2320. Its strength and an unusually high space velocity point to a post-merger nature. Stellar mergers may provide an explanation for the complex and sometimes chaotic behaviour of some of the FS CMa stars. We did a statistical study of numerical simulations using Aarseth's NBODY6 code. We show the importance of stellar mergers of low- to intermediate-mass stars (from $\approx$ 1.4 to $\approx$ 8 $\text{M}_{\odot}$) and for B-type stars in particular. We analysed two sets of N-body simulations with different initial orbital period distributions. In the simulations, more massive binaries are treated differently than less massive binaries and the mass limit usually used is 5 $\text{M}_{\odot}$. We also used the value of 2 $\text{M}_{\odot}$ to test the influence of this ambiguous limit on the results. Looking at mass, distance from their birth cluster, and velocity distributions, we investigated the statistical significance of individual spectral types in terms of merger dynamics and how merger events affect the stellar evolution. We found that around 50 \% of stars in the simulated open clusters involved in the formation of mergers are B-type stars. As a result, more than 50 \% of the merger products end up as a B-type star as well. Between 12.54 \% and 23.24 \% of all B-type stars are mergers. These results are a natural consequence of the initial mass function, initial distribution of the binary star parameters, and large range of masses for B-type stars. We present a comparison of the W component and the space velocity of the simulated mergers with a sample of observed FS CMa stars.</description>

      <title>The next step in galaxy cluster strong lensing: modeling the surface brightness of multiply-imaged sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming both modeling and computational challenges, we present, for the first time, the extended surface-brightness distribution model of a strongly-lensed source in a complex galaxy-cluster-scale system. We exploit the high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and extensive Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopy to build an extended strong-lensing model, in a full multi-plane formalism, of SDSS J1029+2623, a lens cluster at $z = 0.588$ with three multiple images of a background quasar ($z = 2.1992$). Going beyond typical cluster strong-lensing modeling techniques, we include as observables both the positions of 26 pointlike multiple images from seven background sources, spanning a wide redshift range between 1.02 and 5.06, and the extended surface-brightness distribution of the strongly-lensed quasar host galaxy, over $\sim78000$ HST pixels. In addition, we model the light distribution of seven objects, angularly close to the strongly-lensed quasar host, over $\sim9300$ HST pixels. Our extended lens model reproduces well both the observed intensity and morphology of the quasar host galaxy in the HST F160W band (with a 0''.03 pixel scale). The reconstructed source shows a single, compact, and smooth surface-brightness distribution, for which we estimate an intrinsic magnitude of 23.3 $\pm$ 0.1 in the F160W band and a half-light radius of (2.39 $\pm$ 0.03) kpc. The increased number of observables enables the accurate determination of the total mass of line-of-sight halos lying angularly close to the extended arc. This work paves the way for a new generation of galaxy cluster strong-lens models, where additional, complementary lensing observables are directly incorporated as model constraints.</description>

      <title>Merian: A Wide-Field Imaging Survey of Dwarf Galaxies at z~0.06-0.10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Merian Survey, an optical imaging survey optimized for studying the physical properties of bright star-forming dwarf galaxies. Merian is carried out with two medium-band filters ($N708$ and $N540$, centered at $708$ and $540$ nm), custom-built for the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco telescope. Merian covers $\sim 750\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of equatorial fields, overlapping with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) wide, deep, and ultra-deep fields. When combined with the HSC-SSP imaging data ($grizy$), the new Merian DECam medium-band imaging allows for photometric redshift measurements via the detection of H$\rm\alpha$ and [OIII] line emission flux excess in the $N708$ and $N540$ filters, respectively, at $0.06&lt;z&lt;0.10$. We present an overview of the survey design, observations taken to date, data reduction using the LSST Science Pipelines, including aperture-matched photometry for accurate galaxy colors, and a description of the data included in the first data release (DR1). The key science goals of Merian include: probing the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies out to their virial radii using high signal-to-noise weak lensing profile measurements, decoupling the effects of baryonic processes from dark matter, and understanding the role of black holes in dwarf galaxy evolution. This rich dataset will also offer unique opportunities for studying extremely metal-poor galaxies via their strong [OIII] emission and H$\rm\alpha$ lines, as well as [OIII] emitters at $z\sim 0.4$, and Ly$\rm\alpha$ emitters at $z\sim 3.3$ and $z\sim 4.8$. Merian showcases the power of utilizing narrow and medium-band filters alongside broad-band filters for sky imaging, demonstrating their synergistic capacity to unveil astrophysical insights across diverse astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Morphological Analysis of H$\alpha$ Emission in Bright Dwarfs Using the Merian Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using medium-band imaging from the newly released Merian Survey, we conduct a nonparametric morphological analysis of H$\alpha$ emission maps and stellar continua for a sample of galaxies with $8\lesssim\log (M_\star/M_\odot) &lt; 10.3$ at $0.064&lt;z&lt;0.1$. We present a novel method for estimating the stellar continuum emission through the Merian Survey's N708 medium-band filter, which we use to measure H$\alpha$ emission and produce H$\alpha$ maps for our sample of galaxies with seven-band Merian photometry and available spectroscopy. We measure nonparametric morphological statistics for the H$\alpha$ and stellar continuum images, explore how the morphology of the H$\alpha$ differs from the continuum, and investigate how the parameters evolve with the galaxies' physical properties. In agreement with previous results for more massive galaxies, we find that the asymmetry of the stellar continuum increases with specific star formation rate (SSFR) and we extend the trend to lower masses, also showing that it holds for the asymmetry of the H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the lowest-mass galaxies with the highest SSFR have H$\alpha$ emission that is consistently heterogeneous and compact, while the less active galaxies in this mass range have H$\alpha$ emission that appears diffuse. At higher masses, our data do not span a sufficient range in SSFR to evaluate whether similar trends apply. We conclude that high SSFRs in low-mass galaxies likely result from dynamical instabilities that compress a galaxy's molecular gas to a dense region near the center.</description>

      <title>The formation, evolution and disruption of star clusters with improved gravitational dynamics in simulated dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, even the highest resolution galaxy formation simulations with gravitational softening have failed to reproduce realistic life cycles of star clusters. We present the first star-by-star galaxy models of star cluster formation to account for hydrodynamics, star formation, stellar evolution and collisional gravitational interactions between stars and compact remnants using the updated SPHGAL+KETJU code, part of the GRIFFIN-project. Gravitational dynamics in the vicinity of $&gt;3$ M$_\odot$ stars and their remnants are solved with a regularised integrator (KETJU) without gravitational softening. Comparisons of idealised star cluster evolution with SPHGAL+KETJU and direct N-body show broad agreement and the failure of simulations that use gravitational softening. In the hydrodynamical dwarf galaxy simulations run with SPHGAL+KETJU, clusters up to $\sim900$ M$_\odot$ are formed compact (effective radii $0.1-1$ pc) and their sizes increase by up to a factor of ten in agreement with previous N-body simulations and the observed sizes of exposed star clusters. The sizes increase rapidly once the clusters become exposed due to photoionising radiation. On average $63\%$ of the gravitationally bound clusters disrupt during the first $100$ Myr of evolution in the galactic tidal field. The addition of collisional dynamics reduces the fraction of supernovae in bound clusters by a factor of $\sim 2.6$, however the global star formation and outflow histories change by less than $30\%$. We demonstrate that the accurate treatment of gravitational encounters with massive stars enables more realistic star cluster life cycles from the earliest stages of cluster formation until disruption in simulated low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Burstiness of Star Formation at $z\sim6$: A Huge Diversity in the Recent Star Formation Histories of Very UV-faint Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IRAC data have long implied that early ($z\gtrsim6$) galaxies often have very high specific star formation rates (sSFR$\gtrsim$30 Gyr$^{-1}$), but JWST data have shown that at least some early galaxies are forming stars far less vigorously. Here, we systematically analyze the recent star formation histories (SFHs) of a large ($N=368$) sample of $z\sim6$ Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) spanning $-22\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV}\lesssim-16$ assembled from ACS+NIRCam imaging in the GOODS and Abell 2744 fields. We find that very low H$\alpha$-to-UV luminosity ratios ($L_\mathrm{H\alpha}/L_\mathrm{UV}$) and strong recent downturns in star formation rate (SFR) are $\approx$5$\times$ more common among the UV-faintest subset of our sample ($\langle M_\mathrm{UV}\rangle=-17.4$) compared to the brightest subset ($\langle M_\mathrm{UV}\rangle=-20.0$). The frequency of high $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}/L_\mathrm{UV}$ and strong recent SFR upturns is approximately constant with UV luminosity. We discuss how bursty SFHs naturally reproduce this much greater diversity in recent SFHs among very UV-faint galaxies. Using public NIRSpec/prism data, we newly confirm recent strong SFR downturns among three LBGs in our sample, and validate our photometric inferences on key SFH signatures among $z\sim6$ LBGs in general. Our results imply that early galaxies frequently cycle through phases of rapid stellar mass assembly and other periods of much slower growth. This yields huge ($\gtrsim$1-2 mag) fluctuations in $M_\mathrm{UV}$ on rapid ($\sim$10-30 Myr) timescales, helping explain the surprising abundance of $z&gt;10$ galaxies. Finally, we caution that this burstiness causes all existing high-redshift samples (particularly line-selected samples) to be far less complete to galaxies with long recent phases of low sSFR than those currently undergoing a burst.</description>

      <title>The formation histories of massive and quiescent galaxies in the 3 &lt; z &lt; 4.5 Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the formation histories of 19 massive ($\gtrsim3\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot$) quiescent galaxy candidates at $z\sim3.0-4.5$ observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 $K$-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys \citep{Schreiber2018}. Utilizing Prism $1-5\mu$m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at $z&gt;3$, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of $\sim1.4\times10^{-5}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$ between $z\sim3-4$. Rest-frame $U-V$ vs $V-J$ color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of $\sim90\%$. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed $\sim6\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot$ by $z\sim10$ and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at $z\sim3.2$. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, wavelength range, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. The assumed SFH prior, however, influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated $z\sim3$ quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and photometric confirmation of 3 globular and 14 intermediate-age clusters in the Irr II galaxy NGC3077</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from spectroscopic and photometric analysis of 17 globular cluster (GC) candidates in the Irr II galaxy NGC 3077. The GC candidates were selected on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and were cleaned of foreground Galactic stars using the GAIA parameters. We carried out aperture photometry using the multi-band archival images from SDSS, and 2MASS of all candidates, and low resolution (R= 1000) spectroscopic observations of 12 GC candidates and three suspected foreground stars using the OSIRIS/MOS mode at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Age, metallicity and extinction values were determined both using spectroscopic and photometric data, independently. We find three of the 17 candidates are old (age &gt;10 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.0 dex), massive (mass&gt;10^5 Msun) GCs with characteristics similar to the classical GCs in the Milky Way. The rest are intermediate-age clusters (IACs) with typical ages of 3 to 4 Gyr, and in general metal-rich clusters. The radial velocities of both populations are within 100 km/s of the recessional velocity of the host galaxy. A relatively large population of IACs and low value of GC specific frequency (Sn=0.7) suggest that the pre-interaction galaxy was actively forming stars and star clusters, and is unlikely to be a dE as suggested in some previous works.</description>

      <title>The spatially resolved relation between dust, gas, and metal abundance with the TYPHOON survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spatially resolved relationship between the dust-to-gas mass ratio (DGR) and gas-phase metallicity (Zgas or 12+log(O/H)) (i.e., DGR-Zgas relation) of 11 nearby galaxies with a large metallicity range (1.5 dex of 12+log(O/H)) at (sub-)kpc scales. We used the large field-of-view (&gt; 3') optical pseudo-Integral Field Spectroscopy data taken by the TYPHOON/PrISM survey, covering the optical size of galaxies, combining them with multi-wavelength data (far-UV to far-IR, CO, and HI 21 cm radio). A large scatter of DGR in the intermediate metallicity galaxies (8.0 &lt; 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.3) is found, which is in line with dust evolution models, where grain growth begins to dominate the mechanism of dust mass accumulation. In the lowest metallicity galaxy of our sample, Sextans A (12+log(O/H) &lt; 7.6), the star-forming regions have significantly higher DGR values (by 0.5-2 dex) than the global estimates from literature at the same metallicity but aligns with the DGR values from metal depletion method from Damped Lyman Alpha systems and high hydrogen gas density regions of Sextans A. Using dust evolution models with a Bayesian MCMC approach suggests: 1) a high SN dust yield and 2) a negligible amount of photofragmentation by UV radiation, although we note that our sample in the low-metallicity regime is limited to Sextans A. On the other hand, it is also possible that while metallicity influences DGR, gas density also plays a role, indicating an early onset of dust grain growth in the dust mass build-up process despite its low metallicity.</description>

      <title>The mass and redshift dependence of halo star clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt the two point correlation function (2PCF) as a statistical tool to quantify the spatial clustering of halo stars, for galaxy systems spanning a wide range in host halo virial mass ($11.25&lt;\log_{10}M_{200c}/\mathrm{M}_\odot&lt;15$) and redshifts ($0&lt;z&lt;1.5$) from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Consistent with a previous study \cite[][Paper I]{2024ApJ...961..223Z}, we identify clear correlations between the strength of the 2PCF signals and galaxy formation redshifts, but over a much wider mass range. We find that such correlations are slightly stronger at higher redshifts, and get weakened with the increase of host halo mass. We demonstrate that the spatial clustering of halo stars is affected by two factors: 1) the clustering gets gradually weakened as time passes (phase mixing); 2) newly accreted stars at more recent times would increase the clustering. For more massive galaxy systems, they assemble late and the newly accreted stars would increase the clustering. The late assembly of massive systems may also help to explain the weaker correlations between the 2PCF signals and the galaxy formation redshifts in massive halos, as their 2PCFs are affected more by recently accreted stars, while formation redshift characterizes mass accretion on a much longer timescale. We find that the orbits of satellite galaxies in more massive halos maintain larger radial anisotropy, reflecting the more active accretion state of their hosts while also contributing to their stronger mass loss rates.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>Effects of grain temperature distribution on organic protostellar envelope chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Dust grains in circumstellar envelopes are likely to have a spread-out temperature distribution. Aims. To investigate how trends in temperature distribution between small and large grains affect the hot corino chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) and warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC). Methods. A multi-grain multi-layer astrochemical code with an up-to-date treatment of surface chemistry was used with three grain temperature trends: grain temperature proportional to grain radius to the power -1/6 (Model M-1/6), to 0 (M0), and to 1/6 (M1/6). The cases of hot corino and WCCC chemistry were investigated, for a total of six models. The essence of these changes is for the main ice reservoir - small grains - having higher (M-1/6) or lower (M1/6) temperature than the surrounding gas. Results. The chemistry of COMs shows better agreement with observations in models M-1/6 and M1/6 than in Model M0. Model M-1/6 shows best agreement for WCCC because earlier mass-evaporation of methane ice from small grains induces the WCCC phenomenon at lower temperatures. Conclusions. Models considering several grain populations with different temperatures can more precisely reproduce circumstellar chemistry.</description>

      <title>eDIG-CHANGES III: the lagging eDIG revealed by multi-slit spectroscopy of NGC 891</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematic information of the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) around galaxies provides clues to the origin of the gas. The eDIG-CHANGES project studies the physical and kinematic properties of the eDIG around the CHANG-ES sample of nearby edge-on disk galaxies. We use a novel multi-slit narrow-band spectroscopy technique to obtain the spatial distribution of spectral properties of the ionized gas around NGC 891, which is often regarded as an analog of the Milky Way. We developed specific data reduction procedures for the multi-slit narrow-band spectroscopy data taken with the MDM 2.4m telescope. The data presented in this paper covers the H$\alpha$ and [N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583\AA emission lines. The eDIG traced by the H$\alpha$ and [N II] lines shows an obvious asymmetric morphology, being brighter in the northeastern part of the galactic disk and extending a few kpc above and below the disk. Global variations in the [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio suggest additional heating mechanisms for the eDIG at large heights beyond photoionization. We also construct position-velocity (PV) diagrams of the eDIG based on our optical multi-slit spectroscopy data and compare them to similar PV diagrams constructed with the H I data. The dynamics of the two gas phases are generally consistent with each other. Modeling the rotation curves at different heights from the galactic mid-plane suggests a vertical negative gradient in turnover radius and maximum rotation velocity, with magnitudes of approximately $3$ kpc kpc$^{-1}$ and $22-25$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. Measured vertical gradients of the rotation curve parameters suggest significant differential rotation of the ionized gas in the halo, or often referred to as the lagging eDIG. Systematic study of the lagging eDIG in our eDIG-CHANGES project, will help us to better understand the dynamics of the ionized gas in the halo.</description>

      <title>Rare Occasions: Tidal Disruption Events Rarely Power the AGNs Observed in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) could be an important growth channel for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies. Theoretical work suggests that the observed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies are predominantly TDE-powered. To assess this claim, we perform variability analyses on the dwarf-hosted AGNs detected in the $7$ Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey, with observations spanning $\approx 16$ years. Based on the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling with X-CIGALE, we select AGNs hosted by dwarf galaxies (stellar mass below $10^{10}\ M_\odot$). We focus on X-ray sources with full-band detections, leading to a sample of $78$ AGNs (0.122 $\leq$ $z$ $\leq$ 3.515). We fit the X-ray light curves with a canonical TDE model of $t^{-5/3}$ and a constant model. If the former outperforms the latter in fitting quality for a source, we consider the source as a potential TDE. We identify five potential TDEs, constituting a small fraction of our sample. Using true- and false-positive rates obtained from fitting models to simulated light curves, we perform Bayesian analysis to obtain the posterior of the TDE fraction for our sample. The posterior peaks close to zero ($2.56\%$), and we obtain a $2$-$\sigma$ upper limit of $9.80\%$. Therefore, our result indicates that the observed AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not predominantly powered by TDEs.</description>

      <title>LMC Calls, Milky Way Halo Answers: Disentangling the Effects of the MW--LMC Interaction on Stellar Stream Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has dynamical implications throughout the MW's dark matter halo. We study the impact of this merger on the statistical properties of populations of simulated stellar streams. Specifically, we investigate the radial and on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations caused by the direct effect of stream-LMC interactions and/or the response of the MW dark matter halo. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions to simulate streams. We quantify the degree of perturbation using a set of stream property statistics including the misalignment of proper motions with the stream track. In the outer halo, direct stream--LMC interactions produce a statistically significant effect, boosting the fraction of misaligned proper motions by ~25% compared to the model with no LMC. Moreover, there is on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations:~the highest fractions of perturbed streams coincide with the same on-sky quadrant as the present-day LMC location. In the inner halo, the MW halo dipole response primarily drives stream perturbations, but it remains uncertain whether this is a detectable signature distinct from the LMC's influence. For the fiducial MW--LMC model, we find agreement between the predicted fraction of streams with significantly misaligned proper motions, $\bar{\vartheta}&gt;10^{\circ}$, and Dark Energy Survey data. Finally, we predict this fraction for the Vera Rubin Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) footprint. Using LSST data will improve our constraints on dark matter models and LMC properties as it is sensitive to both.</description>

      <title>AGN STROM 2: X. The origin of the interband continuum delays in Mrk 817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local (z=0.0315) AGN Mrk 817, was monitored over more than 500 days with space-borne and ground-based instruments as part of a large international campaign AGN STORM 2. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the broad-band continuum variations using detailed modeling of the broad line region (BLR), several types of disk winds classified by their optical depth, and new numerical simulations. We find that diffuse continuum (DC) emission, with additional contributions from strong and broad emission lines, can explain the continuum lags observed in this source during high and low luminosity phases. Disk illumination by the variable X-ray corona contributes only a small fraction of the observed continuum lags. Our BLR models assume radiation pressure-confined clouds distributed over a distance of 2-122 light days. We present calculated mean-emissivity radii of many emission lines, and DC emission, and suggest a simple, transfer-function-dependent method that ties them to cross-correlation lag determinations. We do not find clear indications for large optical depth winds but identify the signature of lower column density winds. In particular, we associate the shortest observed continuum lags with a combination of tau(1 Ryd) approx. 2 wind and a partly shielded BLR. Even smaller optical depth winds may be associated with X-ray absorption features and with noticeable variations in the width and lags of several high ionization lines like HeII and CIV. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of torus dust emission on the observed lags in the i and z bands.</description>

      <title>Extinction of Taurus, Orion, Perseus and California Molecular Clouds Based on the LAMOST, 2MASS, and Gaia Surveys II: The Extinction Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extinction law from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) (0.2-24 $\mu$m) is determined by relying on the blue-edge method and color excess ratios for some nearby molecular clouds, from low mass star forming region to massive star forming region. The observational data are collected from nine photometric surveys, along with stellar parameters from the APOGEE and LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Within the uncertainties, the optical ratio of selective to total extinction ($R_{G_{BP}}$) does not vary substantially across the clouds, irrespective of the density, specifically $R_{G_{BP}} =2.302\pm0.027$, where $R_{G_{BP}} \equiv A_{G_{BP}}/E_{G_{BP},G_{RP}}$. The IR extinction law is consistent with \citet{Wang19_law}. The extinction law in the UV band is compromised by the shallow depth with $A_{V} \leq 2$ mag and is hard to describe by one parameter $R$. In addition, the extinction in the WISE/W1 band is significantly larger than in the Spitzer/IRAC1 band in the dense regions, which is attributed to the ice water absorption.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Reflection Modeling in AGN and Related Variability from PCA: A Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic reflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which contain general-relativistic footprints caused by spinning supermassive black holes (SMBH). We anticipate the spin of a SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe, so brightness changes in the high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly alter relativistic reflection. In this brief review, we discuss the latest developments in modeling relativistic reflection, as well as the rapid small variation in relativistic emission disclosed by the principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray variability in AGN. PCA studies of X-ray spectra from AGNs have shown that relativistically blurred reflection has negligible fluctuations over the course of observations, which could originate from rapid (intrahour) intrinsic variations in near-horizon accretion flows and photon rings. The PCA technique is an effective way to disclose relativistic reflection from X-ray observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of largely variable X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Ejected from home: C/1980 E1 (Bowell) and C/2024 L5 (ATLAS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Natural interstellar objects do not form isolated in deep space, but escape their natal planetary systems. Early removal from their home star systems via close flybys with still-forming planets could be the dominant ejection mechanism. However, dynamically evolved planetary systems such as the Solar System may also be a significant source of natural interstellar objects.
  Aims. We studied the dynamical evolution of two unusual Solar System hyperbolic comets, C/1980 E1 (Bowell) and C/2024 L5 (ATLAS), to investigate the circumstances that led them to reach moderate Solar System excess hyperbolic speeds.
  Methods. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses to explore the planetary encounters that led to the ejection of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5, and studied their pre- and post-encounter trajectories.
  Results. We confirm that C/1980 E1 reached its present path into interstellar space after an encounter with Jupiter at 0.23 au on December 9, 1980. C/2024 L5 was scattered out of the Solar System following a flyby to Saturn at 0.003 au on January 24, 2022. Integrations backward in time show that C/1980 E1 came from the inner Oort cloud but C/2024 L5 could be a former retrograde, inactive Centaur. The receding velocities of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5 when entering interstellar space will be 3.8 and 2.8 km/s, moving towards Aries and Triangulum, respectively.
  Conclusions. Our results for two comets ejected from the Solar System indicate that dynamically evolved planetary systems can be effective sources of interstellar objects and provide constraints on their velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Formation of Stripped Stars From Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</title>

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are an important way to probe the properties of stellar populations surrounding supermassive black holes. Observed spectra of several TDEs, such as ASASSN-14li, show high nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios, leading to questions about their progenitors. Disrupting an intermediate- or high-mass star that has undergone CNO processing, increasing the nitrogen in its core, could lead to an enhanced nitrogen TDE. Galactic nuclei present a conducive environment for high-velocity stellar collisions that can lead to high mass loss, stripping the carbon- and hydrogen-rich envelopes of the stars and leaving behind the enhanced nitrogen cores. TDEs of these stripped stars may therefore exhibit even more extreme nitrogen enhancement. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, we provide a parameter space study of high-velocity stellar collisions involving intermediate-mass stars, analyzing the composition of the collision products. We conclude that high-velocity stellar collisions can form products that have abundance ratios similar to those observed in the motivating TDEs. Furthermore, we show that stars that have not experienced high CNO processing can yield low-mass collision products that retain even higher nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios. We analytically estimate the mass fallback for a typical TDE of several collision products to demonstrate consistency between our models and TDE observations. Lastly, we discuss how the extended collision products, with high central to average density ratios, can be related to repeated partial TDEs like ASASSN-14ko and G objects in the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>The Disk Wind Contribution to the Gamma-Ray emission from the nearby Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734-292</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies have been detected in GeV gamma-rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), but the origin of much of this emission is unclear. We consider the nearby example, the Seyfert galaxy GRS 1734-292, which exhibits weak starburst and jet activities that are insufficient to explain the observed gamma-ray flux. With the first detailed multi-wavelength study of this source, we demonstrate that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk wind can account for its gamma-ray emission. Using a lepto-hadronic emission model based on a shocked ambient medium and a shocked wind region created by an AGN accretion disk wind, we identify two viable scenarios that are consistent with the Fermi-LAT data and multi-wavelength observations: a hadronic pp-dominated scenario and a leptonic external Compton-dominated scenario. Both of these show that future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) could detect TeV emission from a disk wind in GRS 1734-292. Such a detection would substantially improve our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration efficiency in AGN disk wind systems, and would establish radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies as cosmic ray accelerators capable of reaching ultra-high energies.</description>

Abstract: This paper traces the 37 years of my career dedicated to the development of integral field spectroscopy (IFS), highlighting significant milestones and advancements. This extensive journey encompasses three generations of IFS: the initial prototype TIGER at CFHT, the first generation including OASIS at CFHT and SAURON at WHT, the second generation with MUSE at VLT, and the potential third generation represented by the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) project. Throughout, I discuss the lessons learned at each stage and provide my perspective on the future of IFS.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmology with N-body simulations for future spectroscopic galaxy surveys at $2\leq z\leq 3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature ($\Omega_k$) independent of cosmic microwave background observations plays a key role in revealing the physics of the early universe. The Hubble tension is one of the most serious issues in modern cosmology. We investigate halo catalogs identified from $N$-body simulations at $z=2$ and 3, mimicking high-redshift galaxy surveys. We measure redshift-space correlation functions of halos from the two snapshots. We detect clear features of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions. We find that we can obtain a few percent constraints on both the geometric distances and growth of structure at the distant universe in future surveys. By taking into account the information of the underlying matter power spectrum, we demonstrate that we can also achieve constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ with a few percent as well as the spatial curvature with $|\Omega_k|\lesssim 0.1$ by observing galaxies with the number density with $\bar{n}_{\rm g}\simeq 10^{-4} (~h^3{\rm ~Mpc}^{-3})$. Our analysis provides a timely forecast for the upcoming spectroscopic surveys, which target emission line galaxy or dusty star-forming galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical abundance analysis of the very metal-poor halo star HE 2315-4240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning about the chemical evolution of the universe is crucial to understanding the formation of the first stars and structure formation in the early universe. To find out how elements are produced via nucleosynthesis and how their relative amounts have evolved with time, abundance trends of stars with different metallicities can be established and compared. In this study, we present a spectrum of a very metal-poor star, HE 2315$-$4240, with [Fe/H] = $-$2.89 based on a Magellan/MIKE high-resolution visual light spectrum. The star has a radial velocity of +41.9 km s$^{-1}$, an effective temperature of 5181 K, a surface gravity of 2.24 dex, and a microturbulence of 1.61 km s$^{-1}$. The $\alpha$-elements and the iron peak elements agree well with the abundance trend. The low abundance of [Sr/Ba] and [C/Fe] suggests that HE 2315$-$4240 is accreted and formed in a dwarf galaxy. The value of [Ba/Eu] suggests the operation of a limited r-process. The abundance pattern of [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] in HE 2315$-$4240 and its metallicity indicated that the star is formed from the gas enriched by a Type II supernova of a massive Pop III star. The abundance pattern fits Population III supernova yields moderately. The star's kinematic behavior shows that the star has a retrograde orbit and is moving away from the galactic center and out of the galactic disk to the south, and although the star is located in the halo of the Milky Way, it didn't form in the Milky Way but was rather formed in a small dwarf galaxy that was later absorbed by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Mergers as Probes of Dark Matter in Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) from the early Universe that can contribute to dark matter (DM) abundance have been linked to gravitational wave observations. Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies are expected to modify distribution of DM in their vicinity, and can result in highly concentrated DM spikes. We revisit PBH merger rates in the presence of DM spikes, tracking their history. We find novel peaked structure in the redshift-evolution of PBH merger rates at low redshifts around $z \sim 5$. These effects are generic and are present for distinct PBH mass functions and spike profiles, and also can be linked to peaked structure in redshift evolution of star formation rate. Redshift evolution characteristics of PBH merger rates can be distinguished from astrophysical black hole contributions and observable with gravitational waves, enabling them to serve as probes of DM in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Slow it down: axion-photon conversion down to the non-relativistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a magnetic field, axions can convert into photons and viceversa. The phenomenology of the conversion is captured by a system of two coupled Klein-Gordon equations, which, assuming that the axion is relativistic, is usually recast into a pair of first order Schr\"odinger-like equations. In such a limit, focusing on a constant magnetic field and plasma frequency, the equations admit an exact analytic solution. The relativistic limit significantly simplifies the calculations; therefore, it is widely used in phenomenological applications. In this work, we discuss how to evaluate the axion-photon system evolution without relying on such relativistic approximation. In particular, we give an exact analytical solution, valid for any axion energy, in the case that both the magnetic field and plasma frequency are constant. Moreover, we devise an analytic perturbative expansion that allows for tracking the conversion probability in a slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field or plasma frequency, whose characteristic scale of variation is much larger than the typical axion-photon oscillation length. Finally, we discuss a case of resonant axion-photon conversion giving useful simplified formulae that might be directly applied to dark matter axions converting in neutron star magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>The stellar bar - dark matter halo connection in the TNG50 simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar bars in disk galaxies grow as stars in near circular orbits lose angular momentum to their environments, including their Dark Matter (DM) halo, and transform into elongated bar orbits. This angular momentum exchange during galaxy evolution hints at a connection between bar properties and the DM halo spin $\lambda$, the dimensionless form of DM angular momentum. We investigate the connection between halo spin $\lambda$ and galaxy properties in the presence/absence of stellar bars, using the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic TNG50 simulations at multiple redshifts ($0&lt;z_r&lt;1$). We determine the bar strength (or bar amplitude, $A_2/A_0$), using Fourier decomposition of the face-on stellar density distribution. We determine the halo spin for barred and unbarred galaxies ($0&lt;A_2/A_0&lt;0.7$) in the centre of the DM halo, close to the galaxy's stellar disk. At $z_r=0$, there is an anti-correlation between halo spin and bar strength. Strongly barred galaxies ($A_2/A_0&gt;0.4$) reside in DM halos with low spin and low specific angular momentum at their centers. In contrast, unbarred/weakly barred galaxies ($A_2/A_0&lt;0.2$) exist in halos with higher central spin and higher specific angular momentum. The anti-correlation is due to the barred galaxies' higher DM mass and lower angular momentum than the unbarred galaxies at $z_r=0$, as a result of galaxy evolution. At high redshifts ($z_r=1$), all galaxies have higher halo spin compared to those at lower redshifts ($z_r=0$), with a weak anti-correlation for galaxies having $A_2/A_0&gt; 0.2$. The formation of a DM bar in strongly barred systems highlights how angular momentum transfer to the halo can influence its central spin.</description>

Abstract: The Near-infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope is uniquely suited to studying galaxies in the distant Universe with its combination of multi-object capabilities and sensitivity over a large range in wavelength (0.6-5.3 microns). Here we present the NIRSpec Wide survey, part of the NIRSpec Instrument Science Team's Guaranteed Time Observations, using NIRSpec's microshutter array to obtain spectra of more than 3200 galaxies at $z&gt;1$ at both low- and high-resolution ($R\approx100$ and 2700) for a total of 105 hours. With 31 pointings covering $\approx$320 arcmin$^2$ across the five CANDELS fields with exquisite ancillary photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope, the NIRSpec Wide survey represents a fast and efficient way of using JWST to probe galaxies in the early Universe. Pointing centers are determined to maximize the observability of the rarest, high-value sources. Subsequently, the microshutter configurations are optimized to observe the maximum number of "census" galaxies with a selection function based primarily on HST/F160W magnitude, photometric/slitless grism redshift, and predicted \ha\ flux tracing the bulk of the galaxy population at cosmic noon ($z_{\rm med}=2.0$). We present details on the survey strategy, the target selection, an outline of the motivating science cases, and discuss upcoming public data releases to the community.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Structure Formation: the Early Emergence of Massive Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies in the early universe appear to have grown too big too fast, assembling into massive, monolithic objects more rapidly than anticipated in the hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM structure formation paradigm. The available photometric data are consistent with there being a population of massive galaxies that form early ($z \gtrsim 10$) and quench rapidly over a short ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) timescale, consistent with the traditional picture for the evolution of giant elliptical galaxies. Similarly, kinematic observations as a function of redshift show that massive spirals and their scaling relations were in place at early times. Explaining the early emergence of massive galaxies requires either an extremely efficient conversion of baryons into stars at $z&gt;10$ or a more rapid assembly of baryons than anticipated in $\Lambda$CDM. The latter possibility was explicitly predicted in advance by MOND. We discuss some further predictions of MOND, such as the early emergence of clusters of galaxies and early reionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tracer sample in a gravitational potential, starting from a generic initial condition, phase-mixes towards a stationary state. This evolution is accompanied by an entropy increase, and the final state is characterized by a distribution function (DF) that depends only on integrals of motion (Jeans theorem). We present a method to constrain a gravitational potential where a sample is stationary by minimizing the entropy the sample would have if it were allowed to phase-mix in trial potentials. This method avoids assuming a known DF, and is applicable to any sets of integrals. We provide expressions for the entropy of DFs depending on energy, $f(E)$, energy and angular momentum, $f(E,L)$, or three actions, $f(\vec{J})$, and investigate the bias and fluctuations in their estimates. We show that the method correctly recovers the potential parameters for spherical and axisymmetric models. We also present a methodology to characterize the posterior probability distribution of the parameters with an Approximate Bayesian Computation, indicating a pathway for application to observational data. Using $N=10^4$ tracers with $20\%$-uncertainties in the 6D coordinates, we recover the flattening parameter $q$ of an axisymmetric potential with $\sigma_q/q\sim 10\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of galaxies is significantly influenced by galactic winds, possibly driven by cosmic rays due to their long cooling times and better coupling to plasma compared to radiation. In this study, we compare the radio observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4217 from the CHANG-ES collaboration catalog with a mock observation of an isolated galaxy based on the arepo simulation that adopts the state-of-the-art two-moment cosmic ray transport treatment and multiphase interstellar medium model. We find significant agreement between the simulated and observed images and spectroscopic data for reasonable model parameters. Specifically, we find that (i) the shape of the intensity profiles depends weakly on the magnitude of the magnetic field, the distance of the simulated galaxy, and the normalization of the CR electron spectrum. The agreement between the mock and actual observations is degenerate with respect to these factors; (ii) the multi-wavelength spectrum above 0.1 GHz is in agreement with the radio observations and its slope is also only weakly sensitive to the magnetic field strength; (iii) the magnetic field direction exhibits X-shaped morphology, often seen in edge-on galaxies, which is consistent with the observations and indicates the presence of a galactic-scale outflow. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating advanced cosmic ray transport models in simulations and provide a deeper understanding of galactic wind dynamics and its impact on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>MAGICS II. Seed black holes stripped of their surrounding stars do not sink</title>

Abstract: MBH seed mergers are expected to be among the loudest sources of gravitational waves detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), providing a unique window into the birth and early growth of SMBH. We present the MAGICS-II simulation suite, consisting of 6 galaxy mergers that result in MBH seeds mergers identified in the cosmological simulation ASTRID. With the enhanced resolution (mass resolution: 500 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$; softening length: $5$ pc), improved subgrid models for the MBH dynamics and accretion, and the accurate regularized gravity integrator included in KETJU, we trace MBH seeds dynamics down to 0.1 pc. After evolving all the systems for $\approx$ 1.2 Gyr in three stages (MAGICS-2000, MAGICS-500, and MAGICS-K), we find in 4 of the 6 systems the MBHs stall at separations $ \Delta r \gtrsim 200$ pc. Only in 2 systems, the MBHs manage to sink further, and only in one of them a bound binary forms. In the sinking systems, the MBH retains a population of bound stars. The final separation between the MBH is related to the surrounding unstripped stellar (and/or dark matter) mass: if more than 90\% of the surrounding stellar system is stripped away, the MBHs stall. Besides the unstripped stars from the original host galaxy, we find that newly formed stars bound to the MBH significantly contribute to its sinking. Resolving the stellar system around MBH seeds, and its induced tidal interactions and dynamical friction is key for accurately capturing MBH dynamics. For this, high resolution simulations are required. In a companion paper (MAGICS-III), we resimulate the central regions of these systems with increased resolution to model directly the effects of actual star clusters around MBHs.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: An Extraordinarily Mature, Star-forming Galaxy at $z\sim 7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z_spec=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature, whereas the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratio suggests roughly 50% solar metallicity. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ haloes before reionization are detectable with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope \ (JWST)$ recently reported a large population of UV luminous galaxies at high redshifts, $ z &gt; 10$, as well as Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting (LAE) galaxies out to $z \sim 11$. We use the observed UV luminosities along with a data-driven approach at lower redshifts to place constraints on the observability of the intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity, scattered in the form of Loeb-Rybicki haloes, during the pre-reionization and reionization epochs ($z \sim 9-16$). We forecast the sensitivity and resolution required to detect these intergalactic haloes, finding that individual haloes with LAE luminosities $&gt; 10^{43}$ ergs/s are detectable at a few sigma level at $z \lesssim 9$, while stacking of $\sim 10$ haloes is expected to result in detections out to $z \sim 16$. Finding these haloes is expected to shed light on the neutral intergalactic hydrogen during cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Fifth Data Release from the Search for R-Process-Enhanced Metal-poor Stars in the Galactic Halo with the GTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the abundance pattern of metal-poor stars and the production of heavy elements through various nucleosynthesis processes offers crucial insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, revealing primary sites and major sources of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) material in the Universe. In this fifth data release from the $R$-Process Alliance, we present the detailed chemical abundances of 41 faint (down to V = 15.8) and extremely metal-poor (down to [Fe/H] = -3.3) halo stars selected from the R-Process Alliance (RPA). We obtained high-resolution spectra for these objects with the HORuS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We measure the abundances of light, alpha, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We report the discovery of five CEMP, one limited-$r$, three $r$-I, and four $r$-II stars, and six Mg-poor stars. We also identify one star of a possible globular cluster origin at an extremely low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -3.0. This adds to the growing evidence of a lower limit metallicity floor for globular cluster abundances. We use the abundances of Fe-peak elements and the alpha-elements to investigate the contributions from different nucleosynthesis channels in the progenitor supernovae. We find the distribution of [Mg/Eu] as a function of [Fe/H] to have different enrichment levels, indicating different possible pathways and sites of their production. We also reveal differences in the trends of the neutron-capture element abundances of Sr, Ba, and Eu of various $r$-I and $r$-II stars from the RPA data releases, which provide constraints on their nucleosynthesis sites and subsequent evolution.</description>
