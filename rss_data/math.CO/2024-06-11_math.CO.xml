      <title>The Generating graph of Dicyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a group $G,$ the generating graph of $G,$ denoted by $\Gamma(G).$ We define $Q_n=\langle x,y: x^{2n}=y^4=1, x^n=y^2,y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}\rangle,$ the dicyclic group of order $4n.$ This paper primarily delves into exploring the graph characteristics and spectral properties of various matrices associated with $\Gamma(Q_n)$. Specifically, we determine the complete spectrum of the adjacency, Laplacian, distance, and eccentricity matrices. Additionally, we completely determine the spectrum pertaining to the distance and eccentricity matrices of the dihedral group of order $2n$, denoted as $D_n$.</description>

      <title>A quantum Murnaghan--Nakayama rule for the flag manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rule for the multiplication of a Schubert class by a tautological
  class in the (small) quantum cohomology ring of the flag manifold.
  As an intermediate step, we establish a formula for the multiplication of
  a Schubert class by a quantum Schur polynomial indexed by a hook partition.
  This entails a detailed analysis of chains and intervals in the
  quantum Bruhat order.
  This analysis allows us to use results of Leung--Li and of Postnikov to reduce quantum
  products by hook Schur polynomials to the (known) classical product.</description>

      <title>Schubert coefficients of sparse paving matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chow class of the closure of the torus orbit of a point in a Grassmannian only depends on the matroid associated to the point. The Chow class can be extended to a matroid invariant of arbitrary matroids. We call the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the Chow class in the Schubert basis the Schubert coefficients of the matroid. These Schubert coefficients are conjectured by Berget and Fink to be non-negative. We compute the Schubert coefficients for all sparse paving matroids, and confirm their non-negativity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normality of pattern occurrences in random maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the limiting distribution of special {\it additive functionals} on random planar maps, namely the number of occurrences of a given {\it pattern}. The main result is a central limit theorem for these pattern counts in the case of pattern with a simple boundary. The proof relies on a combination of analytic and combinatorial methods together with a moment method due to Gao and Wormald~\cite{GaoWormald}. It is an important issue to handle the overlap structure of two pattern which is the main difficulty in the proof.</description>

      <title>TAR reconfiguration for vertex set parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys results about token addition and removal (TAR) reconfiguration for several well-known vertex set parameters including domination, power domination, standard zero forcing, and PSD zero forcing. We also expand the range of parameters to which universal $X$-set TAR graph results apply, for $X$-sets and their TAR graphs introduced in [B. Bjorkman, C. Bozeman, D. Ferrero, M. Flagg, C. Grood, L. Hogben, B. Jacob, C. Reinhart, Power domination reconfiguration, arXiv:2201.01798] and [N.H. Bong, J. Carlson, B. Curtis, R. Haas, L. Hogben, Isomorphisms and properties of TAR reconfiguration graphs for zero forcing and other $X$-set parameters, \emph{Graphs Combin.} {39} (2023), Paper No. 86]. Here we examine which of the $X$-set axioms are needed for which results. The main results apply to skew zero forcing and vertex covering, and results about TAR reconfiguration graphs of these parameters are presented. While $X$-sets are defined for parameters that take the minimum cardinality over the $X$-sets of a graph, and $X$-set results are restricted to such minimizing parameters, our expansion of the universal perspective allows these results to be applied to parameters that take the maximum value among relevant sets, called $Y$-sets. Maximizing parameters to which the main results apply include independence number, (upper) irredundance number, and (upper) zero forcing irredundance number, and failed zero forcing number; TAR reconfiguration results are presented for these parameters. We also show that the equivalence of connectedness in certain token jumping reconfiguration graphs and certain TAR reconfiguration graphs for independent sets established in [M. Kami\'nski, P. Medvedev, M. Milani\v c. Complexity of independent set reconfiguration problems. {\em J. Theoretical Computer Science} 439 (2012), 9--15.] extends to $X$-set and $Y$-set parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal k-centers of a graph: a control-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a network consisting of n nodes, our goal is to identify the most central k nodes with respect to the proposed definitions of centrality. Depending on the specific application, there exist several metrics for quantifying k-centrality, and the subset of the best k nodes naturally varies based on the chosen metric. In this paper, we propose two metrics and establish connections to a well-studied metric from the literature (specifically for stochastic matrices). We prove these three notions match for path graphs. We then list a few more control-theoretic notions and compare these various notions for a general randomly generated graph. Our first metric involves maximizing the shift in the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. This shift can be interpreted as an improvement in the time constant when the RC circuit experiences leakage at certain k capacitors. The second metric focuses on minimizing the Perron root of a principal sub-matrix of a stochastic matrix, an idea proposed and interpreted in the literature as manufacturing consent. The third one explores minimizing the Perron root of a perturbed (now super-stochastic) matrix, which can be seen as minimizing the impact of added stubbornness. It is important to emphasize that we consider applications (for example, facility location) when the notions of central ports are such that the set of the best k ports does not necessarily contain the set of the best k-1 ports. We apply our k-port selection metric to various network structures. Notably, we prove the equivalence of three definitions for a path graph and extend the concept of central port linkage beyond Fiedler vectors to other eigenvectors associated with path graphs.</description>

      <title>A spectral Erd\H{o}s-Rademacher theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Erd\H{o}s and Rademacher (1955) indicates a supersaturation phenomenon. It says that if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\lfloor {n^2}/{4} \rfloor +1$ edges, then $G$ contains at least $\lfloor {n}/{2}\rfloor$ triangles. We prove a spectral version of Erd\H{o}s--Rademacher's theorem. Moreover, Mubayi [Adv. Math. 225 (2010)] extends the result of Erd\H{o}s and Rademacher from a triangle to any color-critical graph. It is interesting to study the extension of Mubayi from a spectral perspective. However, it is not apparent to measure the increment on the spectral radius of a graph comparing to the traditional edge version (Mubayi's result). In this paper, we provide a way to measure the increment on the spectral radius of a graph and propose a spectral version on the counting problems for color-critical graphs.</description>

      <title>Finding irregular subgraphs via local adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $H$, let $m(H,k)$ denote the number of vertices of degree $k$ in $H$. A conjecture of Alon and Wei states that for any $d\geq 3$, every $n$-vertex $d$-regular graph contains a spanning subgraph $H$ satisfying $|m(H,k)-\frac{n}{d+1}|\leq 2$ for every $0\leq k \leq d$. This holds easily when $d\leq 2$. An asymptotic version of this conjecture was initially established by Frieze, Gould, Karo\'nski and Pfender, subsequently improved by Alon and Wei, and most recently enhanced by Fox, Luo and Pham, approaching its complete range. All of these approaches relied on probabilistic methods.
  In this paper, we provide a novel framework to study this conjecture, based on localized deterministic techniques which we call local adjustments. We prove two main results. Firstly, we show that every $n$-vertex $d$-regular graph contains a spanning subgraph $H$ satisfying $|m(H,k)-\frac{n}{d+1}|\leq 2d^2$ for all $0\leq k \leq d$, which provides the first bound independent of the value of $n$. Secondly, we confirm the case $d=3$ of the Alon-Wei Conjecture in a strong form. Both results can be generalized to multigraphs and yield efficient algorithms for finding the desired subgraphs $H$. Furthermore, we explore a generalization of the Alon-Wei Conjecture for multigraphs and its connection to the Faudree-Lehel Conjecture concerning irregularity strength.</description>

      <title>Strong stability from vertex-extendability and applications in generalized Tur\'{a}n problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the work of Liu--Mubayi--Reiher~\cite{LMR23unif} on hypergraph Tur\'{a}n problems, we introduce the notion of vertex-extendability for general extremal problems on hypergraphs and develop an axiomatized framework for proving strong stability for extremal problems satisfying certain properties. This framework simplifies the typically complex and tedious process of obtaining stability and exact results for extremal problems into a much simpler task of verifying their vertex-extendability.
  We present several applications of this method in generalized Tur\'{a}n problems including the Erd\H{o}s Pentagon Problem, hypergraph Tur\'{a}n-goodness, and generalized Tur\'{a}n problems of hypergraphs whose shadow is complete multipartite. These results significantly strengthen and extend previous results of Erd\H{o}s~\cite{Erdos62}, Gy\H{o}ri--J\'{a}nos--Simonovits~\cite{GPS91}, Grzesik~\cite{Gre12}, Hatami--Hladk\'{y}--Kr\'{a}\v{l}--Norine--Razborov~\cite{HHKNR13}, Morrison--Nir--Norin--Rz\k{a}\.{z}ewski--Wesolek~\cite{MNNRPW23}, Gerbner--Palmer~\cite{GP22}, and others.</description>

      <title>The monopole-dimer model on high-dimensional cylindrical, toroidal, M\"obius and Klein grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimer (monomer-dimer) model deals with weighted enumeration of perfect matchings (matchings). The monopole-dimer model is a signed variant of the monomer-dimer model whose partition function is a determinant. In 1999, Lu and Wu evaluated the partition function of the dimer model on two-dimensional grids embedded on a M\"obius strip and a Klein bottle. While the partition function of the dimer model has been known for the two-dimensional grids with different boundary conditions, we present a similar product formula for the partition function of the monopole-dimer model on higher dimensional cylindrical and toroidal grid graphs. We also evaluate the same for the three-dimensional M\"obius and Klein grid graphs and show that the formula does not generalise for the higher dimensions. Further, we present a relation between the product formula for the three-dimensional cylindrical and M\"obius grid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Tur\'an number, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex planar graph which does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. Ghosh, Gy\H{o}ri, Paulos and Xiao initiated the topic of the planar Tur\'an number for double stars. For balanced double star, $S_{3,3}$ is the only remaining graph need to be considered. In this paper, we give the exact value of $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,S_{3,3})$, forcing the planar Tur\'an number for all balanced double stars completely determined.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Moment Method for Regular Graphs I: Kesten-McKay and Semicircle distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the Chebyshev moment method to study the spectrum of regular graphs, motivated by the work of Serr\'e. By this method, we give an elementary proof of the weak convergence to the Kesten-McKay distribution for the normalized spectral measures of random $N$-lifts in probability as $N$ tends to infinity. For a sequence of random $(q_n+1)$-regular graphs $G_n$ with $n$ vertices, we show that if $q_n=n^{o(1)}$ and $q_n$ tends to infinity, then the normalized spectral measure converges in Wasserstein $p$-distance $W_{p}$ to the semicircle distribution for any $p \in [1,\infty)$ almost surely. This strengthens the result of Dumitriu and Pal.</description>

      <title>Broadcast independence and packing in certain classes of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ of diameter $d$, a broadcast is a function $f:V(G) \to \{ 0, 1, \dots, d \}$ where $f(v)$ is at most the eccentricity of $v$. A vertex $v$ is broadcasting if $f(v)&gt;0$ and a vertex $u$ hears $v$ if $d(u,v) \leq f(v)$. A broadcast is independent if no broadcasting vertex hears another vertex and is a packing if no vertex hears more than one vertex. The weight of $f$ is $\sum_{v \in V} f(v)$. We find the maximum weight independent and packing broadcasts for perfect $k$-ary trees, spiders, and double spiders as a partial answer to a question posed by Ahmane et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field. A family $\mathcal{F}$ consisting of $k$-subspcaes of $V$ is called almost $t$-intersecting if for each $F\in \mathcal{F}$ there is at most one $F^{\prime}\in \mathcal{F}$ with $\dim(F\cap F^{\prime})\leq t-1$. In this paper, we determine the maximum value and the extremal structure of almost $t$-intersecting families. We also solve the same problems for almost $t$-intersecting families but not $t$-intersecting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $t$ be a non-negative integer and $\mbox{$\cal P$}=\{(A_i,B_i)\}_{1\leq i\leq m}$ be a set-pair family satisfying $|A_i \cap B_i|\leq t$ for $1\leq i \leq m$. $\mbox{$\cal P$}$ is called strong Bollob\'as $t$-system, if $|A_i\cap B_j|&gt;t$ for all $1\leq i\neq j \leq m$.
  F\"uredi conjectured the following nice generalization of Bollob\'as' Theorem:
  Let $t$ be a non-negative integer. Let $\mbox{$\cal P$}=\{(A_i,B_i)\}_{1\leq i\leq m}$ be a strong Bollob\'as $t$-system. Then $$ \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{{|A_i|+|B_i|-2t \choose |A_i|-t}}\leq 1. $$ We confirmed the following special case of F\"uredi's conjecture along with some more results of similar flavor.

      <description>arXiv:2406.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume $G$ is a graph and $k$ is a positive integer. Let $f:V(G)\to N$ be defined as $f(v)=\min\{k,d_G(v)\}$. If $G$ is $f$-choosable, then we say $G$ is $k$-truncated-degree-choosable. It was proved in [Zhou,Zhu,Zhu, Arc-weighted acyclic orientations and variations of degeneracy of graphs, arXiv:2308.15853] that there is a 3-connected non-complete planar graph that is not 7-truncated-degree-choosable, and every 3-connected non-complete planar graph is 16-truncated-degree-choosable. This paper improves the bounds, and proves that there is a 3-connected non-complete planar graph that is not 8-truncated-degree-choosable and every non-complete 3-connected planar graph is 12-truncated-degree-choosable.</description>

      <title>A characterization of uniquely representable two-directional orthogonal ray graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a characterization of uniquely representable two-directional orthogonal ray graphs, which are defined as the intersection graphs of rightward and downward rays. The collection of these rays is called a representation of the graph. Two-directional orthogonal ray graphs are equivalent to several well-studied classes of graphs, including complements of circular-arc graphs with clique cover number two. Normalized representations of two-directional orthogonal ray graphs, where the positions of certain rays are determined by neighborhood containment relations, can be obtained from the normalized representations of circular-arc graphs. However, the normalized representations are not necessarily unique, even when considering only the relative positions of the rays. Recent studies indicate that two-directional orthogonal ray graphs share similar characterizations to interval graphs. Hanlon (1982) and Fishburn (1985) characterized uniquely representable interval graphs by introducing the notion of a buried subgraph. Following their characterization, we define buried subgraphs of two-directional orthogonal ray graphs and prove that their absence is a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be uniquely representable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: D. G. Higman generalized a coherent configuration and defined a weight. In this article, we will modify the definition and investigate weights on coherent configurations. If our weights are on a thin homogeneous coherent configuration, that is essentially a finite group, then there is a natural correspondence between the set of equivalence classes of weights and $2$-cohomology group of the group. We also give a construction of weights as a generalization of Higman's method using monomial representations of finite groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the canonical double cover of any connected nonbipartite graph have an automorphism group of the form $H \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, where $H$ is the set of automorphism which preserve bipartite parts. We construct connected nonbipartite and vertex determining graphs whose canonical double covers have auromorphisms group isomorphic to any semisimple product of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ with any abstract group $H$. Later we show, that the canonical double cover of any asymmetric graph have abelian automorphisms group of odd order. The above construction provides an example of asymmetric graph for any such group. By modifying the aforementioned construction we obtain graphs which have any possible number and type of graphs with isomorphic double covers.</description>

      <title>On the structure and diameter of graph associahedra of graphs with a set of true twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the graph associahedron $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is a polytope whose 1-skeleton is the rotation graph of $G$, that is, the 1-skeleton of $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is the graph $\mathcal{R}(G)$ whose vertices are the search trees on $G$ and whose edges correspond to an application of a local operation on the search trees, called rotation. The rotation distance between two search trees on $G$ is the minimum number of rotations needed to transform one of the trees into the other. A challenging question is what is the maximum rotation distance between search trees on a graph, i.e. what is the combinatorial diameter of the corresponding graph associahedron. In this paper we study the relation between the structure of $\mathcal{R}(G)$ and $\mathcal{R}(G-S)$ for a particular choice of $S\subseteq E(G)$. More specifically, we show that if $W$ is a set of true twins in $G$ and $S$ is the set of edges in $G$ with both endpoints in $W$, then $\mathcal{R}(G-S)$ is a quotient graph of $\mathcal{R}(G)$. We also give a lower bound for $\text{diam} (\mathcal{R}(G-S))$ in terms of $\text{diam}(\mathcal{R}(G))$. As a consequence, we obtain a new lower bound for the diameter of the graph associahedra of balanced complete bipartite graphs that allow us to compute the exact value of $\text{diam}(\mathcal{R}(K_{2,q}))$ for $q\in\{3,4,5,6,7,8\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $B$-tree is a type of search tree where every node (except possibly for the root) contains between $m$ and $2m$ keys for some positive integer $m$, and all leaves have the same distance to the root. We study sequences of $B$-trees that can arise from successively inserting keys, and in particular present a bijection between such sequences (which we call histories) and a special type of increasing trees. We describe the set of permutations for the keys that belong to a given history, and also show how to use this bijection to analyse statistics associated with $B$-trees.</description>

As a continuation of the work of Shareshian-Wachs (Adv. Math., 225(6) (2010), 2921--2966), we provide a curious $t$-symmetric decomposition for the generating polynomial of the joint distribution of the descent and excedance statistics over the symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Random matchings in linear hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given hypergraph $H$ and a vertex $v\in V(H)$, consider a random matching $M$ chosen uniformly from the set of all matchings in $H.$ In $1995,$ Kahn conjectured that if $H$ is a $d$-regular linear $k$-uniform hypergraph, the probability that $M$ does not cover $v$ is $(1 + o_d(1))d^{-1/k}$ for all vertices $v\in V(H).$ This conjecture was proved for $k = 2$ by Kahn and Kim in $1998.$
  In this paper, we disprove this conjecture for all $k \geq 3.$ For infinitely many values of $d,$ we construct $d$-regular linear $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ containing two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ such that $\mathcal{P}(v_1 \notin M) = 1 - \frac{(1 + o_d(1))}{d^{k-2}}$ and $\mathcal{P}(v_2 \notin M) = \frac{(1 + o_d(1))}{d+1}.$ The gap between $\mathcal{P}(v_1 \notin M)$ and $\mathcal{P}(v_2 \notin M)$ in this $H$ is best possible. In the course of proving this, we also prove a hypergraph analog of Godsil's result on matching polynomials and paths in graphs, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>New bounds on a generalization of Tuza's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, let $\nu^{(m)}(H)$ denote the maximum size of a set $S$ of edges of $H$ whose pairwise intersection has size less than $m$. Let $\tau^{(m)}(H)$ denote the minimum size of a set $S$ of $m$-sets of $V(H)$ such that every edge of $H$ contains some $m$-set from $S$. A conjecture by Aharoni and Zerbib, which generalizes a conjecture of Tuza on the size of minimum edge covers of triangles of a graph, states that for a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, $\tau^{(k - 1)}(H)/\nu^{(k - 1)}(H) \leq \left \lceil \frac{k + 1}{2} \right \rceil$. In this paper, we show that this generalization of Tuza's conjecture holds when $\nu^{(k - 1)}(H) \leq 3$. As a corollary, we obtain a graph class which satisfies Tuza's conjecture. We also prove various bounds on $\tau^{(m)}(H)/\nu^{(m)}(H)$ for other values of $m$ as well as some bounds on the fractional analogues of these numbers.</description>

Abstract: The critical exponent of an infinite word $\bf x$ is the supremum, over all finite nonempty factors $f$, of the exponent of $f$. In this note we show that for all integers $k\geq 2,$ there is a binary infinite $k$-automatic sequence with critical exponent $\leq 7/3$. The same conclusion holds for Fibonacci-automatic and Tribonacci-automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approach to Black-Box Binary Optimization with Budget Constraints: Application to Sensor Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully probabilistic approach for solving binary optimization problems with black-box objective functions and with budget constraints. In the probabilistic approach, the optimization variable is viewed as a random variable and is associated with a parametric probability distribution. The original optimization problem is replaced with an optimization over the expected value of the original objective, which is then optimized over the probability distribution parameters. The resulting optimal parameter (optimal policy) is used to sample the binary space to produce estimates of the optimal solution(s) of the original binary optimization problem. The probability distribution is chosen from the family of Bernoulli models because the optimization variable is binary. The optimization constraints generally restrict the feasibility region. This can be achieved by modeling the random variable with a conditional distribution given satisfiability of the constraints. Thus, in this work we develop conditional Bernoulli distributions to model the random variable conditioned by the total number of nonzero entries, that is, the budget constraint. This approach (a) is generally applicable to binary optimization problems with nonstochastic black-box objective functions and budget constraints; (b) accounts for budget constraints by employing conditional probabilities that sample only the feasible region and thus considerably reduces the computational cost compared with employing soft constraints; and (c) does not employ soft constraints and thus does not require tuning of a regularization parameter, for example to promote sparsity, which is challenging in sensor placement optimization problems. The proposed approach is verified numerically by using an idealized bilinear binary optimization problem and is validated by using a sensor placement experiment in a parameter identification setup.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for contractads and modular compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contractads are operadic-type algebraic structures well-suited for describing configuration spaces indexed by a simple connected graph $\Gamma$. Specifically, these configuration spaces are defined as $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X):=X^{|V(\Gamma)|}\setminus \cup_{(ij)\in E(\Gamma)} {x_i=x_j}$. In this paper, we explore functional equations for the Hilbert series of Koszul dual contractads and provide explicit Hilbert series for fundamental contractads such as the commutative, Lie, associative and the little discs contractads.
  Additionally, we focus on a particular contractad derived from the wonderful compactifications of $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{k})$, for $\mathbb{k}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$. First, we demonstrate that for complete multipartite graphs, the associated wonderful compactifications coincide with the modular compactifications introduced by Smyth. Second, we establish that the homology of the complex points and the homology of the real locus of the wonderful contractad are both quadratic and Koszul contractads. We offer a detailed description of generators and relations, extending the concepts of the Hypercommutative operad and cacti operads, respectively.
  Furthermore, using the functional equations for the Hilbert series, we describe the corresponding Hilbert series for the homology of modular compactifications.
  We hope this work will highlight the concept of contractads and their applications in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ideal $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ is said to be of {\emph{linear type}} when its Rees algebra and symmetric algebra exhibit isomorphism. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture put forth by Jayanthan, Kumar, and Sarkar (2021) that if $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph, then the binomial edge ideal of $G$ is of linear type. Our investigation validates this conjecture for trees. However, our study reveals that not all unicyclic graphs adhere to this conjecture. Furthermore, we provide an explicit description of the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of binomial edge ideals of trees and demonstrate that these algebras are Cohen-Macaulay. Finally, we conclude the equality between symbolic powers and ordinary powers of binomial edge ideals of trees.</description>

      <title>How large is the character degree sum compared to the character table sum for a finite group?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1961, Solomon gave upper and lower bounds for the sum of all the entries in the character table of a finite group in terms of elementary properties of the group. In a different direction, we consider the ratio of the character table sum to the sum of the entries in the first column, also known as the character degree sum, in this work. First, we propose that this ratio is at most two for many natural groups. Secondly, we extend a conjecture of Fields to postulate that this ratio is at least one with equality if and only if the group is abelian. We establish the validity of this property and conjecture for all finite irreducible Coxeter groups. In addition, we prove the conjecture for generalized symmetric groups. The main tool we use is that the sum of a column in the character table of an irreducible Coxeter group (resp. generalized symmetric group) is given by the number of square roots (resp. absolute square roots) of the corresponding conjugacy class representative.
  As a byproduct of our results, we show that the asymptotics of character table sums is the same as the number of involutions in symmetric, hyperoctahedral and demihyperoctahedral groups. We also derive explicit generating functions for the character table sums for these latter groups as infinite products of continued fractions. In the same spirit, we prove similar generating function formulas for the number of square roots and absolute square roots in $n$ for the generalized symmetric groups $G(r,1,n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many mutually non-attacking queens can be placed on a d-dimensional chessboard of size n? The n-queens problem in higher dimensions is a generalization of the well-known n-queens problem. We provide a comprehensive overview of theoretical results, bounds, solution methods, and the interconnectivity of the problem within topics of discrete optimization and combinatorics. We present an integer programming formulation of the n-queens problem in higher dimensions and several strengthenings through additional valid inequalities. Compared to recent benchmarks, we achieve a speedup in computational time between 15-70x over all instances of the integer programs. Our computational results prove optimality of certificates for several large instances. Breaking additional, previously unsolved instances with the proposed methods is likely possible. On the primal side, we further discuss heuristic approaches to constructing solutions that turn out to be optimal when compared to the IP. We conclude with preliminary results on the number and density of the solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of braid graphs in simply-laced Coxeter systems. We prove that every reduced expression has a unique factorization as a product of so-called links, which in turn induces a decomposition of the braid graph into a box product of the braid graphs for each link factor. When the Coxeter graph has no three-cycles, we use the decomposition to prove that braid graphs are partial cubes, i.e., can be isometrically embedded into a hypercube. For a special class of links, called Fibonacci links, we prove that the corresponding braid graphs are Fibonacci cubes.</description>

      <title>The interval posets of permutations seen from the decomposition tree perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10000v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interval poset of a permutation is the set of intervals of a permutation, ordered with respect to inclusion. It has been introduced and studied recently in [B. Tenner, arXiv:2007.06142]. We study this poset from the perspective of the decomposition trees of permutations, describing a procedure to obtain the former from the latter. We then give alternative proofs of some of the results in [B. Tenner, arXiv:2007.06142], and we solve the open problems that it posed (and some other enumerative problems) using techniques from symbolic and analytic combinatorics. Finally, we compute the M\"obius function on such posets.</description>

      <title>Growth rates of the bipartite Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two graphs $G, H$ and a positive integer $q$, an $(H,q)$-coloring of $G$ is an edge-coloring of $G$ such that every copy of $H$ in $G$ receives at least $q$ distinct colors. The bipartite Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s function $r(K_{n,n}, K_{s,t}, q)$ is defined to be the minimum number of colors needed for $K_{n,n}$ to have a $(K_{s,t}, q)$-coloring. For balanced complete bipartite graphs $K_{p,p}$, the function $r(K_{n,n}, K_{p,p}, q)$ was studied systematically in [Axenovich, F\"{u}redi and Mubayi, {\it J. Combin. Theory Ser. B} {\bf 79} (2000), 66--86]. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of this function for complete bipartite graphs $K_{s,t}$ that are not necessarily balanced. Our main results deal with thresholds and lower and upper bounds for the growth rate of this function, in particular for (sub)linear and (sub)quadratic growth. We also obtain new lower bounds for the balanced bipartite case, and improve several results given by Axenovich, F\"{u}redi and Mubayi. Our proof techniques are based on an extension to bipartite graphs of the recently developed Color Energy Method by Pohoata and Sheffer and its refinements, and a generalization of an old result due to Corr\'{a}di.</description>

      <title>On the size and structure of $t$-representable sumsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ be a finite set with minimum element $0$, maximum element $m$, and $\ell$ elements strictly in between. Write $(hA)^{(t)}$ for the set of integers that can be written in at least $t$ ways as a sum of $h$ elements of $A$. We prove that $(hA)^{(t)}$ is "structured" for
  \[ h \geq (1+o(1)) \frac{1}{e} m\ell t^{1/\ell} \]
  (as $\ell \to \infty$, $t^{1/\ell} \to \infty$), and prove a similar theorem on the size and structure of $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ for $h$ sufficiently large. Moreover, we construct a family of sets $A = A(m,\ell,t)\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ for which $(hA)^{(t)}$ is not structured for $h\ll m\ell t^{1/\ell}$.</description>

      <title>Local dimer dynamics in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider local dynamics of the dimer model (perfect matchings) on hypercubic boxes $[n]^d$. These consist of successively switching the dimers along alternating cycles of prescribed (small) lengths. We study the connectivity properties of the dimer configuration space equipped with these transitions. Answering a question of Freire, Klivans, Milet and Saldanha, we show that in three dimensions any configuration admits an alternating cycle of length at most 6. We further establish that any configuration on $[n]^d$ features order $n^{d-2}$ alternating cycles of length at most $4d-2$. We also prove that the dynamics of dimer configurations on the unit hypercube of dimension $d$ is ergodic when switching alternating cycles of length at most $4d-4$. Finally, in the planar but non-bipartite case, we show that parallelogram-shaped boxes in the triangular lattice are ergodic for switching alternating cycles of lengths 4 and 6 only, thus improving a result of Kenyon and R\'emila, which also uses 8-cycles. None of our proofs make reference to height functions.</description>

      <title>Hamilton transversals in tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that every tournament contains a Hamilton path, and every strongly connected tournament contains a Hamilton cycle. This paper establishes transversal generalizations of these classical results. For a collection $\mathbf{T}=\{T_1,\dots,T_m\}$ of not-necessarily distinct tournaments on a common vertex set $V$, an $m$-edge directed graph $\mathcal{D}$ with vertices in $V$ is called a $\mathbf{T}$-transversal if there exists a bijection $\phi\colon E(\mathcal{D})\to [m]$ such that $e\in E(T_{\phi(e)})$ for all $e\in E(\mathcal{D})$. We prove that for sufficiently large $m$ with $m=|V|-1$, there exists a $\mathbf{T}$-transversal Hamilton path. Moreover, if $m=|V|$ and at least $m-1$ of the tournaments $T_1,\ldots,T_m$ are assumed to be strongly connected, then there is a $\mathbf{T}$-transversal Hamilton cycle. In our proof, we utilize a novel way of partitioning tournaments which we dub $\mathbf{H}$-partition.</description>

Moreover, We extend the conclusions of Haemers et al. to a broader context.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture of Jackson from 1981 states that every $d$-regular oriented graph on $n$ vertices with $n\leq 4d+1$ is Hamiltonian. We prove this conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. In fact we prove a more general result that for all $\alpha&gt;0$, there exists $n_0=n_0(\alpha)$ such that every $d$-regular digraph on $n\geq n_0$ vertices with $d \geq \alpha n $ can be covered by at most $n/(d+1)$ vertex-disjoint cycles, and moreover that if $G$ is an oriented graph, then at most $n/(2d+1)$ cycles suffice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H os, Lov\'asz and Spencer showed in the late 1970s that the dimension of the region of $k$-vertex graph profiles, i.e., the region of feasible densities of $k$-vertex graphs in large graphs, is equal to the number of non-trivial connected graphs with at most $k$ vertices. We determine the dimension of the region of $k$-vertex tournament profiles. Our result, which explores an interesting connection to Lyndon words, yields that the dimension is much larger than just the number of strongly connected tournaments, which would be the answer expected as the analogy to the setting of graphs.</description>

      <title>Paired coalition in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \noindent A paired coalition in a graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a paired dominating set but whose union $V_1 \cup V_2$ is a paired dominating set. A paired coalition partition (abbreviated $pc$-partition) in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi= \lbrace V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k \rbrace$ such that each set $V_i$ of $\pi$ is not a paired dominating set but forms a paired coalition with another set $V_j \in \pi$. The paired coalition graph $PCG(G,\pi) $ of the graph $G$ and the $pc$-partition $\pi$ of $G$, is the graph whose vertices correspond one-to-one with the sets of $\pi$, and two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent in $PCG(G,\pi) $ if and only if their corresponding sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ form a paired coalition in $G$. In this paper, we initiate the study of paired coalition partitions and paired coalition graphs. In particular, we determine the paired coalition number of paths and cycles, obtain some results on paired coalition partitions in trees and characterize pair coalition graphs of paths, cycles and trees. We also characterize triangle-free graphs $G$ with $PC(G)=n$ and unicyclic graphs $G$ with $PC(G)=n-2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $p\leq 23$ be a prime and $a_p(n)$ counts the number of partitions of $n$ where parts that are multiple of $p$ come up with $2$ colors. Using a result of Sussman, we derive the exact formula for $a_p(n)$ and obtain an asymptotic formula for $\log a_p(n)$. Our results partially extend the work of Mauth, who proved the asymptotic formula for $\log a_2(n)$ conjectured by Banerjee et al.</description>

      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $A_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $N=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $A_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $A_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $A_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>The largest subgraph without a forbidden induced subgraph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the systematic study of the following Tur\'an-type question. Suppose $\Gamma$ is a graph with $n$ vertices such that the edge density between any pair of subsets of vertices of size at least $t$ is at most $1 - c$, for some $t$ and $c &gt; 0$. What is the largest number of edges in a subgraph $G \subseteq \Gamma$ which does not contain a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph or, more generally, which belongs to a hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$? This provides a common generalization of two recently studied cases, namely $\Gamma$ being a (pseudo-)random graph and a graph without a large complete bipartite subgraph. We focus on the interesting case where $H$ is a bipartite graph.
  We determine the answer up to a constant factor with respect to $n$ and $t$, for certain bipartite $H$ and for $\Gamma$ either a dense random graph or a Paley graph with a square number of vertices. In particular, our bounds match if $H$ is a tree, or if one part of $H$ has $d$ vertices complete to the other part, all other vertices in that part have degree at most $d$, and the other part has sufficiently many vertices. As applications of the latter result, we answer a question of Alon, Krivelevich, and Samotij on the largest subgraph with a hereditary property which misses a bipartite graph, and determine up to a constant factor the largest number of edges in a string subgraph of $\Gamma$. The proofs are based on a variant of the dependent random choice and a novel approach for finding induced copies by inductively defining probability distributions supported on induced copies of smaller subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Partitioning the set of natural numbers into Mersenne trees and into arithmetic progressions; Natural Matrix and Linnik's constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We partition a series of natural numbers into infinite number sequences. We consider two partitioning options: (a) a forest of unary trees with recurrence formula of Mersenne numbers, and (b) a set of arithmetic progressions with difference $2^k$. Every tree starts with an even number, and any even number starts a certain tree. In the partitioning into arithmetic progressions, each progression starts with a Mersenne number, and each Mersenne number is the beginning of a particular arithmetic progression. Unary trees starting from some term are contained in OEIS A036991 (compact Dyck path codes), so we consider A036991 as a backbone of the partitions. In particular, we prove the existence of an arithmetic progression of any length in A036991. As a result of the partitions, we obtain a Natural Matrix with a packing function that captures the bijection between the set of natural numbers and the set of ordered pairs of natural numbers. In Natural Matrix, the even natural numbers are located on the $x$-axis, so the selection of primes in the considered arithmetic progressions is greatly simplified. A method for proving the infinity of primes in A036991 is proposed. In this regard, an attempt is made to reduce the Linnik's constant to $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two restriction maps of the logarithmic modules of plane arrangements in a three dimensional vector space. One is the Euler restriction and the other is the Ziegler restriction. The dimension of the cokernel of the Ziegler restriction map of logarithmic derivation modules has been well-studied for the freeness of hyperplane arrangements after Yoshinaga's celebrated criterion for freeness, which connects the second Betti number and the splitting type (exponents). However, though the Euler restriction has a longer history than the Ziegler restriction, the cokernel and its dimension of the Euler restriction have not been studied at all.
  The aim of this article is to study the cokernel and dimension of the Euler restriction maps in terms of combinatorics, more explicitly, the characteristic polynomial. We give an upper bound of that cokernel, and show the formula for that if the arrangement is free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Stirling polynomials, Gessel and Stanley introduced the definition of Stirling permutation, which has attracted extensive attention over the past decades. Recently, we introduced Stirling permutation code and provided numerous equidistribution results as applications. The purpose of the present work is to further analyse Stirling permutation code. First, we derive an expansion formula expressing the joint distribution of the types $A$ and $B$ descent statistics over the hyperoctahedral group, and we also find an interlacing property involving the zeros of its coefficient polynomials. Next, we prove a strong connection between signed permutations in the hyperoctahedral group and Stirling permutations. Furthermore, we investigate unified generalizations of the trivariate second-order Eulerian polynomials and ascent-plateau polynomials. Using Stirling permutation codes, we provide expansion formulas for eight-variable and seventeen-variable polynomials, which imply several $e$-positive expansions and clarify the connections among several statistics. Our results generalize the results of B\'ona, Chen-Fu, Dumont, Janson, Haglund-Visontai and Petersen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $B$ of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is referred to as a $\ell$-covering set if $\{ ab \pmod n | 0\leq a \leq \ell, b\in B\} = \mathbb{Z}_n$. We show that there exists a $\ell$-covering set of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ of size $O(\frac{n}{\ell}\log n)$ for all $n$ and $\ell$, and how to construct such a set. We also provide examples where any $\ell$-covering set must have a size of $\Omega(\frac{n}{\ell}\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. The proof employs a refined bound for the relative totient function obtained through sieve theory and the existence of a large divisor with a linear divisor sum. The result can be used to simplify a modular subset sum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Macaulay Posets and Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macaulay posets are posets in which an analog of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem holds. Macaulay rings (also called Macaulay-Lex rings) are rings in which an analog of Macaulay's Theorem for lex ideals holds. The study of both of these objects started with Macaulay almost a century ago. Since then, these two branches have developed separately over the past century, with the last link being the Clements-Lindstr\"om Theorem.
  For every ring that is the quotient of a polynomial ring by a homogeneous ideal we define the poset of monomials. Under certain conditions, we prove a Macaulay Correspondence Theorem, a ring is Macaulay if and only if its poset of monomials is Macaulay. Furthermore, the tensor product of rings corresponds to the Cartesian product of the posets of monomials. This allows us to transfer results between rings and posets. By using this translation, we give several answers to a problem posed by Mermin and Peeva, a positive answer to Hoefel's question about applying Macaulay poset theory to ring theory, and deduce several other results in algebra and combinatorics.
  A new proof of the Mermin-Murai Theorem on colored square free rings is presented by using star posets. We extend the Mermin-Murai Theorem to rings that are not square free. Using a result from Mermin and Peeva we give an answer to a question posed by Bezrukov and Leck. Some results of Chong also give answers to the Bezrukov-Leck problem. All of these results have a common feature. They involve the tensor product of rings whose Hasse graphs of the poset of monomials are trees. We call such rings, tree rings. We give a classification of Macaulay rings that are the tensor product of a tree ring. Finally, we show that there are Macaulay rings that are not the tensor product of tree rings, and present the first examples of Macaulay rings that are not quotients by a monomial ideal and not quotients by a toric ideal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13864v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new tools for the construction of fixed point sets in digital topology. We define excludable points and show that these may be excluded from all freezing sets. We show that articulation points are excludable.
  We also present results concerning points that must belong to a freezing set and often are easily recognized. These include points of degree~1 and some local extrema.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>

      <title>Homology of matching complexes and representations of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the homology of the matching complex $M(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the complete hypergraph on $n\geq 2$ vertices, and analyse the $S_n$-representations carried by this homology. These results are achieved using standard techniques in combinatorial topology, such as the theory of shellings. We then broaden the scope to the larger class of fibre-closed families of simplicial complexes and consider these through the lens of representation stability. This allows us to prove a number of results of an asymptotic nature, such as an analysis of the growth of Betti numbers and the kinds of irreducible $S_n$-representations that appear.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial view of Holant problems on higher domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the Boolean domain, there is a class of symmetric signatures called ``Fibonacci gates'' for which a beautiful P-time combinatorial algorithm has been designed for the corresponding $\operatorname{Holant}$ problems.
  In this work, I give a combinatorial view for $\operatorname{Holant}(\mathcal{F})$ problems on a domain of size 3 where $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of arity 3 functions with inputs taking values on the domain of size 3 and the functions share some common properties. The combinatorial view can also be extended to the domain of size 4.
  Specifically, I extend the definition of "Fibonacci gates" to the domain of size 3 and the domain of size 4. Moreover, I give the corresponding combinatorial algorithms.</description>
