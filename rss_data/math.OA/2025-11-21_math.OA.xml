      <title>On the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras in continuous model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical model theory, the Keisler-Shelah theorem establishes a fundamental connection between the elementary equivalence of structures and the isomorphism of their ultrapowers. Motivated by this, one may ask whether an analogous relationship holds in the framework of continuous model theory, which naturally encompasses metric structures such as $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. In this paper, we investigate the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of operator algebras from a model-theoretic perspective. We prove that, assuming the negation of the continuum hypothesis, there exist two elementarily equivalent infinite-dimensional unital $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras $A$ and $B$ of size $\le \mathfrak c$ such that for all non-principal ultrafilters $\mathcal U, \mathcal V$ on $\omega$, the ultrapowers $A^{\mathcal U}$ and $B^{\mathcal V}$ are not isomorphic. This result provides a continuous analogue of certain classical theorems concerning ultraproducts and demonstrates that the model-theoretic behavior of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras is closely related to set-theoretic principles such as the continuum hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Emulation Capacity between Idempotent Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal rates of emulation (also called interconversion) between quantum channels. When the source and the target channels are idempotent, we give a single-letter expression for the zero-error emulation capacity in terms of structural properties of the range of the two channels. This expression shows that channel emulation is not reversible for general idempotent channels. Furthermore, we establish a strong converse rate that matches with the zero-error emulation capacity when the source or the target channel is either an identity or a completely dephasing channel.</description>

      <title>An extreme boundary of acylindrically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every acylindrically hyperbolic group admits a minimal and extremely proximal action on a compact metrizable space. If there are no nontrivial finite normal subgroups, then the action is topologically free. This answers positively a question of Ozawa and the applications to $C^\ast$-algebras are discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric property (T) for box spaces and sofic approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every sofic approximation of a property (T) group is approximately isomorphic to one having geometric property (T), and more generally, a box space of graphs which has boundary geometric property (T) is approximately isomorphic to one having geometric property (T). We also prove that a sequence of bounded degree graphs is approximately isomorphic to a disjoint union of expanders if and only if the Laplacian has spectral gap in the ultraproduct. Finally, we prove a local geometric criterion for geometric property (T) in the spirit of \.{Z}uk's criterion for property (T) for groups.</description>

      <title>Twisted operator algebras of self-similar groupoid actions on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study self-similar groupoid actions on arbitrary directed graphs together with $\mathbb{T}$-valued twists that exhaust the second cohomology group of the associated Zappa-Sz\'ep product category. We define and analyse the associated universal, reduced, and essential $C^*$-algebras, along with their Toeplitz versions and core subalgebras. In fact, we develop our theory in the more general setting of $L^P$-operator algebras, where $P\subseteq [1,\infty]$ is any non-empty set of parameters. This includes $C^*$-algebras, $L^p$-operator algebras and symmetrised $L^{p,*}$-operator algebras for $p\in [1,\infty]$, as special cases.
  We use three complementary approaches: twisted inverse semigroups, twisted ample groupoids, and $C^*$-correspondences. We provide, in terms of the self-similar action, general characterisations of topological freeness, minimality, Hausdorffness, finite non-Hausdorffness, effectiveness, and local contractiveness for the associated ample groupoids. We generalise the classical Cuntz--Krieger Uniqueness and Coburn--Toeplitz Uniqueness Theorems for graph $C^*$-algebras to twisted $L^P$-operator algebras of self-similar groupoid actions. We characterise when the natural inclusions are Cartan, give checkable criteria for simplicity and pure infiniteness of the essential algebras, and discuss when the universal and reduced algebras coincide.
  We also provide conditions that ensure the singular ideals vanish. Using the groupoid model we show that for any $P\subseteq [1,\infty]$, the $L^P$-operator algebra of a contracting self-similar action is simple if and only if the corresponding Steinberg algebra is simple. Using the Toeplitz-Pimsner model, we prove that for the universal groupoid of any self-similar groupoid action on a row-finite graph, the singular $C^*$-algebraic ideal always vanishes.</description>
