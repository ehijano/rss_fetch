      <title>Elastic rigid rod in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of a rigid elastic rod, initially set in its relaxed state along a spacelike geodesic, in an expanding Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. This leads to an initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for a nonlinear wave equation whose nonlinearity depends on a parameter $\kappa \geq 0$, related to the ratio between the rod's length and the cosmological scale. We show that if $\kappa$ is small enough then the solution to the IBVP is global in time and bounded, meaning that the rod's length oscillates around its initial value. For greater values of $\kappa$, however, the solution to the IBVP blows up in finite coordinate time, indicating that the rod is infinitely stretched by the cosmological expansion. This supports the widely held belief that sufficiently small bound systems do not follow the Hubble flow, whereas larger systems may do so. Similar conclusions apply to the tethered galaxy version of this problem, where the rod is used to connect two point masses (which results in nonlinear boundary conditions for the IBVP).</description>

      <title>Conical singularity in spacetimes with NUT is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the issue of defining and measuring conical deficits (conicity) in spacetimes with the torsion singularity such as the Misner string in Taub--NUT spacetime. We propose a geometric definition that generalizes the standard notion of conicity to stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with torsion singularity, where the conical deficit becomes observer-dependent -- it depends on the choice of a timelike Killing vector. This implies the existence of observers who perceive no conical singularity along the symmetry axis. As a result, in any spacetime with a non-vanishing NUT parameter, there are observers for whom the conicity has the same value on both semi-axes. This challenges the usual interpretation of conicity differences as indicators of string/rod-induced acceleration along the axis. We illustrate our definition across the full Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class, including the recently identified accelerated Taub--NUT solution. Our attempts in determining a canonical observer lead to even less desirable definitions of conicity.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic cosmology using observational datasets: exploring via machine learning approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current study, we present the observational data constraints on the parameters space for an anisotropic cosmological model of Bianchi I type spacetime in general relativity (GR). For the analysis, we consider observational datasets of Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) peak parameters. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is utilized to constrain the bestfit values of the model parameters. For this purpose, we use the publicly available Python code from CosmoMC and have developed the contour plots with different constraint limits. For the joint dataset of CC, BAO, and CMBR, the parameter's best-fit values for the derived model are estimated as H_0 = 69.9\pm 1.4 km/s/Mpc, \Omega_{m0}=0.277^{+0.017}_{-0.015}, \Omega_{\Lambda 0} = 0.722^{+0.015}_{-0.017}, and \Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.0009\pm0.0001. To estimate H(z), we explore machine learning (ML) techniques like linear regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and polynomial regression and thereafter analyze the results with the theoretically developed H(z) for the proposed model. Among these ML techniques, the polynomial regression exceeds the performance compared to other techniques. Further, we also note that larger dataset provides a better understanding of the cosmological scenario in terms of ML view point.</description>

      <title>Classification of $\Lambda \neq 0$-vacuum algebraically special spacetimes with conformally flat $\mathscr I$ from Weyl tensor expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general algebraic decomposition of Riemann-like and Weyl-like tensors with respect to a non-null vector $u$. We derive Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci-type identities for the Weyl tensor, that allow to relate the components of the spacetime Weyl tensor with intrinsic quantities of the hypersurfaces orthogonal to $u$.
  Restricting to the case of $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes (with $\Lambda \neq 0$ and any dimension) admiting a conformal compactification, we then study the behaviour of the Weyl tensor near $\mathscr I$ by means of an asymptotic expansion {\it \`a la} Fefferman-Graham, where the first terms are explicitly computed. We use these tools to characterize four dimensional algebraically special spacetimes with locally conformally flat $\mathscr{I}$, showing they match exactly the so-called {\it Kerr-de Sitter-like class with conformally flat $\scri$}, thus providing a geometric characterization of this class of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Testing modified gravity with the eccentric neutron star--black hole merger GW200105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detections of gravitational waves offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the highly dynamical and strong field regime. Current tests are typically performed assuming signals from quasi-circular binaries. However, the complex waveform morphology induced by orbital eccentricity can enhance our ability to probe gravity with greater precision. A recent analysis of the neutron star-black hole event GW200105 identified strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. We extend an eccentric-precessing waveform model to test alternative models with this signal by incorporating eccentric corrections induced by Brans-Dicke, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet, and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity at leading post-Newtonian order. We show that analyzing this event with a quasi-circular model leads to a false deviation from general relativity, while the inclusion of eccentricity improves the bounds on the models. Our analysis of GW200105 places tight constraints on Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, $\alpha^{1/2}_{\text{EdGB}} \lesssim 2.38\,\text{km}$, and Brans-Dicke gravity, $\omega_{\text{BD}} \gtrsim 3.5$, while dynamical Chern-Simons gravity remains unconstrained due to the low spin content.</description>

      <title>Echoes of bimodal axial gravitational perturbations in a uniform-density star in Einstein-{\AE}ther gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of a uniform-density star in scalar-Einstein-{\AE}ther theory. By applying the Israel junction conditions explicitly in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to the gravitational sector, it is shown that a nontrivial scalar profile cannot be sustained, as it induces a divergence at the stellar center. Since analytical solutions are unattainable, the background metric is determined through numerical integration for a few representative configurations. For axial gravitational perturbations, it is found that the system of equations of motion cannot be decoupled as long as the {\AE}ther parameter $c_i$ does not vanish. Subsequently, the dynamics of the system can be simplified to two coupled equations that describe vector and tensor perturbations with distinct wave velocities $c_V$ and $c_T$, giving rise to a bimodal system. It is shown that as the stellar radius is smaller than that of the maximum of the vacuum Schwarzschild-type effective potential, a potential well is formed, leading to the emergence of echo phenomenon for the axial gravitational perturbations. When the stellar radius exceeds the {\it could-have-been} maximum, the resulting effective potential decreases monotonically, and the wave propagation is primarily dictated by the discontinuity occurring at the star's surface, producing a type of more attenuated echo waves. In addition, we explore the specific properties of the resultant bimodal medium consisting of two degrees of freedom with distinct sound speeds. However, it is understood that such a characteristic does not lead to observational implications, and subsequently hardly offers a potential empirical means to constrain specific metric parameters of the Einstein-{\AE}ther. We present numerical calculations and discuss the potential implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Merger History of Primordial Black Holes from Gravitational-Wave data and the Stochastic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are well-motivated candidates for cold dark matter and may also account for a fraction of the binary black hole mergers observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. In this study, we investigate the gravitational-wave signatures of PBHs, with a particular focus on evaluating their integrated contribution to the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from binary mergers over a broad range of redshifts. We perform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass function. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting for gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we employ the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Owing to their primordial origin, PBHs exhibit enhanced merger activity at high redshifts, prior to the onset of stellar formation. Our analysis yields a relatively weak inference on the redshift evolution index of the PBH merger rate, with $\alpha = 2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ at 68\% confidence level. The local merger rate of PBH binaries is found with posterior estimates lying in the range $23.5-30.3~\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, reflecting a high degree of statistical precision in the inferred distribution. Additionally, we emphasize the potential of stochastic gravitational-wave background observations to probe the cumulative history of PBH mergers across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Planckian charged black holes and their cosmological ramifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear electrodynamics at high energy scales has led to a variety of interesting phenomena in recent years, particularly within the context of non-singular spacetime geometries. Additionally, it is postulated that gravity near the Planck scale is governed by a minimal cut-off length, which acts as a renormalization scale against ultraviolet pathologies. Within this framework, we combine both concepts by introducing modifications to the electric and matter sectors of a black hole as its size approaches this minimal length. The result is an electrically charged black hole that is free from ultraviolet divergences and recovers the Maxwell limit at classical scales. We further explore the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the resulting solution within a cosmological anti-de Sitter background, revealing a chemical analogy with that of a Van der Waals fluid. Subsequently, we examine the charged black hole in de Sitter space and construct four corresponding gravitational instantons. We then study their cosmological quantum production using the formalism of the pair creation rate within the context of the no-boundary proposal.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Constraints in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ Gravity: A Vielbein Approach in Weitzenb\"{o}ck Spacetime with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore dark matter phenomenology in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ gravity, formulated via the vielbein approach in Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime. In this torsion-based extension of gravity, dark matter emerges as a geometric effect rather than a particle species, with curvature and torsion contributing dynamically to the field equations. Using recent data -- including SPARC galaxy rotation curves, Planck CMB observations, and weak lensing from DES and KiDS -- we constrain the model through MCMC analysis. Our results show that, under specific parameter choices, the theory replicates key cosmological features without introducing additional dark sector matter. This framework offers a testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, providing new insight into structure formation, gravitational lensing, and cosmic acceleration -- all rooted in the geometry of spacetime.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of time on Mars with lunar and terrestrial clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As space exploration extends into cislunar space and further towards Mars, understanding the relativistic effects on clocks on Mars, particularly in relation to multibody gravitational influences, becomes increasingly important for accurate clock synchronization. This study estimates clock rates on Mars and compares them to those on the Moon and Earth. We find that, on average, clocks on Mars tick faster than those on the Earth's geoid by 477 microseconds per day, with a variation of 226 microseconds per day over a Martian year. Additionally, there is an amplitude modulation of approximately 40 microseconds per day over seven synodic cycles. We also introduce a formalism for addressing the effects of solar tides on the Earth-Moon system for predicting clock rates on the Moon and Mars more accurately when compared to using only Keplerian orbit approximations. Our analysis quantifies the relativistic proper time offsets among Martian, lunar, and terrestrial clocks, highlighting important implications for mission planning and the implementation of timekeeping systems on Mars.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of regular black holes surrounded by skewed dark matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections, allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations: scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases, altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles, revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmological perturbations in the minimal theory of mass-varying massive gravity (MTMVMG), a constrained extension of mass-varying massive gravity that propagates only three physical degrees of freedom. We show that MTMVMG admits a stable cosmological solutions i.e. free from ghost, gradient, and tachyonic instabilities around the homogeneous and isotropic background. We further demonstrate that the dynamical external scalar field$\textendash\textendash$which is responsible for the mass of the graviton$\textendash\textendash$can suitably serve as either dark energy or the inflaton, yielding a description consistent with current cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of R\'enyi Holographic dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational evidences point out towards a late time acceleration of the universe. In order to study the accelerated expansion, scientists have incorporated the existence of an exotic matter with negative pressure, termed as dark energy. Afterwards a new idea of dark energy have been studied depending on the holographic principle of quantum gravity, called as the Holographic Dark Energy(HDE). Later on modifying Bekestein-Hawking entropy, different generalized entropies have been proposed, one of them being R\'enyi entropy which leads to R\'enyi holographic dark energy model (RHDE). We have considered RHDE model with Hubble horizon as the IR cut off and have studied the cosmological behaviour under non interacting, linear and non-linear interacting scenarios with the help of dynamical systems analysis. We have also investigated the stability of the system around hyperbolic critical points along with the type of fluid description, evolution of equation of state parameter as well as matter and energy density parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing missing physics from inspiralling compact binaries via time-frequency tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital evolution of binary black hole (BBH) systems is determined by the component masses and spins of the black holes and the governing gravity theory. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from the evolution of BBH orbits offer an unparalleled opportunity for examining the predictions of General Relativity (GR) and for searching for missing physics in the current waveform models. We present a method of stacking up the time-frequency pixel energies through the orbital frequency evolution with the flexibility of gradually shifting the orbital frequency curve along the frequency axis. We observe a distinct energy peak corresponding to the GW signal's quadrupole mode. If an alternative theory of gravity is considered and the analysis of the BBH orbital evolution is executed following GR, the energy distribution on the time-frequency plane will be significantly different. We propose a new consistency test to check whether our theoretical waveform explains the BBH orbital evolution. Through the numerical simulation of beyond-GR theory of gravity and utilizing the framework of second-generation interferometers, we demonstrate the efficiency of this new method in detecting any possible departure from GR. Finally, when applied to an eccentric BBH system and GW190814, which shows the signatures of higher-order multipoles, our method provides an exquisite probe of missing physics in the GR waveform models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate relativistic Bondi accretion in the Simpson-Visser spacetime, which, via a single parameter $\ell$, interpolates between the Schwarzschild, regular black hole, extremal and wormhole regimes. First, we analyze the neutral Simpson-Visser geometry, recovering Schwarzschild at $\ell=0$, and then its charged extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric. In both these cases, we derive the conservation equations and analyze two representative fluid models: a barotropic perfect fluid and a constituent with an exponential density profile. By varying the parameters across regimes, we locate critical (sonic) points and integrate velocity, density and pressure profiles. While near-horizon inflow velocities are similar across the different solutions, we find that the critical radius and the resulting accretion rates and luminosities severely change, depending on the value of the parameter and type of fluid. Remarkably, the barotropic and exponential cases exhibit different trends in the outer regions. Moreover, by extending the analysis to the charged SV spacetime, we find that the presence of a central charge $Q$ produces additional, albeit modest, shifts in the sonic radius which, in combination with those induced by the regularization parameter $\ell$, could provide a double observational marker. In particular, while $\ell$ acts predominantly on the position of the critical point, in the barotropic fluid case, the electromagnetic contribution of $Q$ slightly dampens the inflow velocity near the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Setting up a relativistic lunar reference frame is of a prime importance in the context of future exploration missions to the Moon. If the procedure for building a consistent reference frame within the framework of the general theory of relativity is well established (cf. resolutions B.3 of IAU 2000), there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be adopted as reference in the cislunar region. In this paper, we review the orders of magnitude of the relativistic effects resulting from (i) the gravitational redshift of a clock on the lunar surface and (ii) the time transformations between a clock on the surface of the Moon and a clock on the surface of the Earth. We then discuss possible options for a lunar reference timescale with their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we propose possible realizations of the lunar reference timescale as well as its traceability to UTC.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals Black Holes: Universality, Quantum Corrections, and Topological Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the universal extremality relation and thermodynamic topology of Van der Waals (VdW) black holes-solutions of Einstein's equations whose thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of Van der Waals fluids. In the classical case, the black hole entropy obeys the Bekenstein-Hawking area law and satisfies the standard universality relation. We then incorporate quantum corrections using three distinct frameworks: the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), and Rainbow Gravity. While these corrections modify the entropy law, we find that a generalized form of the universal extremality relation still holds. Next, we explore the thermodynamic topology of VdW black holes, focusing on the distribution of topological charges. Our analysis reveals that variations in the black hole and model parameters lead to significant changes in topological classifications and stability, as quantified by winding numbers. In the GUP-corrected case, topological charge distributions exhibit robustness against parameter variations, suggesting classification stability. For EUP-corrected black holes, we identify two distinct topological classes, with some configurations displaying three non-zero topological charges and others maintaining a total charge of zero, despite changes in individual charge counts. The Rainbow Gravity-corrected scenario shows similar consistency in topological behavior.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction From the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection under Circular Plasma and Plunging Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a class of exact solutions describing rotating black holes immersed in a uniform magnetic field has been proposed, and various properties of such black holes remain unclear. This paper aims to explore how to extract energy based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism in both the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the properties of this spacetime, we analyze physical quantities such as the size of the ergoregion, the event horizon, and the boundaries of the ergosphere. We then analyze the magnetic reconnection process within circular orbits. We plot energy extraction parameter diagrams, and analyze the power and efficiency of energy extraction. The results show that the magnetic field impedes energy extraction. Comparing with Kerr black holes and Kerr-Melvin black holes, we find that this black hole's energy extraction capability is stronger than that of the Kerr-Melvin black hole but weaker than that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we study magnetic reconnection and energy extraction in the plunging region of this black hole. The results indicate that the magnetic field still impedes energy extraction. The black hole's energy extraction capability in this region also remains weaker than that of a Kerr black hole but stronger than that of a Kerr-Melvin black hole. Comparing the plunging region with the circular orbit region, we find that the energy extraction power in the plunging region is consistently stronger than in the circular orbit region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current models of quantum interference experiments in external gravitational fields lack a common framework: while matter-wave interferometers are commonly described using the Schr\"odinger equation with a Newtonian potential, gravitational effects in quantum optics are modeled using either post-Newtonian metrics or highly symmetric exact solutions to Einstein's field equations such as those of Schwarzschild and Kerr. To coherently describe both kinds of experiments, this paper develops a unified framework for modeling quantum interferometers in general stationary space-times. This model provides a rigorous description and coherent interpretation of the effects of classical gravity on quantum probes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical potential and evolving circular orbits in dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the effective potential method to dynamical spacetimes by introducing a novel concept of dynamical potential and establishing three fundamental conditions that govern the evolution of circular orbits in such spacetimes. By generalizing the framework from static to dynamical spacetimes, we propose three conditions for the evolution equation of circular orbits: (1) The orbital radius of the evolving circular orbits does not explicitly depend on the affine parameter; (2) the dynamical potential does not change along the evolving circular orbits; and (3) the angular momentum of the evolving circular orbits is conserved. The dynamical potential conditions yield evolution equations for circular orbits that are shown to be equivalent to the quasi-local method. This approach provides a unified framework for analyzing orbital dynamics in time-dependent gravitational fields, with direct implications for black hole dynamics. The results bridge traditional effective potential methods with dynamical spacetime studies, enhancing the tools available for probing black hole mergers and evolving relativistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the Newman-Penrose formalism and following the classic Teukolsky-like approach, we linearise the field equations of quadratic gravity on the Kerr background and combine them with the linearised Ricci and Bianch identities. This leads to constraints on linear perturbations of the Kerr spacetime in quadratic gravity. The resulting differential equations are decoupled in such a way that only the Ricci tensor perturbations need to be found on the Kerr background in order to fully determine the solution. The results are illustrated in the simple non-trivial cases of the Schwarzschild and Minkowski geometries.</description>

      <title>Accretion dynamics in black holes with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spherical accretion of various types of fluids onto a Schwarzschild-like black hole solution modified by a Kalb-Ramond field implementing spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation (LV). The system is analyzed for isothermal fluids characterized by the equation of state $p=\omega\rho$, including ultra-stiff, ultra-relativistic, and radiation fluids. We investigate the effect of the LV parameter $l$ on the fluid density $\rho(r)$, radial velocity $u(r)$, and accretion rate $\dot{M}$. Using a Hamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical points and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show that the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow structure, and the accretion rate, with $l&gt;0$ ($l&lt;0$) enhancing (suppressing) the latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow remains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids, transonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on the sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\mathcal{K} \rho^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma=5/3$ and $\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar qualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the equation of state and the LV parameter. These findings suggest that Lorentz symmetry breaking can significantly alter accretion dynamics in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A Partially Massless Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a Higgs mechanism for the partially massless graviton. In order to do so, we first construct a covariant fracton-like effective field theory on de Sitter space that linearly realizes a dipolar shift symmetry. The global symmetry of this theory can be gauged by coupling it to a partially massless spin-2 gauge field. When the fractonic matter condenses, the dipole symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Goldstone mode is a galileon and the partially massless graviton combines with this mode and becomes fully massive. At long distances, the phenomenology of this theory is captured by a quasi-topological field theory and displays many features analogous to those of the superconducting phase in electromagnetism, including gapless edge modes and persistent currents. We also describe the generalization to higher spins.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear causality of Israel-Stewart theory with diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully nonlinear causality constraints in $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions for Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of energy and number diffusion in the Eckart and Landau hydrodynamic frames, respectively. These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime, or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators are important observables in cosmology. They are often approximated by de Sitter space correlators. In this paper, we give a first precise diagrammatical computation of higher loop diagrams to all orders for a conformally coupled scalar in four dimensions. We show that, in contrast to flat space, diagrams of necklace topology do not resum using the natural application of de Sitter-invariant regularization and are thus hard to evaluate. We propose a modification to the UV-regularization of the loops, compatible with de Sitter invariance, but much easier to work with. The modified diagrams can be resummed to give a glimpse at non-perturbative effects for de Sitter correlators. Furthermore, they fit nicely with recently proposed cosmological dressing rules.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. A Color Glass Condensate EFT, and renormalization group equations in this framework, describe wee parton correlations, and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in this framework has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable to gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges. In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>How many pixels are there in a polarized pulsar timing array map?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\'e sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.</description>

      <title>Does DESI DR2 challenge $\Lambda$CDM paradigm ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the debate about the systematic errors of DESI DR1 is still open, recent DESI DR2 is consistent with DESI DR1 and further strengthens the results of DESI DR1. In this analysis, we present a $\sim 2.38 \sigma$ discrepancy between Planck $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology and the DESI DR2 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG1) data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$, which predicts an unexpectedly large value for $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_m = 0.471^{+0.119}_{-0.065}$. We find that the $w_0 w_a$CDM model, using DESI DR2 data, suggests $w_0 &gt; 1$, indicating a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, where is strictly $w_0 = -1$. Additionally, the DESI DR2 data reveals that the value of $\Omega_m$ fluctuates at the 2.97 $\sigma$ level as redshift bin increases, particularly within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The DESI DR2 LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ seem to contradict the results from Type Ia supernovae in the same redshift range. However, it is expected that this discrepancy will become less significant with future DESI data releases, and the trend for $\Omega_m$ is expected to continue to increase as higher redshifts are considered. The statistical significance of this trend was approximately $1.8 \sigma$ when only the DESI DR1 data was considered, but, in the light of DESI DR2 data, the significance has decreased to about $0.52 \sigma$. Despite this reduction, the trend showing an increase in $\Omega_m$ with higher redshifts remains, though with less statistical confidence. This highlights the importance of understanding why the DESI LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ appear to be an outlier in the determination of $\Omega_m$.</description>

      <title>Image of a time-dependent rotating regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a modeling framework based on spatio-temporal generalized random fields to simulate the time-evolving accretion flows and their associated imaging signatures around rotating regular black holes. We extend the Mat\'ern field formalism to the spatio-temporal domain and introduce a locally anisotropic tensor structure \(\Lambda(\mathbf{x})\), which encodes direction-dependent correlation scales motivated by Keplerian velocity fields, thereby generating physically informed perturbation structures. Coupled with a computationally efficient light ray-tracing scheme, this framework produces a sequence of time-resolved images of regular black hole shadow and accretion structures. By incorporating light-travel time effects, we identify significant temporal smearing of features within strongly lensed regions and rapidly varying sources, thus enhancing the physical realism of the modeling. Comparison with existing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations demonstrates that our stochastic generative model maintains statistical consistency while offering substantial computational efficiency. Moreover, the simulated results reproduce the dynamic positional shift of the bright ring structure observed in M87$^{*}$, providing theoretical support for interpreting its time-variable images.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein ansatz from Lorentzian quantum gravity on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If Kaluza-Klein ideas were correct as an explanation of Yang-Mills and General Relativity on spacetime, the extra fibre geometry would have to be a sphere of constant size of the order of 10 Planck lengths, hence subject to quantum gravity corrections. Conversely, it was shown in previous work that modelling such corrections by noncommutative coordinates indeed forces the Kaluza-Klein cylinder ansatz form of the metric, and we now propose that the remaining restrictions needed come from quantum gravity on the fibre. Working with a fuzzy sphere fibre, we find that the expected value of the metric is indeed spherical and we propose that it can be taken as of constant size due to freedom in the renormalisation of divergences. In this way, we outline a mechanism whereby the observed structure of gravity plus Yang-Mills can emerge at low energies as a consequence of quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles III: The Hodge Star and Hodge--de Rham Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$) offer a novel perspective on intrinsic Carrollian geometry using the powerful tools of principal bundles. Given a choice of principal connection, a canonical Lorentzian metric exists on the total space. This metric enables the development of Hodge theory on a Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundle; specifically, the Hodge star operator and Hodge--de Rham Laplacian are constructed. These constructions are obstructed on a Carrollian manifold due to the degenerate metric. The framework of Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles bridges the gap between Carrollian geometry and (pseudo)-Riemannian geometry. As an example, the question of the Hodge--de Rham Laplacian on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is addressed. A Carrollian version of electromagnetism is also proposed.</description>

      <title>Inflation in f(R,T) gravity with Double-Well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this piece of work, we studied the inflation in the context of ${f(R,T)}$ theory of gravity. We assumed the functional form of ${f(R,T)}$ to be $R+ 16 \pi G \lambda T$, where R is the Ricci scalar, T is the trace of the Energy-Momentum tensor and $\lambda$ is the model parameter. The cosmological observable parameters like scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are estimated for Double-Well potential. We found that for $\lambda = 150$, $n_s$ and $r$ are in good agreement with Planck 2018 data. Further, considering the vacuum expectation value in Double-Well potential to be Planckian, we observed the admissible range of model parameter to be $145 &lt; \lambda &lt; 222$ for which this model remains consistent with Planck 2018 data.</description>

      <title>Twisting shadows: Light rings, lensing and shadows of black holes in swirling universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Ernst formalism, a novel solution of vacuum general relativity (GR) was recently obtained [1], describing a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) immersed in a nonasymptotically flat rotating background, dubbed swirling universe, with the peculiar property that north and south hemispheres spin in opposite directions. We investigate the null geodesic flow and, in particular, the existence of light rings in this vacuum geometry. By evaluating the total topological charge $w$, we show that there exists one unstable light ring ($w=-1$) for each rotation sense of the background. We observe that the swirling background drives the Schwarzschild BH light rings outside the equatorial plane, displaying counterrotating motion with respect to each other, while (both) corotating with respect to the swirling universe. Using backwards ray tracing, we obtain the shadow and gravitational lensing effects, revealing a novel feature for observers on the equatorial plane: the BH shadow displays an odd $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (north-south) symmetry, inherited from the same type of symmetry of the spacetime itself: a twisted shadow.</description>

      <title>Nature of phase transitions and metastability in scalar-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact stars above a critical stellar mass develop large scalar fields in some scalar-tensor theories. This scenario, called spontaneous scalarization, has been an intense topic of study since it passes weak-field gravity tests naturally while providing clear observables in the strong-field regime. The underlying mechanism for the onset of scalarization is often depicted as a second-order phase transition. Here, we show that a first-order phase transition is in fact the most common mechanism. This means metastability and transitions between locally stable compact object configurations are much more likely than previously believed, opening vast new avenues for observational prospects.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative Einstein-Maxwell equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfeld twist and solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the noncommutative parameter $a$. The equation of motion, the NC Einstein-Maxwell equation, turns out to be effectively a problem in nonlinear electrodynamics where the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ obtains correction terms with three Faraday tensors $F_{\mu\nu}$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole modified with nonzero $g_{t\theta}, g_{r\varphi}, g_{tr}$ and $g_{\varphi\theta}$ components proportional to $a$, while the electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr-Newman potential which introduces a nonzero $A_{\theta}$ term proportional to $a$.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Backreaction in One-Loop Corrections in Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop quantum correction to the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations in the ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflationary scenario, incorporating the backreaction effect from curvature perturbations. In the spatially-flat gauge, we expand the background inflaton field up to second order and identify the one-loop level backreaction term in the action. Utilizing a gauge transformation, we derive the comoving curvature interaction Hamiltonian in the presence of the backreaction term and calculate the one-loop correction using the in-in formalism. Our results reveal that the one-loop super-horizon corrections previously reported in the literature are canceled by the backreaction contributions. This finding underscores the importance of accounting for the backreaction effects in the analysis of quantum corrections during USR inflation.</description>

      <title>Mapping Parameter Correlations in Spinning Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spins of binary black holes measured with gravitational waves provide insights about the formation, evolution, and dynamics of these systems. However, interpreting these measurements-especially for heavy black holes-remains an open problem.While the imprint of spin during the inspiral phase, where the black holes are well-separated, is understood through analytic descriptions of the dynamics, no such expressions exist for the merger. Though numerical relativity simulations provide an exact solution (to within numerical error), the imprint of the full six spin degrees of freedom on the signal is not transparent. In the absence of analytic expressions for the merger and to advance our ability to interpret massive binary black hole spin measurements, here we propose a waveform-based approach. Leveraging a neural network to efficiently calculate mismatches between waveforms, we identify regions in the parameter space of spins and mass ratio that result in low mismatches and thus similar waveforms. We map these regions with a Gaussian fit, thus identifying correlations and quantifying their strength. For low-mass, inspiral-dominated systems, we recover the known physical imprint: larger aligned spins are correlated with more equal masses as they have opposite effects on the inspiral length. For high-mass, merger-dominated signals, a qualitatively similar correlation is present, though its shape is altered and strength decreases with larger total mass. Correlations between in-plane spins and mass ratio follow a similar trend, with their shape and strength altered as the mass increases. Our new methodology of waveform-based correlation mapping provides a first step toward systematically modeling spin effects in merger-dominated signals across the full intrinsic parameter-space and motivates future effective spin parameters beyond the reach of analytic methods.</description>

Abstract: Effective dust collapse inspired by loop quantum gravity predicts two main features for general realistic initial profiles: a quantum gravitational bounce of the stellar core, when the energy density becomes planckian, and shell-crossing singularities, arising within almost a planckian time after the bounce. The aim of this work is to study the mathematical and physical features of the effective spacetime near these singularities, through the Jacobi deviation equation. The results show that the radial and angular deviations between dust particles remain finite at both the bounce and shell-crossing singularity, providing a physical justification for extending the spacetime beyond shell-crossing singularities through weak solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exact static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in generic six-derivative gravity (i.e., without assuming specific relations between the coupling constants). Using modified Schwarzschild coordinates, we systematically classify solutions through Frobenius expansions, determining their number of free parameters and confirming previously known cases, such as the regular solutions at the origin. Importantly, we identify novel solutions absent in four-derivative gravity, including those with (double-degenerate) extreme horizons (and their near-horizon limits) that exist without matter sources, which may indicate the existence of regular black holes. We also find asymptotically (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, giving rise to an effective cosmological constant. The solutions can be classified into six main classes, and, when possible, we provide the description in standard Schwarzschild coordinates, in which they split into thirteen main solution classes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Wormhole Solutions in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of $f(R, T)$ theories extends the Einstein-Hilbert action by incorporating a general function of $R$ and $T$, the Ricci scalar and the trace of the ordinary energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$, respectively, thereby introducing a specific modification to the Einstein's field equations based on matter fields. Given that this modification is intrinsically tied to an energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ that a priori respects energy conditions, we explore the potential of $f(R, T)$ theories admitting wormhole configurations satisfying energy conditions, unlike General Relativity, which typically necessitates exotic matter sources. Consequently, we investigate the existence of dynamical wormhole geometries that either uphold energy conditions or minimize their violations within the framework of trace of energy-momentum squared gravity. To ensure the generality of our study, we consider two distinct equations of state for the matter content and systematically classify possible solutions based on constraints related to the wormhole's throat size, the coupling parameter of the theory, and the equation of state parameters.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk around a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the properties of thin accretion disks around swirling-Kerr black holes, which own an extra swirling parameter describing the rotation of the immersed universe. Our results show that the swirling parameter leaves distinct imprints on the energy flux, temperature distribution and emission spectra of the disk and gives rise to some new effects that differ from those induced by the black hole's spin. With the increasing of the swirling parameter, both the energy flux and radiated temperature in the disk increase in the inner region where circular orbital radii are smaller and decrease in the outer region where circular orbital radii are larger. In contrast, these quantities consistently increase with the black hole's spin. Although the swirling parameter and the black hole's spin parameter lead to higher cut-off frequencies, the background swirling reduces the observed luminosity of the disk at lower frequencies and enhances it only at higher frequencies, which is quite distinct from that of the black hole's spin. Furthermore, the conversion efficiency increases with the black hole's spin parameter, but decreases with the swirling parameters. Additionally, the effects of the swirling parameter are found to be suppressed by the black hole's spin parameter. These results could help us further understand the properties of thin accretion disks and the swirling of the universe background.</description>

Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers. Code availability:The implementation is open-source at https://github.com/GenliangLi/MatBYIB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, quasilocal Brown-York charges are derived that coincide in the large sphere limit with the conserved supertranslation hair and superrotation charges introduced by Hawking, Perry and Strominger in [45, 46]. Given these charges, a general scenario is outlined in which a non-rotating black hole completely evaporates after its collapse due to particle creation effects, whereby a genuine one-way traversable event horizon is never formed, but merely a two-way traversable dynamical (resp. future trapping) horizon. The formation of such a dynamical horizon has the consequence, as is demonstrated, that quasilocal energy transported by the considered charges, and thus information, can continuously escape through the black hole horizon to infinity; a mechanism which, as is argued, could possibly prevent information loss once the black hole formation and evaporation process comes to an end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>

      <title>LensingFlow: An Automated Workflow for Gravitational Wave Lensing Analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we confirm the presence of a Rindler horizon at CERN-NA63 by exploring its thermodynamics induced by the Unruh effect in their high energy channeling radiation experiments. By linking the entropy of the emitted radiation to the photon number, we find the measured spectrum to be a simple manifestation of the second law of Rindler horizon thermodynamics and thus a direct measurement of the recoil Fulling-Davies-Unruh (FDU) temperature. Moreover, since the experiment is born out of an ultra-relativistic positron, and the FDU temperature is defined in the proper frame, we find that temperature boosts as a length and thus fast objects appear colder. The spectrum also provides us with a simple setting to measure fundamental constants, and we employ it to measure the positron mass.</description>

      <title>Universal Cardy-Like Behavior of 3D Partition Functions from Supersymmetric Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^1 \times S^2$ and the corresponding 2d effective field theories arising in the limit of small ratio of radii, $\beta=R_{S^1}/R_{S^2}\to 0$. We evaluate the exact partition function of these theories in the framework of supersymmetric localization on curved backgrounds. As a result, we establish a finite-$N$ map between a particular, superconformal-index-inspired partition function and the topologically twisted index. Taking the large-$N$ limit of the partition functions, we reproduce the entropy functions of either spherically symmetric, magnetically charged, or rotating, electrically charged asymptotically AdS$_4$ black holes. We then recast the problem of evaluating the 3d partition functions directly in the framework of rigid supersymmetry. By carefully tracking the background fields, we find that in the small-$\beta$ limit, the partition functions of these 3d large-$N$ superconformal field theories have a universal behavior related to the coefficients of the R-symmetry or flavor symmetry 2-point current correlation functions, thus obtaining a universal Cardy-like formula for 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$ superconformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part I: Classical reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In this Part I we focus on the classical reduction process, and the description of the reduced phase space, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. The system is defined as the domain of dependence of a spacelike topological disk with fixed boundary metric. By solving the constraints in a constant-mean-curvature time gauge and removing all the spatial gauge redundancy, we find that the phase space is the cotangent bundle of Diff^+(S^1)/PSL(2,R), i.e., the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle modulo the projective special linear subgroup. Classically, the states correspond to causal diamonds embedded in AdS_3 (or Mink_3 if $\Lambda = 0$), with fixed corner length, and whose Cauchy surfaces have the topology of a disc.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part II: Group-theoretic quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In Part I we described the classical reduction process and the reduced phase space, $\widetilde{\mathcal P} = T^*(\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)/\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb R))$, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. Because the phase space does not have a natural linear structure, a generalization of the standard canonical (coordinate) quantization is required. In particular, as the configuration space is a homogeneous space for the $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)$ group, we apply Isham's group-theoretic quantization scheme. We propose a quantization based on (projective) unitary irreducible representations of the $\text{BMS}_3$ group, which is obtained from a natural prescription for extending $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)$ into a transitive group of symplectic symmetries of the phase space. We find a class of suitable quantum theories labelled by a choice of a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group and an irreducible unitary representation of the corresponding little group. The most natural choice, justified by a Casimir matching principle, corresponds to a Hilbert space realized by wavefunctions on $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)/\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb R)$ valued in some unitary irreducible representation of $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb R)$. A surprising result is that the twist of the diamond corner loop is quantized in terms of the ratio of the Planck length to the corner perimeter.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit, on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the domain of validity of a quantum optical model describing the effects of gravitational redshift on the quantum state of photons that propagate in curved spacetime. We find that the model is consistent for small redshift, but fails for larger redshifts. Surprisingly, the range of the redshift for which the model applies is conditional not only to the gravitational parameters, but also to those that define the photonic modes. We provide an analysis to characterize this aspect and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss implications for theoretical science as well as for the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence, from the viewpoint of covariant phase space formalism (CPSF). In particular, we elucidate the role of the $W, Y$, and $Z$ freedoms (also known as ambiguities) in the CPSF and their meaning in the gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side, which has been related to deformations by multi-trace operators in the gauge theory side. The gauge/gravity correspondence implies the equivalence of on-shell symplectic potentials on both sides, thereby the $Y$-freedom of the gravity side specifies the on-shell symplectic form of the gauge theory side. The $Z$-freedom, which determines the corner Lagrangian on the gravity side, establishes the boundary conditions and choice of slicing in the boundary theory and its solution space. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on the gravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions, and discuss some examples with different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational interaction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly isolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If a suitable resonance condition is satisfied, an optical signal can be transmitted from one system to the other over a narrow frequency band, a phenomenon that we call gravitationally induced transparency. In this framework, the challenging problem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task of determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical channel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must have a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any assumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum regime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic Hamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian thermal attenuator channel between the two systems. Depending on the strength of thermal noise, the system presents a sharp transition from an entanglement-breaking to a non-classical channel capable not only of entanglement preservation but also of asymptotically perfect quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $\kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF) $ D(t) $ obtained through a QCD analysis of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By comparing pressure profiles extracted from skewness-dependent GPDs with previous determinations based on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data, we establish updated bounds on $\kappa$. Our results show that the choice of proton pressure model significantly impacts the constraints, with the strongest limits ($|\kappa| \leq 0.10\text{--}0.3\, \text{m}^5\, \text{kg}^{-1}\, \text{s}^{-2}$). We further demonstrate that constraints obtained based on the first and second moments of the pressure distribution yield competitive bounds compared to those derived from peak pressures or those derived from just the first moment. These findings highlight the importance of precise experimental and theoretical determinations of the proton's mechanical properties in testing alternative theories of gravity. The present study motivates future improvements in GPD reconstructions for stronger constraints on EiBI gravity and related modifications.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from five-dimensional inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was proposed that five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Moreover, it was shown that 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Here we compute the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and show that unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances, due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times. Moreover there is an additional enhancement in the squeezed limit.</description>

      <title>Dirac brackets for classical radiative observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new coherent state expansion of the exponential representation of the S-matrix for the classical gravitational two-body problem. By combining the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism with the Dirac bracket structure emerging in the classical limit, we derive compact and gauge-invariant expressions for scattering observables in the presence of radiation. This causal formulation bypasses the calculation of KMOC cuts and provides a direct link between observables and a minimal set of classical matrix elements extracted from amplitudes. We illustrate our method with several examples, including the impulse, spin kick, angular momentum, waveform and the related radiative fluxes. Finally, using our formalism we evaluate for the first time the spin kick and the change in angular momentum of each particle up to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 s_1^{j_1} s_2^{j_2})$ with $j_1+ j_2 \leq 11$.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian frequency estimation at the fundamental quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching for a weak signal at an unknown frequency is a canonical task in experiments probing fundamental physics such as gravitational-wave observatories and ultra-light dark matter haloscopes. These state-of-the-art sensors are limited by quantum noise arising from the fundamental uncertainty about the state of the device. Classically, frequency estimation suffers from a threshold effect in the signal-to-noise ratio such that weak signals are extremely hard to localise in frequency. We show that this phenomenon persists at the fundamental quantum limit but that the classical approach, a quadrature measurement, can nevertheless be beaten by a coherent protocol of projecting onto the "quantum whitened" possible quantum states. Quantum whitening is a covariant measurement, and we examine it analytically in the wide-prior limit and numerically for finite-width priors. Beyond accelerating searches for unknown frequencies, quantum whitening may be used generally to sense the parameter of a unitary encoding given no prior information about the parameter.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Matter: Chiral Soliton Lattices in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the framework of holographic QCD in magnetic field. Under appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and the quark mass deformation, we demonstrate that the ground state in the gravitational dual of QCD is given by the CSL in the background magnetic field and the baryon number density. In the presence of the background magnetic field, we show that the CSL is interpreted as a uniformly distributed D4-branes in the holographic setup, where the chiral soliton is identified with a non-self-dual instanton vortex or a center vortex in the five dimensional bulk gauge theory. While the baryon numbers are given to chiral solitons as well as Skyrmions due to the different terms in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term in the chiral perturbation theory, these baryon numbers with different origins are unified in terms of the instanton charge density in five dimensions. With bulk analysis of the WZW term, we find that the pion decay constant becomes dependent on the magnetic field. For the massless pion case, we obtain an analytical form that is in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results for strong magnetic fields.</description>
