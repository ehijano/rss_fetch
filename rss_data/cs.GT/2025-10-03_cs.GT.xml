      <title>Learning to Play Multi-Follower Bayesian Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$ possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round, we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers' actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T \log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Designing Inferable Signaling Schemes for Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bayesian persuasion, an informed sender, who observes a state, commits to a randomized signaling scheme that guides a self-interested receiver's actions. Classical models assume the receiver knows the commitment. We, instead, study the setting where the receiver infers the scheme from repeated interactions. We bound the sender's performance loss relative to the known-commitment case by a term that grows with the signal space size and shrinks as the receiver's optimal actions become more distinct. We then lower bound the samples required for the sender to approximately achieve their known-commitment performance in the inference setting. We show that the sender requires more samples in persuasion compared to the leader in a Stackelberg game, which includes commitment but lacks signaling. Motivated by these bounds, we propose two methods for designing inferable signaling schemes, one being stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the sender's inference-setting utility, and the other being optimization with a boundedly-rational receiver model. SGD performs best in low-interaction regimes, but modeling the receiver as boundedly-rational and tuning the rationality constant still provides a flexible method for designing inferable schemes. Finally, we apply SGD to a safety alert example and show it to find schemes that have fewer signals and make citizens' optimal actions more distinct compared to the known-commitment case.</description>

      <title>Incentive Analysis of Collusion in Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fair division problems with strategic agents capable of gaining advantages by manipulating their reported preferences. Although several impossibility results have revealed the incompatibility of truthfulness with standard fairness criteria, subsequent works have circumvented this limitation through the incentive ratio framework. Previous studies demonstrate that fundamental mechanisms like Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) and Probabilistic Serial (PS) for divisible goods, and Round-Robin (RR) for indivisible goods achieve an incentive ratio of $2$, implying that no individual agent can gain more than double his truthful utility through manipulation. However, collusive manipulation by agent groups remains unexplored.
  In this work, we define strong group incentive ratio (SGIR) and group incentive ratio (GIR) to measure the gain of collusive manipulation, where SGIR and GIR are respectively the maximum and minimum of the incentive ratios of corrupted agents. Then, we tightly characterize the SGIRs and GIRs of MNW, PS, and RR. In particular, the GIR of MNW is $2$ regardless of the coalition size. Moreover, for coalition size $c \geq 1$, the SGIRs of MNW and PS, and the GIRs of PS and RR are $c + 1$. Finally, the SGIR of RR is unbounded for coalition size $c \geq 2$. Our results reveal fundamental differences of these three mechanisms in their vulnerability to collusion.</description>

      <title>A Linear Programming Approach to Estimate the Core in Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel algorithm to approximate the core of transferable utility (TU) cooperative games via linear programming. Given the computational hardness of determining the full core, our approach provides a tractable approximation by sampling extreme points through randomized linear problems (LPs). We analyze its convergence and computational complexity, and validate its effectiveness through extensive simulations on various game models. Our results show that the method is scalable and achieves high accuracy in terms of core reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Multi-group Bayesian Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model of multi-group Bayesian games (MBGs) to describe the group behavior in Bayesian games, and gives methods to find (strongly) multi-group Bayesian Nash equilibria (MBNE) of this model with a proposed transformation. MBNE represent the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the situation where players within a group play a cooperative game, while strongly MBNE characterize the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the situation where players within a group play a noncooperative game. Firstly, we propose a model of MBGs and give a transformation to convert any MBG into a multi-group ex-ante agent game (MEAG) which is a normal-form game. Secondly, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for a MBG's MEAG to be (strongly) potential. If it is (strongly) potential, all its (strongly) Nash equilibria can be found, and then all (strongly) MBNE of the MBG can be obtained by leveraging the transformation's good properties. Finally, we provide algorithms for finding (strongly) MBNE of a MBG whose MEAG is (strongly) potential and use an illustrative example to verify the correctness of our results.</description>

      <title>Beyond Majority Voting: LLM Aggregation by Leveraging Higher-Order Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning, how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally, failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions, leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust multi-agent LLM pipelines.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the optimal reward functions (scoring rules) that incentivize an agent to acquire information and report it truthfully to the principal. The optimal scoring rules let the agent make a simple binary bet in single-dimensional problems, and choose the dimension with the most surprising signal to be scored on in symmetric multi-dimensional problems. This scoring rule format remains approximately optimal for asymmetric distributions. These results demonstrate the importance of linking incentives to obtain high-quality information in multi-dimensional problems. In contrast, standard scoring rules like the quadratic scoring rule, or averages of single-dimensional scoring rules can be far from optimal.</description>

      <title>Pandora's Box Problem With Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In the simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a hidden random reward. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive order, and gains the difference between the largest revealed reward and the sum of the inspection costs. Although this classic version is well understood (Weitzman 1979), there is a flourishing recent literature on variants of the problem. Here we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., by constraining the schedules of exploration and influencing costs and rewards. In our framework, boxes have time-dependent rewards and costs, whereas inspection may require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time. Our main result is an efficient constant-factor approximation to the optimal strategy for the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, which is generally NP-hard to compute. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, boxes are available only in specific time slots, or when costs and reward distributions are time-independent (but rewards may still deteriorate after inspection).</description>

      <title>A Management Framework for Vehicular Cloudtoward Economic and Environmental Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) leverages the idle computing capacity of vehicles to execute end-users' offloaded tasks without requiring new computation infrastructure. Despite its conceptual appeal, VCC adoption is hindered by the lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating its profitability and environmental advantages in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles the fundamental question: Can VCC be both profitable and sustainable? We address this problem by proposing a management scheme for VCC that combines energy-aware task allocation with a game-theoretic revenue-sharing mechanism. Our framework is the first to jointly model latency, energy consumption, monetary incentives, and carbon emissions within urban mobility and 5G communication settings. The task allocation strategy maximizes the aggregate stakeholder utility while satisfying deadlines and minimizing energy costs. The payoffs are distributed via a coalitional game theory adapted to dynamic vehicular environments, to prevent disincentivizing participants with potentially negative contributions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach supports low-latency task execution, enables effective monetization of vehicular resources, and reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99% compared to conventional edge infrastructures, making VCC a practical and sustainable alternative to edge computing.</description>

      <title>Paper Quality Assessment based on Individual Wisdom Metrics from Open Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional closed peer review systems, which have played a central role in scientific publishing, are often slow, costly, non-transparent, stochastic, and possibly subject to biases - factors that can impede scientific progress and undermine public trust. Here, we propose and examine the efficacy and accuracy of an alternative form of scientific peer review: through an open, bottom-up process. First, using data from two major scientific conferences (CCN2023 and ICLR2023), we highlight how high variability of review scores and low correlation across reviewers presents a challenge for collective review. We quantify reviewer agreement with community consensus scores and use this as a reviewer quality estimator, showing that surprisingly, reviewer quality scores are not correlated with authorship quality. Instead, we reveal an inverted U-shape relationship, where authors with intermediate paper scores are the best reviewers. We assess empirical Bayesian methods to estimate paper quality based on different assessments of individual reviewer reliability. We show how under a one-shot review-then-score scenario, both in our models and on real peer review data, a Bayesian measure significantly improves paper quality assessments relative to simple averaging. We then consider an ongoing model of publishing, reviewing, and scoring, with reviewers scoring not only papers but also other reviewers. We show that user-generated reviewer ratings can yield robust and high-quality paper scoring even when unreliable (but unbiased) reviewers dominate. Finally, we outline incentive structures to recognize high-quality reviewers and encourage broader reviewing coverage of submitted papers. These findings suggest that a self-selecting open peer review process is potentially scalable, reliable, and equitable with the possibility of enhancing the speed, fairness, and transparency of the peer review process.</description>
