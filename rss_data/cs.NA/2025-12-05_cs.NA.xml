      <title>Iterative Contact-resolving Hybrid Methods for Multiscale Contact Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling contact mechanics with high contrast coefficients presents significant mathematical and computational challenges, especially in achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations. Due to the inherent nonlinearity of contact problems, conventional methods that treat the entire domain as a monolithic system often lead to high global complexity. To address this, we develop an iterative contact-resolving hybrid method by localizing nonlinear contact constraints within a smaller subdomain, while the larger subdomain is governed by a linear system. Our system employs variational inequality theory, minimization principles, and penalty methods. More importantly, we propose four discretization types within the two-subdomain framework, ranging from applying standard/mixed FEM across the entire domain to combining standard/mixed multiscale methods in the larger subdomain with standard/mixed FEM in the smaller one. % The standard finite element method and standard constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method are simple and easy to demonstrate. By employing a multiscale reduction technique, the method avoids excessive degrees of freedom inherent in conventional methods in the larger domain, while the mixed formulation enables direct stress computation, ensures local momentum conservation, and resists locking in nearly incompressible materials. Convergence analysis and the corresponding algorithms are provided for all cases. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the approaches.</description>

      <title>Stable self-adaptive timestepping for Reduced Order Models for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces RedEigCD, the first self-adaptive timestepping technique specifically tailored for reduced-order models (ROMs) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon linear stability concepts, the method adapts the timestep by directly bounding the stability function of the employed time integration scheme using exact spectral information of matrices related to the reduced operators. Unlike traditional error-based adaptive methods, RedEigCD relies on the eigenbounds of the convective and diffusive ROM operators, whose computation is feasible at reduced scale and fully preserves the online efficiency of the ROM. A central theoretical contribution of this work is the proof, based on the combined theorems of Bendixson and Rao, that, under linearized assumptions, the maximum stable timestep for projection-based ROMs is shown to be larger than or equal to that of their corresponding full-order models (FOMs). Numerical experiments for both periodic and non-homogeneous boundary conditions demonstrate that RedEigCD yields stable timestep increases up to a factor 40 compared to the FOM, without compromising accuracy. The methodology thus establishes a new link between linear stability theory and reduced-order modeling, offering a systematic path towards efficient, self-regulating ROM integration in incompressible flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Interface layers and coupling conditions for discrete kinetic models on networks: a spectral approac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider kinetic and related macroscopic equations on networks. A class of linear kinetic BGK models is considered, where the limit equation for small Knudsen numbers is given by the wave equation. Coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations are obtained from the kinetic coupling conditions via an asymptotic analysis near the nodes of the network and the consideration of coupled solutions of kinetic half-space problems. Analytical results are obtained for a discrete velocity version of the coupled half-space problems. Moreover, an efficient spectral method is developed to solve the coupled discrete velocity half-space problems. In particular, this allows to determine the relevant coefficients in the coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations
  from the underlying kinetic network problem. These coefficients correspond to the so-called extrapolation length for kinetic boundary value problems. Numerical results show the accuracy and fast convergence of the approach. Moreover, a comparison of the kinetic solution on the network with the macroscopic solution is presented.</description>

      <title>Weighted total variation regularization for inverse problems with significant null spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inverse problems with large null spaces, which arise in important applications such as in inverse ECG and EEG procedures. Standard regularization methods typically produce solutions in or near the orthogonal complement of the forward operator's null space. This often leads to inadequate results, where internal sources are mistakenly interpreted as being near the data acquisition sites -- e.g., near or at the body surface in connection with EEG and ECG recordings.
  To mitigate this, we previously proposed weighting schemes for Tikhonov and sparsity regularization. Here, we extend this approach to total variation (TV) regularization, which is particularly suited for identifying spatially extended regions with approximately constant values. We introduce a weighted TV-regularization method, provide supporting analysis, and demonstrate its performance through numerical experiments. Unlike standard TV regularization, the weighted version successfully recovers the location and size of large, piecewise constant sources away from the boundary, though not their exact shape.
  Additionally, we explore a hybrid weighted-sparsity and TV regularization approach, which better captures both small and large sources, albeit with somewhat more blurred reconstructions than the weighted TV method alone.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in the numerical solution of multi-order fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient numerical solution of fractional differential equations has been recently tackled through the definition of Fractional HBVMs (FHBVMs), a class of Runge-Kutta type methods. Corresponding Matlab (c) codes have been also made available on the internet, proving to be very competitive w.r.t. existing ones. However, so far, FHBVMs have been given for solving systems of fractional differential equations with the same order of fractional derivative, whereas the numerical solution of multi-order problems (i.e., problems in which different orders of fractional derivatives occur) has not been handled, yet. Due to their relevance in applications, in this paper we propose an extension of FHBVMs for addressing fractional multi-order problems, providing full details for such an approach. A corresponding Matlab (c) code, handling the case of two different fractional orders, is also made available, proving very effective for numerically solving these problems.</description>

      <title>Construction of the Nearest Nonnegative Hankel Matrix for a Prescribed Eigenpair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a prescribed eigenpair $(\lambda,x)$
  can be made an exact eigenpair of a nonnegative Hankel matrix through the smallest
  possible structured perturbation. The task reduces to check the feasibility of a
  set of linear constraints that encode both the Hankel structure and entrywise
  nonnegativity. When the feasibility set is nonempty, we compute the minimum-norm
  perturbation $\Delta H$ such that $(H+\Delta H)x=\lambda x$. When no such perturbation
  exists, we compute the nearest nonnegative Hankel matrix in a residual sense by
  minimizing $\|(H+\Delta H)x-\lambda x\|_{2}$ subject to the imposed constraints.
  Because closed-form formulas for the structured backward error are generally
  unavailable, our method provides a fully numerical and optimization-based
  framework for evaluating eigenpair sensitivity under nonnegativity-preserving
  Hankel perturbations. Numerical examples illustrate both feasible and infeasible cases.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical matrix approximability of inverse of convection dominated finite element matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several researchers have developed a rich toolbox of matrix compression techniques that exploit structure and redundancy in large matrices. Classical methods such as the block low-rank format and the Fast Multipole Method make it possible to manipulate very large systems by representing them in a reduced form. Among the most sophisticated tools in this area are hierarchical matrices (H-matrices), which exploit local properties of the underlying kernel or operator to approximate matrix blocks by low-rank factors, organized in a recursive hierarchy. H-matrices offer a flexible and scalable framework, yielding nearly linear complexity in both storage and computation. Hierarchical matrix techniques, originally developed for boundary integral equations, have recently been applied to matrices stemming from the discretization of advection-dominated problems. However, their effectiveness is limited by the loss of coercivity induced by convection phenomena, where traditional methods fail. Initial work by Le Borne addressed this by modifying the admissibility criterion for structured grids with constant convection, but challenges remain for more general grids and advection fields. In this work, we propose a novel partitioning strategy based on "convection tubes", clusters aligned with the convection vector field. This method does not require a structured grid or constant convection, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. We present both theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, that demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method for convection-dominated PDEs on unstructured grids. The approach builds on a P\'eclet-robust Caccioppoli inequality, crucial for handling convection-dominated problems.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Discretization Scheme for Surface Integral Equations for Analyzing the Electroencephalography Forward Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Nystrom-based high-order (HO) discretization scheme for surface integral equations (SIEs) for analyzing the electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem is proposed in this work. We use HO surface elements and interpolation functions for the discretization of the interfaces of the head volume and the unknowns on the elements, respectively. The advantage of this work over existing isoparametric HO discretization schemes resides in the fact that the interpolation points are different from the mesh nodes, allowing for the flexible manipulation of the order of the basis functions without regenerating the mesh of the interfaces. Moreover, the interpolation points are chosen from the quadrature rules with the same number of points on the elements simplifying the numerical computation of the surface integrals for the far-interaction case. In this contribution, we extend the implementation of the HO discretization scheme to the double-layer and the adjoint double-layer formulations, as well as to the isolated-skull-approach for the double-layer formulation and to the indirect adjoint double-layer formulation, employed to improve the solution accuracy in case of high conductivity contrast models, which requires the development of different techniques for the singularity treatment. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme for the four SIEs for analyzing the EEG forward problem.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Methods for Delay Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methodologies are nowadays ubiquitous. Their rapid development and spread have led to applications even beyond the traditional fields of science. As far as dynamical systems and differential equations are concerned, neural networks and sparse identification tools have emerged as powerful approaches to recover the governing equations from available temporal data series. In this chapter we first illustrate possible extensions of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, originally developed for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to delay differential equations (DDEs) with discrete, possibly multiple and unknown delays. Two methods are presented for SINDy, one directly tackles the underlying DDE and the other acts on the system of ODEs approximating the DDE through pseudospectral collocation. We also introduce another way of capturing the dynamics of DDEs using neural networks and trainable delays in continuous time, and present the training algorithms developed for these neural delay differential equations (NDDEs). The relevant MATLAB implementations for both the SINDy approach and for the NDDE approach are provided. These approaches are tested on several examples, including classical systems such as the delay logistic and the Mackey-Glass equation, and directly compared to each other on the delayed R\"ossler system. We provide insights on the connection between the approaches and future directions on developing data-driven methods for time delay systems.</description>

      <title>Weak convergence rates for spectral regularization via sampling inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence rates in spectral regularization methods quantify the approximation error in inverse problems as a function of the noise level or the number of sampling points. Classical strong convergence rate results typically rely on source conditions, which are essential for estimating the truncation error. However, in the framework of kernel approximation, the truncation error in the case of Tikhonov regularization can be characterized entirely through sampling inequalities, without invoking source conditions. In this paper, we first generalize sampling inequalities to spectral regularization, and then, by exploiting the connection between inverse problems and kernel approximation, we derive weak convergence rate bounds for inverse problems, independently of source conditions. These weak convergence rates are established and analyzed when the forward operator is compact and uniformly bounded, or the kernel operator is of trace class.</description>

      <title>A tangential low-rank ADI method for solving indefinite Lyapunov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time algebraic Lyapunov equations have become an essential tool in various applications. In the case of large-scale sparse coefficient matrices and indefinite constant terms, indefinite low-rank factorizations have successfully been used to allow methods like the alternating direction implicit (ADI) iteration to efficiently compute accurate approximations to the solution of the Lyapunov equation. However, classical block-type approaches quickly increase in computational costs when the rank of the constant term grows. In this paper, we propose a novel tangential reformulation of the ADI iteration that allows for the efficient construction of low-rank approximations to the solution of Lyapunov equations with indefinite right-hand sides even in the case of constant terms with higher ranks. We provide adaptive methods for the selection of the corresponding ADI parameters, namely shifts and tangential directions, which allow for the automatic application of the method to any relevant problem setting. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is illustrated by several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Effective permeabilities for flow through anisotropic microscopic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a computational and theoretical framework for determining effective permeabilities in anisotropic microscopic geometries containing dense, fibre-like obstacles, motivated by the need to model flow in coiled aneurysm domains accurately. Building on homogenisation theory and fully resolved simulations in Representative Elementary Volumes (REVs), we validate the permeability model introduced in [C. Boutin, Study of permeability by periodic and self-consistent homogenisation. Eur. J. Mech. A Solids, 19(4):603-632, 2000] and propose a systematic methodology for capturing the directional variations induced by fibre orientation. The resulting permeability tensors are incorporated into macroscopic flow simulations based on the Darcy equation, enabling direct comparison of anisotropic and isotropic permeability models across several benchmark configurations. Our findings show that anisotropy has a significant impact on local flow direction and magnitude, generating directional permeability contrasts which cannot be reproduced by classical isotropic approximations. By integrating coil-induced microstructural effects into continuum-scale hemodynamic models, the proposed approach enables more realistic assessment of post-treatment aneurysm flow behaviour. Beyond this clinical application, the framework is broadly applicable to other biomedical and engineering systems involving fibrous or filamentous porous microstructures.</description>

      <title>On the Construction of High-Order and Exact Pressure Equilibrium Schemes for Arbitrary Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical fully conservative discretizations of the Euler compressible single or multi-component fluid equations governed by a real-fluid equation of state exhibit spurious pressure oscillations due to the nonlinearity of the thermodynamic relation between pressure, density, and internal energy. A fully conservative, pressure-equilibrium preserving method and a high-order, fully conservative, approximate pressure-equilibrium preserving method are presented. Both methods are general and can handle an arbitrary equation of state and arbitrary number of species. Unlike existing approaches to discretize the multi-component Euler equations, we do not introduce non conservative updates, overspecified equations, or design for a specific equation of state. The proposed methods are demonstrated on inviscid smooth interface advection problems governed by three equations of state: ideal-gas, stiffened-gas, and van der Waals where we show orders of magnitude reductions in spurious pressure oscillations compared to existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Can Explicit Subgrid Models Enhance Implicit LES Simulations? A GPU-Oriented High-Order-Solver Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods offer excellent accuracy for turbulent flow simulations, especially when implemented on GPU-oriented architectures that favor very high polynomial orders. On modern GPUs, high-order polynomial evaluations cost roughly the same as low-order ones, provided the DG degrees of freedom fit within device memory. However, even with high-order discretizations, simulations at high Reynolds numbers still require some level of under-resolution, leaving them sensitive to numerical dissipation and aliasing effects. Here, we investigate the interplay between intrinsic DG dissipation mechanisms (implicit dissipation) -- in particular split forms and Riemann solvers -- and explicit subgrid-scale models in Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Using the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex at $Re = 1600$ and an inviscid case ($Re \to \infty$), we evaluate kinetic energy dissipation, spectral accuracy, and numerical stability.
  Our results show that when stability for under-resolved turbulence is ensured through split-forms (energy- or entropy-stable) schemes, subgrid-scale (SGS) LES models are not strictly necessary. At moderate Reynolds numbers, when the spatial resolution is sufficient to capture the relevant turbulence scales (i.e., in well-resolved LES), adding SGS models does not improve accuracy because the wavenumber range where they act overlaps with the inherent numerical dissipation of the DG scheme. In contrast, when the resolution is insufficient, as is typical at high Reynolds numbers, explicit subgrid-scale models complement the numerical dissipation and enhance accuracy by removing the excess energy that numerical fluxes alone cannot dissipate.
  These findings provide practical guidance for choosing numerical strategies in high-order turbulence simulations.</description>

      <title>A Unified Low-rank ADI Framework with Shared Linear Solves for Simultaneously Solving Multiple Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known in the literature that the low-rank ADI method for Lyapunov equations is a Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithm that implicitly performs model order reduction. In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive.
  Since all ADI methods implicitly perform model order reduction when solving these linear matrix equations, we show that the resulting reduced-order models can be obtained as an additional byproduct. These models not only interpolate the original transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts but also preserve important system properties such as stability, minimum-phase property, positive-realness, bounded-realness, and passivity. Consequently, the proposed unified ADI framework also serves as a recursive, interpolation-based model order reduction method, which can preserve several important properties of the original model in the reduced-order model.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Semi-Discrete WaveHoltz Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that for stable semi-discretizations of the wave equation for the WaveHoltz iteration is guaranteed to converge to an approximate solution of the corresponding frequency domain problem, if it exists. We show that for certain classes of frequency domain problems, the WaveHoltz iteration without acceleration converges in $O({\omega})$ iterations with the constant factor depending logarithmically on the desired tolerance. We conjecture that the Helmholtz problem in open domains with no trapping waves is one such class of problems and we provide numerical examples in one and two dimensions using finite differences and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations which demonstrate these converge results.</description>

      <title>A generalized Active Flux method of arbitrarily high order in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Active Flux method can be seen as an extended finite volume method. The degrees of freedom of this method are cell averages, as in finite volume methods, and in addition shared point values at the cell interfaces, giving rise to a globally continuous reconstruction. Its classical version was introduced as a one-stage fully discrete, third-order method. Recently, a semi-discrete version of the Active Flux method was presented with various extensions to arbitrarily high order in one space dimension. In this paper we extend the semi-discrete Active Flux method on two-dimensional Cartesian grids to arbitrarily high order, by including moments as additional degrees of freedom (hybrid finite element--finite volume method). The stability of this method is studied for linear advection. For a fully discrete version, using an explicit Runge-Kutta method, a CFL restriction is derived. We end by presenting numerical examples for hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Low-order finite element complex with application to a fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-order nonconforming finite element discretization of a smooth de Rham complex starting from the $H^2$ space in three dimensions is proposed, involving an $H^2$-nonconforming finite element space, a new tangentially continuous $H^1$-nonconforming vector-valued finite element space, the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas space, and piecewise constant functions. While nonconforming for the smooth complex, the discretization conforms to the classical de Rham complex. It is applied to develop a decoupled mixed finite element method for a fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem, focusing on the discretization of a generalized singularly perturbed Stokes-type equation. In contrast to Nitsche's method, which requires additional stabilization to handle boundary layers, the nodal interpolation operator for the lowest-order N\'{e}d\'{e}lec element of the second kind is introduced into the discrete bilinear forms. This modification yields a decoupled mixed method that achieves optimal convergence rates uniformly with respect to the perturbation parameter, even in the presence of strong boundary layers, without requiring any additional stabilization.</description>

      <title>Mean-square exponential stability of exact and numerical solutions for neutral stochastic delay differential equations with Markovian switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mean-square exponential stability of neutral stochastic differential delay equations (NSDDEs) with Markovian switching. The analysis addresses the complexities arising from the interaction between the neutral term, time-varying delays, and structural changes governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. We establish novel and practical criteria for the mean-square exponential stability of both the underlying system and its numerical approximations via the Euler-Maruyama method. Furthermore, we prove that the numerical scheme can reproduce the exponential decay rate of the true solution with arbitrary accuracy, provided the step size is sufficiently small. The theoretical results are supported by a numerical example that illustrates their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and invariant measure approximation of the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation via an explicit fully discrete scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation (SCHE) driven by additive space-time white noise. We first refine the analytical ergodic theory by proving that the continuum equation admits a unique invariant measure in the more regular state space H_\alpha, extending the classical result of Da Prato and Debussche (1996) on the negative Sobolev space $\dot{H}^{-1}_\alpha$. To approximate long-time behaviour, we introduce an explicit fully discrete scheme that combines a finite-difference spatial discretization with a strongly tamed exponential Euler method in time. Uniform-in-time moment bounds in the $L^\infty$-norm are established for the numerical solution, and a uniform strong convergence estimate with an explicit rate is derived for the fully discrete approximation. Exploiting a mass-preserving minorization tailored to Neumann boundary conditions, we further show that the numerical scheme is geometrically ergodic and possesses a unique invariant measure, together with polynomial-order error bounds for approximating the exact invariant measure. Strong laws of large numbers are proved for both the continuous and discrete systems, ensuring almost-sure convergence of temporal averages to the corresponding ergodic limits. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, including the long-time strong convergence and the accuracy of invariant measure approximation. Overall, the results provide a complete analytical and numerical framework for investigating the long-time statistical behaviour of the SCHE.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Adaptive Isotropic and Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Numerical Simulations Involving Cerebral Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented are two techniques that are designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the numerical modeling process. The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.</description>
