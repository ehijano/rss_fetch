      <title>AdvQuNN: A Methodology for Analyzing the Adversarial Robustness of Quanvolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have led to the development of hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) that employ a mixed set of quantum layers and classical layers, such as Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs). While several works have shown security threats of classical neural networks, such as adversarial attacks, their impact on QuNNs is still relatively unexplored. This work tackles this problem by designing AdvQuNN, a specialized methodology to investigate the robustness of HQNNs like QuNNs against adversarial attacks. It employs different types of Ansatzes as parametrized quantum circuits and different types of adversarial attacks. This study aims to rigorously assess the influence of quantum circuit architecture on the resilience of QuNN models, which opens up new pathways for enhancing the robustness of QuNNs and advancing the field of quantum cybersecurity. Our results show that, compared to classical convolutional networks, QuNNs achieve up to 60\% higher robustness for the MNIST and 40\% for FMNIST datasets.</description>

      <title>Transfer and routing of Gaussian states through quantum complex networks with and without community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal in quantum state transfer is to avoid the need to physically transport carriers of quantum information. This is achieved by using a suitably engineered Hamiltonian that induces the transfer of the state of one subsystem to another. A less known generalization of state transfer considers multiple systems such that any pair can exchange quantum information and transfers can take place at any time, starting and stopping independently. This is sometimes called routing of quantum states. State transfer in particular has received a great deal of attention, however the vast majority of results in both state transfer and routing concern qubits transferred in a network of restricted structure. Here we consider routing of single-mode Gaussian states and entanglement through complex networks of quantum harmonic oscillators. We compare a protocol where the transfer is completed in a single step but the effective Hamiltonian only approximately transfers the state with one where the transfer can in principle be perfect but the transfer is done in two steps, and also illustrate the state-dependency of the transfer fidelity. We find that even in a random and homogeneous network, the transfer fidelity still depends on the degree of the nodes for any link density, and that in both random and complex networks it is the community structure that controls the appearance of higher frequency normal modes useful for transfer. Finally, we find that networks of sufficient complexity may have superior routing performance over superficially similar random networks. Our results pave the way for further exploration of the role of community structure in state transfer and related tasks.</description>

      <title>Q-CHOP: Quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems that arise in science and industry typically have constraints. Yet the presence of constraints makes them challenging to tackle using both classical and quantum optimization algorithms. We propose a new quantum algorithm for constrained optimization, which we call quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization (Q-CHOP). Our algorithm leverages the observation that for many problems, while the best solution is difficult to find, the worst feasible (constraint-satisfying) solution is known. The basic idea is to to enforce a Hamiltonian constraint at all times, thereby restricting evolution to the subspace of feasible states, and slowly "rotate" an objective Hamiltonian to trace an adiabatic path from the worst feasible state to the best feasible state. We additionally propose a version of Q-CHOP that can start in any feasible state. Finally, we benchmark Q-CHOP against the commonly-used adiabatic algorithm with constraints enforced using a penalty term and find that Q-CHOP performs consistently better on a wide range of problems, including textbook problems on graphs, knapsack, combinatorial auction, as well as a real-world financial use case, namely bond exchange-traded fund basket optimization.</description>

      <title>Applications of model-aware reinforcement learning in Bayesian quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important practical problem in the field of quantum metrology and sensors is to find the optimal sequences of controls for the quantum probe that realize optimal adaptive estimation. In Belliardo et al., arXiv:2312.16985 (2023), we solved this problem in general, by introducing a procedure capable of optimizing a wide range of tasks in quantum metrology and estimation by combining model-aware reinforcement learning with Bayesian inference. We take a model-based approach to the optimisation where the physics describing the system is explicitly taken into account in the training through automatic differentiation. In this follow-up paper we present some applications of the framework. The first family of examples concerns the estimation of magnetic fields, hyperfine interactions, and decoherence times for electronic spins in diamond. For these examples, we perform multiple Ramsey measurements on the spin. The second family of applications concerns the estimation of phases and coherent states on photonic circuits, without squeezing elements, where the bosonic lines are measured by photon counters. This exposition showcases the broad applicability of the method, which has been implemented in the qsensoropt library released on PyPI, which can be installed with pip.</description>

      <title>Investigation into the Potential of Parallel Quantum Annealing for Simultaneous Optimization of Multiple Problems: A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel Quantum Annealing is a technique to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously. Parallel quantum annealing aims to optimize the utilization of available qubits on a quantum topology by addressing multiple independent problems in a single annealing cycle. This study provides insights into the potential and the limitations of this parallelization method. The experiments consisting of two different problems are integrated, and various problem dimensions are explored including normalization techniques using specific methods such as DWaveSampler with Default Embedding, DWaveSampler with Custom Embedding and LeapHybridSampler. This method minimizes idle qubits and holds promise for substantial speed-up, as indicated by the Time-to-Solution (TTS) metric, compared to traditional quantum annealing, which solves problems sequentially and may leave qubits unutilized.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Shaping of Quantum Light Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical method for the deterministic shaping of quantum light via photon number state selective interactions. Nonclassical states of light are an essential resource for high precision optical techniques that rely on photon correlations and noise reshaping. Notable techniques include quantum enhanced interferometry, ghost imaging, and generating fault tolerant codes for continuous variable optical quantum computing. We show that a class of nonlinear-optical resonators can transform many-photon wavefunctions to produce structured states of light with nonclassical noise statistics. The devices, based on parametric down conversion, utilize the Kerr effect to tune photon number dependent frequency matching, inducing photon number selective interactions. With a high amplitude coherent pump, the number selective interaction shapes the noise of a two-mode squeezed cavity state with minimal dephasing, illustrated with simulations. We specify the requisite material properties to build the device and highlight the remaining material degrees of freedom which offer flexible material design.</description>

      <title>Quantum-HPC Framework with multi-GPU-Enabled Hybrid Quantum-Classical Workflow: Applications in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-performance computation on quantum systems presents a formidable challenge that necessitates bridging the capabilities between quantum hardware and classical computing resources. This study introduces an innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture, which integrates cutting-edge quantum software framework works with high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum simulation for materials and condensed matter physics. At the heart of this architecture is the seamless integration of VQE algorithms running on QPUs for efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and QCNNs for classifying quantum states on classical hardware.
  For benchmarking quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional CPU-based methods. This significant acceleration enables models such as the transverse field Ising and XXZ systems to accurately predict phase transitions with a 99.5% accuracy. The architecture's ability to distribute computation between QPUs and classical resources addresses critical bottlenecks in Quantum-HPC, paving the way for scalable quantum simulation.
  The QCQ framework embodies a synergistic combination of quantum algorithms, machine learning, and Quantum-HPC capabilities, enhancing its potential to provide transformative insights into the behavior of quantum systems across different scales. As quantum hardware continues to improve, this hybrid distribution-aware framework will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of quantum computing by seamlessly integrating distributed quantum resources with the state-of-the-art classical computing infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Room temperature single-photon terahertz detection with thermal Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon terahertz (THz) detection is one of the most demanding technology for a variety of fields and could lead to many breakthroughs. Although its significant progress has been made in the last two decades, operating it at room temperature still remains a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, the room temperature THz detector at single-photon levels based on nonlinear wave mixing in thermal Rydberg atomic vapor. The low-energy THz photons are coherently upconverted to the high-energy optical photons via a nondegenerate Rydberg state involved six-wave-mixing process, and therefore, the single-photon THz detection is achieved by a conventional optical single-photon counting module. The noise equivalent power of such a detector is reached to be 9.5*10^-19 W/Hz^1/2, which is more than four orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art room temperature THz detectors. The optimum quantum efficiency of the whole wave-mixing process is about 4.3% with 40.6 dB dynamic range, and the maximum conversion bandwidth is 172 MHz, which is all-optically controllable. The developed fast and continuous-wave single-photon THz detector at room temperature operation has a great potential to be portable and chip-scale, and could be revolutionary for a wide range of applications in remote sensing, wireless communication, biomedical diagnostics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Variational Quantum Algorithm for the Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of many-body open quantum systems is key to solving numerous outstanding problems in physics, chemistry, material science, and in the development of quantum technologies. Near-term quantum computers may bring considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational Ans\"atze are proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model. The results underscore the algorithm's efficiency in simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems in the low-rank regime with limited quantum resources on a near-term quantum device.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Heisenberg Sensitivity with Sequential Weak Measurement Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a state preparation protocol based on sequential measurements of a central spin coupled with a spin ensemble, and investigate the usefulness of the generated multi-spin states for quantum enhanced metrology. Our protocol is shown to generate highly entangled spin states, devoid of the necessity for non-linear spin interactions. The metrological sensitivity of the resulting state surpasses the standard quantum limit, reaching the Heisenberg limit under symmetric coupling strength conditions. We also explore asymmetric coupling strengths, identifying specific preparation windows in time for optimal sensitivity. Our findings introduce a novel method for generating large-scale, non-classical, entangled states, enhancing quantum-enhanced metrology within current experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Operational Ergotropy: suboptimality of the geodesic drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forth a notion of optimality for extracting ergotropic work, derived from an energy constraint governing the necessary dynamics for work extraction in a quantum system. Within the traditional ergotropy framework, which predicts an infinite set of equivalent pacifying unitaries, we demonstrate that the optimal choice lies in driving along the geodesic connecting a given state to its corresponding passive state. Moreover, in a practical scenario where unitaries are inevitably affected by environmental factors, we refine the existing definition of ergotropy and introduce the notion of operational ergotropy. It enables the characterization of work extraction in noisy scenarios. We find that for certain typical noise models, the optimal choice which governs the Schrodinger part of the dynamics, aligns with the optimal drive in the unperturbed scenario. However, we demonstrate that such optimality is not universal by presenting an explicit counterexample. Additionally, within this generalized framework, we discuss the potential for faster work extraction from quantum systems in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Extracting Kinetic Information from Short-Time Trajectories: Relaxation and Disorder of Lossy Cavity Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of molecular cavity polaritons has stimulated a surge of experimental and theoretical activities and presents a unique opportunity to develop the many-body simulation methodology. This paper presents a numerical scheme for the extraction of key kinetic information of lossy cavity polaritons based on the transfer tensor method (TTM). Steady state, relaxation timescales and oscillatory phenomena can all be deduced directly from a set of transfer tensors without the need for long-time simulation. Moreover, we generalize TTM to disordered systems by sampling dynamical maps and achieve fast convergence to disordered-averaged dynamics using a small set of realizations. Together, these techniques provide a toolbox for characterizing the interplay of cavity loss, disorder, and cooperativity in polariton relaxation and allow us to predict unusual dependences on the initial excitation state, photon decay rate, strength of disorder, and the type of cavity models. Thus, we have demonstrated significant potential in the use of the TTM towards both the efficient computation of long-time polariton dynamics and the extraction of crucial kinetic information about polariton relaxation from a small set of short-time trajectories.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder Force between Nanoparticles and Graphene-Coated Silica Plate: Combined Effect of the Chemical Potential and Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir-Polder force between spherical nanoparticles and a graphene-coated silica plate is investigated in situations out of thermal equilibrium, i.e., with broken time-reversal symmetry. The response of graphene coating to the electromagnetic field is described on the basis of first principles of quantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature using the formalism of the polarization tensor in the framework of the Dirac model. The nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder force is calculated as a function of the mass-gap parameter, chemical potential of graphene and temperature of the graphene-coated plate, which can be both higher and lower than that of the environment. It is shown that the force value increases with increasing chemical potential, and this increase is more pronounced when the temperature of a graphene-coated plate is lower than that of the environment. The nonequilibrium force also increases with increasing temperature of the graphene-coated plate. This increase is larger when the plate is hotter than the environment. The effect is revealed that the combined impact of the chemical potential $\mu$ and mass gap $\Delta$ of graphene coating depends on the relationship between $\Delta$ and 2$\mu$. If $2\mu&gt;\Delta$ the magnitude of the nonequilibrium force between nanoparticles and a cooled graphene-coated plate becomes much larger than for a graphene coating with $\mu=0$. The physical reasons explaining this effect are elucidated. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-contact Casimir friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts the occurrence of random electromagnetic field fluctuations, or virtual photons, in vacuum. The exchange of virtual photons between two bodies in relative motion could lead to non-contact quantum vacuum friction or Casimir friction. Despite its theoretical significance, the non-contact Casimir frictional force has not been observed and its theoretical predictions have varied widely. In this work, we report the first measurement of the non-contact Casimir frictional force between two moving bodies. By employing two mechanical oscillators with resonant frequencies far lower than those in Lorentz models of electrons in dielectric materials, we have amplified the Casimir frictional force at low relative velocities by several orders of magnitude. We directly measure the non-contact Casimir frictional force between the two oscillators and show its linear dependence on velocity, proving the dissipative nature of Casimir friction. This advancement marks a pivotal contribution to the field of dissipative quantum electrodynamics and enhances our understanding of friction at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>On the mutual exclusiveness of time and position in quantum physics and the corresponding uncertainty relation for free falling particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of the characteristic properties of quantum theory, where it signals the incompatibility of two types of measurements. In this paper, we argue that measurements of time-of-arrival $T_x$ at position $x$ and position $X_t$ at time $t$ are mutually exclusive for a quantum system, each providing complementary information about the state of that system. For a quantum particle of mass $m$ falling in a uniform gravitational field $g$, we show that the corresponding uncertainty relation can be expressed as $\Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg}$. This uncertainty relationship can be taken as evidence of the presence of a form of epistemic incompatibility in the sense that preparing the initial state of the system so as to decrease the measured position uncertainty will lead to an increase in the measured time-of-arrival uncertainty. These findings can be empirically tested in the context of ongoing or forthcoming experiments on measurements of time-of-arrival for free-falling quantum particles.</description>

Abstract: In the last few years, much attention has been paid to exceptional surfaces (ESs) owing to various important physical phenomena and potential applications. However, high-order ESs in pseudo-Hermitian systems have not been reported until now. Here, we study the high-order ES in a pseudo-Hermitian superconducting (SC) circuit system. In our proposal, the SC circuit system is composed of three circularly coupled SC cavities, where the gain and loss are balanced. According to the eigenvalue properties of the pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive the general pseudo-Hermitian conditions for the ternary SC system. In the special pseudo-Hermitian case with parity-time symmetry, all third-order exceptional points (EP3s) of the SC system form a third-order exceptional line in the parameter space. Under the general pseudo-Hermitian conditions, more EP3s are found, and all EP3s are located on a surface, i.e., a third-order exceptional surface is constructed. Moreover, we also investigate the eigenvalues of the pseudo-Hermitian SC circuit around EP3s. Our work opens up a door for exploring high-order ESs and related applications in pseudo-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Single-piston quantum engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single-piston quantum engine based on a harmonic oscillator acting as the working fluid is proposed. Using the fact that the interaction between the piston and the oscillator depends on the extent of the oscillator wavefunction, one can control this interaction by modifying the oscillator temperature. By retracting the piston when the interaction is weak (hot oscillator) and returning it to the original position when the coupling is strong (cold oscillator), useful work can be performed assuming the interaction is attractive. The cycle of the engine is simulated numerically using two different powering protocols: bath and measurement. Using the collision model for the baths, the engine is shown to reach a steady state with positive work output.</description>

      <title>Analytical evaluation of the effect of deterministic control error on isolated quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of analog control errors which deterministically occurs on isolated quantum dynamics. Quantum information technologies require careful control for preparing a desired quantum state used as an information resource. However, in realistic experiment systems, it is difficult to implement the driving Hamiltonian without analog errors and the actual performance of quantum control is far away from the ideal one. Towards this problem, we derive a lower bound of the overlap between two isolated quantum systems obeying time evolution in the absence and presence of deterministic control errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the bound through some examples. Furthermore, by using this bound, we give an analytical estimate on the probability of obtaining the target state under any control errors.</description>

      <title>Characterization of hybrid quantum eigenstates in systems with mixed classical phasespace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems feature a structured, mixed classical phase-space. The traditional Percival classification of quantum spectra into regular states supported by quasi-integrable regions and irregular states supported by quasi-chaotic regions turns out to be insufficient to capture the richness of the Hilbert space. Berry's conjecture and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis are not applicable and quantum effects such as tunneling, scarring, and localization, do not obey the standard paradigms. We demonstrate these statements for a prototype Bose-Hubbard model. We highlight the hybridization of chaotic and regular regions from opposing perspectives of ergodicity and localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, inspired by neural networks, have become a novel approach in quantum computing. However, designing efficient parameterized quantum circuits remains a challenge. Quantum architecture search tackles this by adjusting circuit structures along with gate parameters to automatically discover high-performance circuit structures. In this study, we propose an end-to-end distributed quantum architecture search framework, where we aim to automatically design distributed quantum circuit structures for interconnected quantum processing units with specific qubit connectivity. We devise a circuit generation algorithm which incorporates TeleGate and TeleData methods to enable nonlocal gate implementation across quantum processing units. While taking into account qubit connectivity, we also incorporate qubit assignment from logical to physical qubits within our QAS framework. A two-stage progressive training-free strategy is employed to evaluate extensive circuit structures without circuit training costs. Through numerical experiments on three VQE tasks, the efficacy and efficiency of our scheme is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Imaginary gap-closed points and non-Hermitian dynamics in a class of dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate imaginary gap-closed (IGC) points and their associated dynamics in dissipative systems. In a general non-Hermitian model, we derive the equation governing the IGC points of the energy spectrum, establishing that these points are only determined by the Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. Focusing on a class of one-dimensional dissipative chains, we explore quantum walks across different scenarios and various parameters, showing that IGC points induce a power-law decay scaling in bulk loss probability and trigger a boundary phenomenon referred to as "edge burst". This observation underscores the crucial role of IGC points under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in shaping quantum walk dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that the damping matrices of these dissipative chains under PBCs possess Liouvillian gapless points, implying an algebraic convergence towards the steady state in long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Low Overhead Qutrit Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of $[9m-k, k, 2]_3$ triorthogonal codes, for $k\leq 3m-2$, for qutrit magic state distillation with low overhead. The overhead cost of a magic state distillation routine is characterized by the yield parameter $\gamma = \log_d \left( \frac{n}{k} \right)$. When $k=3m-2$, the codes have yield parameter $\gamma = \log_2 (2+\frac{6}{3 m-2})$, which tends to $1$ as $m \to \infty$. Moreover, the $[20,7,2]_3$ qutrit code that arises when $m=3$ already has a yield parameter of $1.51$ which outperforms all known qubit triorthogonal codes of size less than a few hundred qubits. We also find that the $[17,1,2]_3$ code distills magic states with a higher noise threshold than previously known qutrit triorthogonal codes.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as Consequence of Symmetry Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-relativistic Hamiltonian for an electron in the presence of an electromagnetic field, described using Landau's gauge, is solved analytically based on the conserved operators of the system: one for the canonical momentum in the $x$-axis, a second one for the canonical momentum in the $y$-axis, and the final one for the energy operator. It is shown that the Lorentz force can be recovered only if both of the conserved momenta are considered; otherwise, the system cannot be fully described. The wave function is calculated by solving an eigenvalue equation for the momentum operators, and a ground state of this function is then constructed. Based on the conserved properties of the system, a set of unitary operators defining the symmetries of the Hamiltonian is established. However, in Schr\"odinger's scheme, the necessary conditions for the invariance of the wave function after a unitary transformation give rise to a couple of quantized identities: one for the electric field and the second one for the magnetic field. Using the electric current expression defined by the continuity equation, the Hall and longitudinal resistivity were calculated, showing that the former is proportional to von Klitzing's constant and the latter vanishes when the time increment is $\Delta t&lt;&lt;\frac{m\omega_{c}}{q{\cal E}}\Delta x$. Finally, if the invariance condition is satisfied, then the Hall resistivity is quantized in integer multiples proportional to von Klitzing's constant. This implies that the fractional quantum Hall effect is a manifestation of symmetry invariance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of bosonic systems under monitored evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of non-interacting bosons in the presence of repeated projective measurements is studied. Following the established approach, this monitored evolution is characterized by the first detected return and the first detected transition probabilities. We show that these quantities are directly related to the entanglement entropy and to the entanglement spectrum of a bipartite system. Calculations with specific values for the number of bosons, the number of measurements and the time step between measurements reveal a sensitive and often strongly fluctuating entanglement entropy. In particular, we demonstrate that in the vicinity of special values for the time steps the evolution of the entanglement entropy is either stationary or performs dynamical switching between two or more stationary values. In the entanglement spectrum, on the other hand, this complex behavior can be associated with level crossings, indicating that the dominant quantum states and their entanglement respond strongly to a change of the system parameters. We discuss briefly the role of time averaging to remove the fluctuations of the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum physics is a linear theory, so it is somewhat puzzling that it can underlie very complex systems such as digital computers and life. This paper investigates how this is possible. Physically, such complex systems are necessarily modular hierarchical structures, with a number of key features. Firstly, they cannot be described by a single wave function: only local wave functions can exist, rather than a single wave function for a living cell, a cat, or a brain. Secondly, the quantum to classical transition is characterised by contextual wave-function collapse shaped by macroscopic elements that can be described classically. Thirdly, downward causation occurs in the physical hierarchy in two key ways: by the downward influence of time dependent constraints, and by creation, modification, or deletion of lower level elements. Fourthly, there are also logical modular hierarchical structures supported by the physical ones, such as algorithms and computer programs, They are able to support arbitrary logical operations, which can influence physical outcomes as in computer aided design and 3-d printing. Finally, complex systems are necessarily open systems, with heat baths playing a key role in their dynamics and providing local arrows of time that agree with the cosmological direction of time that is established by the evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Use of Nash equilibrium in finding game theoretic robust security bound on quantum bit error rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is employed to find a game theoretic robust security bound on quantum bit error rate (QBER) for DL04 protocol which is a scheme for quantum secure direct communication that has been experimentally realized recently. The receiver, sender, and eavesdropper (Eve) are considered to be quantum players (players having the capability to perform quantum operations). Specifically, Eve is considered to have the capability of performing quantum attacks (e.g., W\'ojcik's original attack, W\'ojcik's symmetrized attack, and Pavi\v{c}i\'c attack) and classical intercept and resend attack. Game theoretic analysis of the security of DL04 protocol in the above scenario is performed by considering several sub-game scenarios. The analysis revealed the absence of a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point within these sub-games. Consequently, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium points are identified and employed to establish both upper and lower bounds for QBER. Further, the vulnerability of the DL04 protocol to Pavi\v{c}i\'c attack in the message mode is established. In addition, it is observed that the quantum attacks performed by Eve are more powerful than the classical attack, as the QBER value and the probability of detecting Eve's presence are found to be lower in quantum attacks compared to classical ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an alternative to quantum error correction, quantum error mitigation methods, including Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), have been proposed to alleviate run-time errors in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we propose a modified version of ZNE that provides for a significant performance enhancement on current noisy devices. Our modified ZNE method extrapolates to zero-noise data by evaluating groups of noisy data obtained from noise-scaled circuits and selecting extrapolation functions for each group with the assistance of estimated noisy simulation results. To quantify enhancement in a real-world quantum application, we embed our modified ZNE in Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) - a memory system important for future quantum networks and computers. Our new ZNE-enhanced QRAM designs are experimentally implemented on a 27-qubit noisy superconducting quantum device, the results of which demonstrate that with reasonable estimated simulation results, QRAM fidelity is improved significantly relative to traditional ZNE usage. Our results demonstrate the critical role the extrapolation function plays in ZNE - judicious choice of that function on a per-measurement basis can make the difference between a quantum application being functional or non-functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have obtained explicit analytical formulas for the mean energy and its variance (characterizing the energy fluctuations) of a quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency in the adiabatic regimes after the frequency passes through zero. The behavior of energy turns out to be quite different in two cases: when the frequency remains real and when it becomes imaginary. In the first case, the mean energy always increases when the frequency returns to its initial value, and the increment coefficient is determined by the exponent in the power law of the frequency crossing zero. On the other hand, if the frequency becomes imaginary, the mean energy becomes equal to zero exactly, for all initial Fock states and for any value of the power law exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity is considered to provide a measure of the growth of operators evolving under Hamiltonian dynamics. The main strategy is the analysis of the structure of Krylov subspace $\mathcal{K}_M(\mathcal{H},\eta)$ spanned by the multiple applications of the Liouville operator $\mathcal{L}$ defined by the commutator in terms of a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathcal{L}:=[\mathcal{H},\cdot]$ acting on an operator $\eta$, $\mathcal{K}_M(\mathcal{H},\eta)=\text{span}\{\eta,\mathcal{L}\eta,\ldots,\mathcal{L}^{M-1}\eta\}$. For a given inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$ of the operators, the orthonormal basis $\{\mathcal{O}_n\}$ is constructed from $\mathcal{O}_0=\eta/\sqrt{(\eta,\eta)}$ by Lanczos algorithm. The moments $\mu_m=(\mathcal{O}_0,\mathcal{L}^m\mathcal{O}_0)$ are closely related to the important data $\{b_n\}$ called Lanczos coefficients. I present the exact and explicit expressions of the moments $\{\mu_m\}$ for 16 quantum mechanical systems which are {\em exactly solvable both in the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures}. The operator $\eta$ is the sinusoidal coordinate which is the variable of the eigenpolynomials $\{P_n(\eta)\}$ of the exactly solvable Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles of identical atoms exhibit peculiar collective properties in their interaction with radiation depending on geometry and environment where they are embedded in. A remarkably clean and versatile platform to study collective effects in resonant light scattering are M\"ossbauer nuclei placed in planar x-ray waveguides. Here we conceive and demonstrate experimentally distinct temporal emission characteristics in these systems, ranging from a tunable accelerated exponential decay all the way to a pronounced oscillatory emission pattern, depending on the waveguide geometry and mode of excitation. The observed temporal and spatial emission characteristics of the collectively excited nuclear state in the waveguide -- the nuclear exciton -- are well reproduced by a unified theoretical model. Our findings pave the way for applications ranging from fundamental studies of cooperative emission at hard x-ray frequencies up to new methods of narrowband x-ray control via the engineering of collective radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>Activation of entanglement in generalized entanglement swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement activation in a generalized entanglement swapping process involving two Bell pairs and generalized measurements. The conventional understanding posits entangled measurements as both necessary and sufficient for establishing entanglement between distant parties. In this study, we reassess the role of measurement operators in entanglement generation within a generalized entanglement swapping process. We focus on maximally entangled two-qubit initial states and generalized measurements, investigating the necessity and sufficiency conditions for entangled measurement operators. By utilizing two Bell pairs, (1, 2) shared between Alice and Bob, and (3, 4) shared between Bob and Charlie, we demonstrate that while entangled measurements are sufficient, they are not indispensable for establishing entanglement between spatially separated observers. Through a sequential approach, if Bob performs an initial measurement which is not able to establish entanglement then followed by another measurement after post-processing the first measurement it is possible to establish entanglement. We identify specific criteria for different measurement operators that enable the potential for performing a second measurement to establish entanglement. Our findings highlight the feasibility of generating entanglement between distant parties through a combination of measurements, shedding new light on entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Additionally, we showcase through illustrative examples how successive measurements enhance entanglement compared to single measurements, underscoring the practical benefits of our approach in enhancing entanglement. Moreover, our protocol extends beyond bipartite qubit states to higher-dimensional maximally entangled states, emphasizing its versatility and applicability.</description>

      <title>Confinement of $N$-body systems and non-integer dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The squeezing process of a three-dimensional quantum system by use of an external deformed one-body oscillator potential can also be described by the $d$-method, without external field and where the dimension can take non-integer values. In this work we first generalize both methods to $N$ particles and any transition between dimensions below $3$. Once this is done, the use of harmonic oscillator interactions between the particles allows complete analytic solutions of both methods, and a direct comparison between them is possible. Assuming that both methods describe the same process, leading to the same ground state energy and wave function, an analytic equivalence between the methods arises. The equivalence between both methods and the validity of the derived analytic relation between them is first tested for two identical bosons and for squeezing transitions from 3 to 2 and 1 dimensions, as well as from 2 to 1 dimension. We also investigate the symmetric squeezing from 3 to 1 dimensions of a system made of three identical bosons. We have in all the cases found that the derived analytic relations between the two methods work very well. This fact permits to relate both methods also for large squeezing scenarios, where the brute force numerical calculation with the external field is too much demanding from the numerical point of view, especially for systems with more than two particles.</description>

Abstract: A topological phase can undergo a phase transition driven by anyon condensation. A potential obstruction to such a mechanism could arise if there exists a symmetry between anyons that have non-trivial mutual statistics. Here we consider toric code subjected to errors that tend to proliferate anyons with non-trivial mutual statistics. Using triangle inequality, we show that in the presence of electromagnetic duality and a partial-transpose symmetry, a decoherence induced phase transition out of the topological phase must be rather unconventional and lie beyond standard rules of anyon condensation. To explore such physics, we first subject toric code to a self-dual quantum channel where Kraus operators are proportional to X+Z. We find that the topological phase is stable up to the maximal error rate, when viewing density matrix as a pure state in the double Hilbert space. To access an unconventional transition, we then consider a perturbed toric code subjected to the self-dual channel, and find numerical evidence that beyond a critical error rate, the topological phase is destroyed resulting in a critical phase where anyons are only power-law condensed.</description>

      <title>Strict hierarchy of optimal strategies for global estimations: Mapping global estimations into local ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial yet challenging issue in quantum metrology is to ascertain the ultimate precision achievable in estimation strategies. While there are two paradigms of estimations, local and global, current research is largely confined to local estimations, which are useful once the parameter of interest is approximately known. In this Letter we target at a paradigm shift towards global estimations, which can operate reliably even with a few measurement data and no substantial prior knowledge about the parameter. The key innovation here is to develop a technique, dubbed virtual imaginary time evolution, capable of mapping global estimations into local ones. This offers an intriguing pathway to surmount challenges in the realm of global estimations by leveraging powerful tools tailored for local estimations. We explore our technique to unveil a strict hierarchy of achievable precision for different global estimation strategies, including parallel, sequential, and indefinite-causal-order strategies.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in Krylov Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermalization for closed non-integrable quantum systems in the Krylov basis. Following the idea of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, one may introduce Krylov basis thermalization hypothesis which imposes a condition on the matrix elements of local operators in the Krylov basis. In this context, the nature of thermalization may be probed by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. We also compute the variance of Lanczos coefficients which may provide another quantity to examine the nature of thermalization. We will see that there is a direct relation between the behavior of the infinite time average of complexity and that of the inverse participation ratio of initial states.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of universal quantum gates and six-qubit state using photonic quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled quantum walk forms the basis for various quantum algorithm and quantum simulation schemes. Though theoretical proposals are also available to realize universal quantum computation using quantum walks, no experimental demonstration of universal set of gates has been reported. Here we report the experimental realize of universal set of quantum gates using photonic quantum walk. Taking cue from the discrete-time quantum walk formalism, we encode multiple qubits using polarization and paths degree of freedom for photon and demonstrate realization of universal set of gates with 100\% success probability and high fidelity, as characterised by quantum state tomography. For a 3-qubit system we encode first qubit with $H$ and $V-$polarization of photon and path information for the second and third qubit, closely resembling a Mach-Zehnder interference setup. To generate a 6-qubit system and demonstrate 6-qubit GHZ state, entangled photon pairs are used as source to two 3-qubit systems. We also provide insights into the mapping of quantum circuits to quantum walk operations on photons and way to resourcefully scale. This work marks a significant progress towards using photonic quantum walk for quantum computing. It also provides a framework for photonic quantum computing using lesser number of photons in combination with path degree of freedom to increase the success rate of multi-qubit gate operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we engineer the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction mediated by photons to emulate ground-state chiral current based on three-level atoms driven by quantum and classical fields. We employ adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction Hamiltonian of two-level systems, which can address the challenges arising from the finite lifetime of excited states. Furthermore, we can ensure to achieve desired dynamics through the implementation of periodic modulation on the atomic ground states. Besides, three-state and multi-state chiral current can be obtained by choosing appropriate driving frequencies and phases. We also design the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for the other components based on a toggling frame. The numerical simulation results further indicate that our proposal can generate a perfectly reliable ground-state chiral current and open up possibilities for quantum state transfer and the development of future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Solving Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems in the Wool Textile Industry with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production site to a multi-factory production environment that must handle both geographically dispersed production orders and their multi-site production steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) to Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). As a result, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. In our work, we use Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP. In addition to the assignment of production orders to production sites, the assignment of production steps to production sites also takes place. This requirement is based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturer. To investigate the applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from 50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated and solved. Special attention is dedicated to the determination of the Lagrange parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem instances specific to the industry.</description>

      <title>On the construction of a quantum channel corresponding to non-commutative graph for a qubit interacting with quantum oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider error correction, based on the theory of non-commutative graphs, for a model of a qubit interacting with quantum oscillator. The dynamics of the composite system is governed by the Schr\"odinger equation which generates positive operator-valued measure (POVM) for the system dynamics. We construct a quantum channel generating the non-commutative graph as a linear envelope of the POVM. The idea is based on applying a generalized version of a quantum channel using the apparatus of von Neumann algebras. The results are analyzes for a non-commutative graph generated by a qubit interacting with quantum oscillator. For this model the quantum anticlique which determines the error correcting subspace has an explicit expression.</description>

      <title>Fast classical simulation of quantum circuits via parametric rewriting in the ZX-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ZX-calculus is an algebraic formalism that allows quantum computations to be simplified via a small number of simple graphical rewrite rules. Recently, it was shown that, when combined with a family of "sum-over-Cliffords" techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classical simulation of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks, such as computing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes of a single quantum circuit, this technique results in reductions over many very similar diagrams, where much of the same computational work is repeated. In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be shared across branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on diagrams with boolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed after the bulk of the simplification work is already done, we show that it is possible to perform the final stage of classical simulation quickly utilising a high degree of GPU parallelism. Using these methods, we demonstrate speedups upwards of 100x for certain classical simulation tasks vs. the non-parametric approach.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Correlated Noise in Quantum Computers via Context-Aware Compiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent errors, and especially those that occur in correlation among a set of qubits, are detrimental for large-scale quantum computing. Correlations in noise can occur as a result of spatial and temporal configurations of instructions executing on the quantum processor. In this paper, we perform a detailed experimental characterization of many of these error sources, and theoretically connect them to the physics of superconducting qubits and gate operations. Equipped with this knowledge, we devise compiler strategies to suppress these errors using dynamical decoupling or error compensation into the rest of the circuit. Importantly, these strategies are successful when the context at each layer of computation is taken into account: how qubits are connected, what crosstalk terms exist on the device, and what gates or idle periods occur in that layer. Our context-aware compiler thus suppresses some dominant sources of error, making further error mitigation or error correction substantially less expensive. For example, our experiments show an increase of 18.5\% in layer fidelity for a candidate 10-qubit circuit layer compared to context-unaware suppression. Owing to the exponential nature of error mitigation, these improvements due to error suppression translate to several orders of magnitude reduction of sampling overhead for a circuit consisting of a moderate number of layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton condensates occur away from thermal equilibrium, in an open system where heat and particles are continually exchanged with reservoirs. These phenomena have been extensively analyzed in terms of kinetic equations. Based on the collection of knowledge about polariton kinetics provided by these simulations and by experimental works, we constructed a few-level model that captures the main processes involved in the buildup of a ground-state population of polaritons. This allows condensation to be understood as the output of a heat engine and exposes the thermodynamic constraints on its occurrence. The model consists of a three-level system interacting with a field and connected to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir that represent a non-resonant pump and the lattice phonons. This subsystem can drive a condensate, through polariton-polariton scattering, which produces work in the form of coherent light emission from the microcavity. We obtain a phase diagram as a function of the temperatures of the two baths and investigate the possible types of phase transition that lead to the condensate phase.</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Tensor Networks for Protein Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that protein sequences can be thought of as sentences in natural language processing and can be parsed using the existing Quantum Natural Language framework into parameterized quantum circuits of reasonable qubits, which can be trained to solve various protein-related machine-learning problems. We classify proteins based on their subcellular locations, a pivotal task in bioinformatics that is key to understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. Leveraging the quantum-enhanced processing capabilities, we demonstrate that Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) can effectively handle the complexity and diversity of protein sequences. We present a detailed methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration, whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multi-qubit quantum gates intrinsic to a general array of semiconductor quantum dots and investigate how they can be implemented in a scalable way. The intrinsic quantum gates refer to the class of natural-forming transformations in the qubit rotating-frame under direct exchange coupling, and can be recognized as the instruction set of a spin-qubit chip. Adopting an perturbative treatment, we can model intrinsic gates by first-order dynamics in the coupling strength. A general formalism is developed for identifying the multi-qubit intrinsic gates under arbitrary array connectivity. Factors influencing the fidelities of the multi-qubit intrinsic gates are discussed. The advantageous applications of intrinsic gates in quantum computing and quantum error correction are explored. We also propose a theoretical scheme to overcome the problem of inhomogeneous coupling using dynamical calibration of the connecting bonds. This scheme can be further combined with periodic dynamical decoupling for robust implementations of multi-qubit gates in large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contextual fraction introduced by Abramsky and Brandenburger defines a quantitative measure of contextuality associated with empirical models, i.e. tables of probabilities of measurement outcomes in experimental scenarios. In this paper we define a measure of entanglement relying on the contextual fraction. We first show that any separable state is necessarily non-contextual, regardless of the measurement scenario. Then, for bipartite states we associate a distinguished empirical model and show that the corresponding contextual fraction is positively correlated with the entanglement entropy of the state, suggesting that contextuality may be regarded as a refinement of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Biphoton State Reconstruction via Phase Retrieval Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete measurement of the quantum state of two correlated photons requires reconstructing the amplitude and phase of the biphoton wavefunction. We show how, by means of spatially resolved single photon detection, one can infer the spatial structure of bi-photons generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion. In particular, a spatially resolved analysis of the second-order correlations allows us to isolate the moduli of the pump and phasematching contributions to the two-photon states. When carrying this analysis on different propagation planes, the free space propagation of pump and phasematching is observed. This result allows, in principle, to gain enough information to reconstruct also the phase of pump and phasematching, and thus the full biphoton wavefunction. We show this in different examples where the pump is shaped as a superposition of orbital angular momentum modes or as a smooth amplitude with a phase structure with no singularities. The corresponding phase structure is retrieved employing maximum likelihood or genetic algorithms. These findings have potential applications in fast, efficient quantum state characterisation that does not require any control over the source.</description>

      <title>A unified diagrammatic approach in Liouville space to quantum transport for bosonic and fermionic reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a diagrammatic approach to quantum transport based on a master equation formalism in Liouville space. It can be applied to linear and nonlinear transport in generic multi-level junctions coupled to bosonic or fermionic reservoirs and presents a convenient perturbation expansion in the strength of the coupling between the reservoirs and the junction. The Redfield theory is recovered at second order, with the partial and full secular master equations discussed. Analytical, approximate expressions are provided up to fourth order for the steady-state boson transport that generalize to multi-level systems the known formula for the low-temperature thermal conductance in the spin-boson model. The formalism is applied to the problem of heat transport in a qubit-resonator junction modeled by the quantum Rabi model. Nontrivial transport features emerge as a result of the interplay between the qubit-oscillator detuning and coupling strength. For quasi-degenerate spectra, nonvanishing steady-state coherences cause a suppression of the thermal conductance.</description>

      <title>Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist quantum geometric tensor of finite-temperature mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reveals local geometric properties and associated topological information of quantum states. Here a generalization of the QGT to mixed quantum states at finite temperatures based on the Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist distance is developed. The resulting Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist QGT is invariant under gauge transformations of individual spectrum levels. A Pythagorean-like relation connects the distances and gauge transformations, which clarifies the role of the parallel-transport condition. The real part of the QGT naturally decomposes into a sum of the Fisher-Rao metric and Fubini-Study metrics, allowing a distinction between different contributions to the quantum distance. The imaginary part of the QGT is proportional to the weighted summation of the Berry curvatures, which leads to a geometric phase for mixed states under certain conditions. We present three examples of different dimensions to illustrate the temperature dependence of the QGT and a discussion on possible implications.</description>

Abstract: Isotropic but otherwise largely arbitrary Heisenberg models in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field are considered, including various integrable, non-integrable, as well as disordered examples, and not necessarily restricted to one dimension or short-range interactions. Taking for granted that the non-equilibrium initial condition and the spectrum of the field-free model satisfy some very weak requirements, expectation values of generic observables are analytically shown to exhibit permanent long-time oscillations, thus ruling out equilibration. If the model (but not necessarily the initial condition) is translationally invariant, the long-time oscillations are moreover shown to exhibit synchronization in the long run, meaning that they are invariant under arbitrary translations of the observable. Analogous long-time oscillations are also recovered for temporal correlation functions when the system is already at thermal equilibrium from the outset, thus realizing a so-called time crystal.</description>

      <title>On the quantum Guerra-Morato Action Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth potential $W:\mathrm{T}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ on the torus, the Quantum Guerra-Morato action functional is given by \smallskip
  $ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, I(\psi) = \int\,(\, \, \,\frac{D v\, D v^*}{2}(x) - W(x) \,) \,\,a(x)^2 dx,$ \smallskip
  \noindent where $\psi $ is described by $\psi = a\, e^{i\,\frac{ u }{h}} $, $ u =\, \frac{v + v^*}{2},$ $a=e^{\,\frac{v^*\,-\,v}{2\, \hbar} }$, $v,v ^*$ are real functions, $\int a^2 (x) d x =1$, and $D$ is derivative on $x \in \mathrm{T}^{n}$. It is natural to consider the constraint $ \mathrm{d}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{v}(a^{2}Du)=0$, which means flux zero. The $a$ and $u$ obtained from a critical solution (under variations $\tau$) for such action functional, fulfilling such constraints, satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a quantum potential. Denote $'=\frac{d}{d\tau}$. We show that the expression for the second variation of a critical solution is given by
  \smallskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\int a^{2}\,D[ v' ]\, D [(v ^*)']\, dx.$
  \smallskip
  Introducing the constraint $\int a^2 \,D u \,dx =V$, we also consider later an associated dual eigenvalue problem. From this follows a transport and a kind of eikonal equation.</description>

      <title>On the importance of experimental details: A Comment on "Non-Polaritonic Effects in Cavity-Modified Photochemistry"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an article by the Barnes group reported on the experimental study of a photoisomerization reaction inside an optical cavity, claiming to reproduce previous results by Hutchison et al. and making the point that in such setups, changes in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the molecules in the cavity can lead to modifications in the photochemical reaction rate. While Hutchison et al. associated such modifications with the emergence of strong light-matter coupling, in their attempt to re-examine these experiments, Barnes et al. did not find any evidence that strong coupling needs to be invoked to explain the observed effects. In response to this publication, we herein highlight the main differences between the two experimental studies, and explain why the results of Barnes et al. are irrelevant to the former study and have no bearing on its conclusions. Specifically, we show that under the experimental conditions used by Hutchison et al. such intensity-modification effects are negligible and can therefore be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Implementation and characterization of the dice lattice in the electron quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials featuring touching points, localized states, and flat bands are of great interest in condensed matter and artificial systems due to their implications in topology, quantum geometry, superconductivity, and interactions. In this theoretical study, we propose the experimental realization of the dice lattice with adjustable parameters by arranging carbon monoxide molecules on a two-dimensional electron system at a (111) copper surface. First, we develop a theoretical framework to obtain the spectral properties within a nearly free electron approximation and then compare them with tight-binding calculations. Our investigation reveals that the high mobility of Shockley state electrons enables an accurate theoretical description of the artificial lattice using a next-nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, resulting in the emergence of a touching point, a quasi-flat band, and localized lattice site behavior in the local density of states. Additionally, we present theoretical results for a long-wavelength low-energy model that accounts for next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms. Furthermore, we theoretically examine the model's behavior under an external magnetic field by employing Peierl's substitution, a commonly used technique in theoretical physics to incorporate magnetic fields into lattice models. Our theoretical findings suggest that, owing to the exceptional electron mobility, the highly degenerate eigenenergy associated with the Aharonov-Bohm caging mechanism may not manifest in the proposed experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the analogue gravity model within the context of f(R,T) gravity applied to graphene. The derivation of the Lagrangian density in two dimensions (2D) is undertaken, accounting for the altered gravitational effects as characterized by the function f(R,T). The Lagrangian encompasses the quasiparticle field $\psi(x)$, its adjoint $\overline{\psi}$, the effective metric tensor $g^{\mu\nu}$, and the gauge field $A_{\nu}$. The equations of motion are established through variational principles applied to the Lagrangian, resulting in modified Dirac equations. We discuss the interpretation of the additional terms in the equations of motion and their significance in capturing the modified gravitational dynamics in the graphene system. Our findings contribute to the understanding of analogue gravity models and their applications in condensed matter systems.</description>

Abstract: For an $n$-qubit system, a rational function on the space of mixed states which is invariant with respect to the action of the group of local symmetries may be viewed as a detailed measure of entanglement. We show that the field of all such invariant rational functions is purely transcendental over the complex numbers and has transcendence degree $4^n - 2n-1$. An explicit transcendence basis is also exhibited.</description>

      <title>MP2-based composite extrapolation schemes can predict core-ionization energies for first-row elements with coupled-cluster level accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measures core-electron binding energies (CEBEs) to reveal element-specific insights into chemical environment and bonding. Accurate theoretical CEBE prediction aids XPS interpretation but requires proper modeling of orbital relaxation and electron correlation upon core-ionization. This work systematically investigates basis set selection for extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit of CEBEs from $\Delta$MP2 and $\Delta$CC energies across 94 K-edges in diverse organic molecules. We demonstrate that an alternative composite scheme using $\Delta$MP2 in a large basis corrected by $\Delta$CC-$\Delta$MP2 difference in a small basis can quantitatively recover optimally extrapolated $\Delta$CC CEBEs within 0.02 eV. Unlike $\Delta$CC, MP2 calculations do not suffer from convergence issues and are computationally cheaper, and, thus, the composite $\Delta$MP2/$\Delta$CC scheme balances accuracy and cost, overcoming limitations of solely using either method. We conclude by providing a comprehensive analysis of the choice of small and large basis sets for the composite schemes and provide practical recommendations for highly accurate (within 0.10-0.15 eV MAE) ab initio prediction of XPS spectra.</description>

Abstract: Thouless charge pumps are quantum mechanical devices whose operation relies on topology. They provide the means for transporting quantum matter in space lattices with a single quantum precision. Contrasting space crystals that spontaneously break a continuous spatial translation symmetry and form crystals in space,time crystals have emerged as novel states of matter that organize into time lattices and spontaneously break a discrete time translation symmetry. The utility of Thouless pumps that enable topologically protected quantised transport of electrons and neutral atoms in spatial superlattices leads to the question if corresponding devices exist for time crystals? Here we show that topological pumps can be realized for time solids by transporting droplets of a liquid forward and backward in time lattices and we measure the topological index that characterises such pumping processes. By exploiting a synthetic time dimension classical time crystals can circumvent the quantum tunneling that underpins Thouless charge pumps. Our results establish topological pumping through time instead of space and pave the way for applications of time crystals.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the entanglement in a diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dot, crucial for quantum technologies. Despite their potential, these systems exhibit low extraction rates. We explore self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots, focusing on entanglement between them based on spin states. Our analysis involves defining wavefunctions, employing density matrix operators, and measuring entanglement entropy. Numerical assessments reveal few promising pairs among various quantum dot combinations that exhibit significant entanglement. Additionally, this work discusses theoretical developments and statistical evaluations of entanglement in diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dots, providing insights into their potential for quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To harness the potential of radially polarized single photons in applications such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) and quantum communication, we demonstrate an on-chip, room-temperature device, which generates highly directional radially polarized photons at very high rates. The photons are emitted from a giant CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dot (gQD) accurately positioned at the tip of a metal nanocone centered inside a hybrid metal-dielectric bullseye antenna. We show that due to the large and selective Purcell enhancement specifically for the out-of-plane optical dipole of the gQD, the emitted photons can have a very high degree of radial polarization (&gt;93%), based on a quantitative metric. Our study emphasizes the importance of accurate gQD positioning for optimal radial polarization purity through extensive experiments and simulations, which contribute to the fundamental understanding of radial polarization in nanostructured devices and pave the way for implementation of such systems in practical applications using structured quantum light.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Quantum Indeterminacy</title>

Abstract: Recent philosophical discussions about metaphysical indeterminacy have been substantiated with the idea that quantum mechanics, one of the most successful physical theories in the history of science, provides explicit instances of worldly indefiniteness. Against this background, several philosophers underline that there are alternative formulations of quantum theory in which such indeterminacy has no room and plays no role. A typical example is Bohmian mechanics in virtue of its clear particle ontology. Contrary to these latter claims, this paper aims at showing that different pilot-wave theories do in fact instantiate diverse forms of metaphysical indeterminacy. Namely, I argue that there are various questions about worldly states of affairs that cannot be determined by looking exclusively at their ontologies and dynamical laws. Moreover, it will be claimed that Bohmian mechanics generates a new form of modal indeterminacy. Finally, it will be concluded that ontological clarity and indeterminacy are not mutually exclusive, i.e., the two can coexist in the same theory.</description>

      <title>Bond-Order Density Wave Phases in Dimerized Extended Bose-Hubbard Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) has been widely explored to develop a profound understanding of the strongly correlated behavior of interacting bosons. Quantum simulators not only allow the exploration of the BHM but also extend it to models with interesting phenomena such as gapped phases with multiple orders and topological phases. In this work, an extended Bose-Hubbard model involving a dimerized one-dimensional model of long-range interacting hard-core bosons is studied. Bond-order density wave phases (BODW) are characterized in terms of their symmetry breaking and topological properties. At certain fillings, interactions combined with dimerized hoppings give rise to an emergent symmetry-breaking leading to BODW phases, which differs from the case of non-interacting models that require an explicit breaking of the symmetry. Specifically, the BODW phase at filling $\rho=1/3$ possesses no analogue in the non-interacting model in terms of its symmetry-breaking properties and the unit cell structure. Upon changing the dimerization pattern, the system realizes topologically trivial BODW phases. At filling $\rho=1/4$, on-site density modulations are shown to stabilize the topological BODW phase. Our work provides the bridge between interacting and non-interacting BODW phases and highlights the significance of long-range interactions in a dimerized lattice by showing unique BODW phases that do not exist in the non-interacting model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$ microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that in the canonical ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) setups are delineated.</description>

Abstract: We put forward a concrete experimental setup allowing to measure light-by-light scattering in the collision of two optical high-intensity laser beams at state-of-the-art high-field facilities operating petawatt class laser systems. Our setup uses the same focusing optics for both laser beams to be collided and employs a dark-field approach for the detection of the single-photon-level nonlinear quantum vacuum response in the presence of a large background. Based on an advanced modeling of the colliding laser fields, we in particular provide reliable estimates for the prospective numbers of signal photons scattered into the dark-field for various laser polarizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model at weak interaction with the heat baths is controlled by the qubit-oscillator coupling. Universality of the linear conductance versus the temperature is found for $T\lesssim T_K$, with $T_K$ a coupling-dependent Kondo-like temperature. At low temperature, coherent heat transfer via virtual processes yields a $\sim T^3$ behavior with destructive interference in the presence of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum. As the temperature increases, incoherent emission and absorption dominate and a maximum is reached at $T\sim T_K/2$. In the presence of a bias on the qubit, the conductance makes a transition from a resonant to a broad, zero-bias peak regime. Parallels and differences are found compared to the spin-boson model in [K. Saito and T. Kato, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 214301 (2013)], where the qubit-bath coupling instead of the internal qubit-oscillator coupling rules thermal transport.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances have led towards first prototypes of quantum networks in which entanglement is distributed by sources producing bipartite entangled states. This raises the question of which states can be generated in quantum networks based on bipartite sources using local operations and classical communication. In this work, we study state transformations under finite rounds of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) in networks based on maximally entangled two-qubit states. We first derive the symmetries for arbitrary network structures, as these determine which transformations are possible. Then, we show that contrary to tree graphs, for which it has already been shown that any state within the same entanglement class can be reached, there exist states which can be reached probabilistically but not deterministically if the network contains a cycle. Furthermore, we provide a systematic way to determine states which are not reachable in networks consisting of a cycle. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of the states which can be reached in a cycle network with a protocol where each party measures only once, and each step of the protocol results in a deterministic transformation. Finally, we present an example which cannot be reached with such a simple protocol, and constitutes, up to our knowledge, the first example of a LOCC transformation among fully entangled states requiring three rounds of classical communication.</description>

      <title>On Certified Randomness from Fourier Sampling or Random Circuit Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certified randomness has a long history in quantum information, with many potential applications. Recently Aaronson (2018, 2020) proposed a novel public certified randomness protocol based on existing random circuit sampling (RCS) experiments. The security of his protocol, however, relies on non-standard complexity-theoretic conjectures which were not previously studied in the literature.
  Inspired by Aaronson's work, we study certified randomness in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). We show that quantum Fourier Sampling can be used to define a publicly verifiable certified randomness protocol, with unconditional black-box security. In addition to giving a certified randomness protocol in the QROM, our work can also be seen as supporting Aaronson's conjectures for RCS-based randomness generation, as our protocol is in some sense the "black-box version" of Aaronson's protocol. In further support of Aaronson's proposal, we prove a Fourier Sampling version of Aaronson's conjecture by extending Raz and Tal's separation of BQP vs PH.
  Our work complements the subsequent certified randomness protocol of Yamakawa and Zhandry (2022) in the QROM. Whereas the security of that protocol relied on the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture, our protocol is unconditionally secure - at the expense of requiring exponential-time classical verification. Our protocol also has a simple heuristic implementation.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity state transfer via quantum walks from delocalized states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the state transfer through quantum walks placed on a bounded one-dimensional path. We first consider continuous-time quantum walks from a Gaussian state. We find such a state when superposing centered on the starting and antipodal positions preserves a high fidelity for a long time and when sent on large circular graphs. Furthermore, it spreads with a null group velocity. We also explore discrete-time quantum walks to evaluate the qubit fidelity throughout the walk. In this case, the initial state is a product of states between a qubit and a Gaussian superposition of position states. Then, we add two $\sigma_x$ gates to confine this delocalized qubit. We also find that this bounded system dynamically enables periodic recovery of the initial separable state. We outline some applications of our results in dynamic graphs and propose quantum circuits to implement them based on the available literature.</description>

      <title>A simplified M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate for the trapped ion quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how to simplify the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) gate which is used for the trapped ion quantum computer. The original MS gate is implemented by illuminating two ions with bichromatic coherent light fields separately at the same time. In this paper, we propose a method for transforming a separable state of two ions into one of the Bell states by illuminating the two ions with monochromatic coherent light fields individually and this point is the advantage of our scheme over the original MS gate. The length of the execution time of our proposed gate is comparable to that of the original MS gate, however, numerical calculations show that our proposed gate is weakly sensitive to thermal fluctuations of the phonons. By giving another example of a simple two-ion gate that can generate entanglement but is strongly vulnerable to thermal fluctuations, we show that our simplified MS gate is more marked than usual.</description>

      <title>Quantum Event Learning and Gentle Random Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the expected disturbance caused to a quantum system by a sequence of randomly ordered two-outcome projective measurements is upper bounded by the square root of the probability that at least one measurement in the sequence accepts. We call this bound the Gentle Random Measurement Lemma.
  We then consider problems in which we are given sample access to an unknown state $\rho$ and asked to estimate properties of the accepting probabilities $\text{Tr}[M_i \rho]$ of a set of measurements $\{M_1, M_2, \ldots , M_m\}$. We call these types of problems Quantum Event Learning Problems. Using the gentle random measurement lemma, we show randomly ordering projective measurements solves the Quantum OR problem, answering an open question of Aaronson. We also give a Quantum OR protocol which works on non-projective measurements but which requires a more complicated type of measurement, which we call a Blended Measurement. Given additional guarantees on the set of measurements $\{M_1, \ldots, M_m\}$, we show the Quantum OR protocols developed in this paper can also be used to find a measurement $M_i$ such that $\text{Tr}[M_i \rho]$ is large. We also give a blended measurement based protocol for estimating the average accepting probability of a set of measurements on an unknown state.
  Finally we consider the Threshold Search Problem described by O'Donnell and B\u{a}descu. By building on our Quantum Event Finding result we show that randomly ordered (or blended) measurements can be used to solve this problem using $O(\log^2(m) / \epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$. Consequently, we obtain an algorithm for Shadow Tomography which requires $\tilde{O}(\log^2(m)\log(d)/\epsilon^4)$ samples, matching the current best known sample complexity. This algorithm does not require injected noise in the quantum measurements, but does require measurements to be made in a random order and so is no longer online.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transition of Operator Size Growth in Quantum Systems Embedded in an Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In closed generic many-body systems, unitary evolution disperses local quantum information into highly non-local objects, resulting in thermalization. Such a process is called information scrambling, whose swiftness is quantified by the operator size growth. However, for quantum systems embedded in an environment, how the couplings to the environment affect the process of information scrambling quests revelation. Here we predict a dynamical transition in quantum systems with all-to-all interactions accompanied by an environment, which separates two phases. In the dissipative phase, information scrambling halts as the operator size decays with time, while in the scrambling phase, dispersion of information persists and the operator size grows and saturates to an $O(N)$ value in the long-time limit with $N$ the number of degrees of freedom of the systems. The transition is driven by the competition between the system intrinsic and environment propelled scramblings and the environment induced dissipation. Our prediction is derived from a general argument based on epidemiological models and demonstrated analytically via solvable Brownian SYK models. We provide further evidence which suggests that the transition is generic to quantum chaotic systems when coupled to an environment. Our study sheds light on the fundamental behavior of quantum systems in the presence of an environment.</description>

      <title>Even shorter quantum circuit for phase estimation on early fault-tolerant quantum computers with applications to ground-state energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a phase estimation method with a distinct feature: its maximal runtime (which determines the circuit depth) is $\delta/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target precision, and the preconstant $\delta$ can be arbitrarily close to $0$ as the initial state approaches the target eigenstate. The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$. As a result, our algorithm may significantly reduce the circuit depth for performing phase estimation tasks on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. The key technique is a simple subroutine called quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our algorithm can be readily applied to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the initial state and the ground state is large. If this initial overlap is small, we can combine our method with the Fourier filtering method developed in [Lin, Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022], and the resulting algorithm provably reduces the circuit depth in the presence of a large relative overlap compared to $\epsilon$. The relative overlap condition is similar to a spectral gap assumption, but it is aware of the information in the initial state and is therefore applicable to certain Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We observe that the circuit depth can be reduced by around two orders of magnitude in numerical experiments under various settings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle for Entangled States of Two Identical Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we determine the consequences of the quantum entanglement of a system of two identical particles when the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is considered. GUP is usually associated with the existence of a minimal length. We focus on the main formulations of the GUP and then we determine the minimal uncertainties in position induced by those modified GUP's. Our results point out that the minimal uncertainty is reduced by half of its usual value independently of the GUP employed. This implies that the minimal length is also reduced by half. On the other hand, it is generally expected that the minimal length must not depend on physical system. We overcome this apparent paradox by realizing that the entangled system is composed by two particles so that an effective parameter related to the minimal length must be employed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an ultrahigh-efficiency, broadband and multi-channel all-optical switching scheme based on broadband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) in a linear and nonlinear regimes in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) system. Two separate atomic transitions are excited simultaneously by two signal fields coupled from two ends of an optical cavity under the collective strong coupling condition. Three polariton eigenstates are produced which can be tuned freely by varying system parameters. The output field intensities of multiple channels are zero when the CPA criterion is satisfied. However, destructive quantum interference can be induced by a free-space weak control laser tuned to the multi-polariton excitation. As a consequence, the CQED system acts as a coherent perfect light absorber/transmitter as the control field is turned on/off the polariton resonances. In particular, the proposed scheme may be used to realize broadband multi-throw all-optical switching in the nonlinear excitation regime. The proposed scheme is useful for constructing all-optical routing, all-optical communication networks and various quantum logic elements.</description>

Abstract: A tunable optical multistability scheme based on a single cavity mode coupled with two separate atomic transitions in an atom-cavity system is proposed and demonstrated. Under the collective strong coupling condition, multiple polariton eigenstates of the atom-cavity system are produced. The threshold and optical multistability curve can be tuned freely by system parameters in a broadband range. Moreover, a certain bistability region of the system is split to two bistability regions due to destructive quantum interference induced by an extra weak control field. Compared to traditional optical multistabilities created by two or more light fields, the proposed optical multistability scheme has compactness and is easy to be miniaturized. The proposed scheme is useful for manufacturing integrated application of multi-state all-optical logic devices and constructing basic elements of all-optical communication networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous and computationally hard to solve in general. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the most representative quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems by transforming the discrete optimization problem into a classical optimization problem over continuous circuit parameters. QAOA objective landscape is notorious for pervasive local minima, and its viability significantly relies on the efficacy of the classical optimizer. In this work, we design double adaptive-region Bayesian optimization (DARBO) for QAOA. Our numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm greatly outperforms conventional optimizers in terms of speed, accuracy, and stability. We also address the issues of measurement efficiency and the suppression of quantum noise by conducting the full optimization loop on a superconducting quantum processor as a proof of concept. This work helps to unlock the full power of QAOA and paves the way toward achieving quantum advantage in practical classical tasks.</description>

      <title>Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Theory and the Koopman-van Hove Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase space Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation can be derived from the asymptotic semiclassical analysis of partial differential equations. Semiclassical theory yields the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the complex phase factor and the transport equation for the amplitude. These two equations can be combined to form a nonlinear semiclassical version of the KvH equation in configuration space. There is a natural injection of configuration space solutions into phase space and a natural projection of phase space solutions onto configuration space. Hence, every solution of the configuration space KvH equation satisfies both the semiclassical phase space KvH equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi constraint. For configuration space solutions, this constraint resolves the paradox that there are two different conserved densities in phase space. For integrable systems, the KvH spectrum is the Cartesian product of a classical and a semiclassical spectrum. If the classical spectrum is eliminated, then, with the correct choice of Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (JWKB) matching conditions, the semiclassical spectrum satisfies the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization conditions which include the correction due to the Maslov index. However, semiclassical analysis uses different choices for boundary conditions, continuity requirements, and the domain of definition. For example, use of the complex JWKB method allows for the treatment of tunneling through the complexification of phase space. Finally, although KvH wavefunctions include the possibility of interference effects, interference is not observable when all observables are approximated as local operators on phase space. Observing interference effects requires consideration of nonlocal operations, e.g. through higher orders in the asymptotic theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reference frames have attracted renewed interest recently, as their exploration is relevant and instructive in many areas of quantum theory. Among the different types, position and time reference frames have captivated special attention. Here, we introduce and analyze a nonrelativistic framework in which each system contains an internal clock, in addition to its external (spatial) degree of freedom and, hence, can be used as a spatiotemporal quantum reference frame. We present expressions for expectation values and variances of relevant observables in different perspectives, as well as relations between these quantities in different perspectives in scenarios with no interactions. In particular, we show that even in these simple scenarios, the relative uncertainty between clocks affects the relative spatial spread of the systems.</description>

Abstract: The dispersive interaction between a qubit and a cavity is ubiquitous in circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics. It describes the frequency shift of one quantum mode in response to excitations in the other, and in closed systems is necessarily bidirectional, i.e.~reciprocal. Here, we present an experimental study of a non-reciprocal dispersive-type interaction between a transmon qubit and a superconducting cavity, arising from a common coupling to dissipative intermediary modes with broken time reversal symmetry. We characterize the qubit-cavity dynamics, including asymmetric frequency pulls and photon shot-noise dephasing, under varying degrees of non-reciprocity by tuning the magnetic field bias of a ferrite component in situ. Furthermore, we show that the qubit-cavity dynamics is well-described in a wide parameter regime by a simple non-reciprocal master-equation model, which provides a compact description of the non-reciprocal interaction without requiring a full understanding of the complex dynamics of the intermediary system. Our result provides an example of quantum non-reciprocal phenomena beyond the typical paradigms of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and cascaded systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel ground-state energy estimation algorithm that is robust under global depolarizing error channels. Building upon the recently developed Quantum Exponential Least Squares (QCELS) algorithm, our new approach incorporates significant advancements to ensure robust estimation while maintaining a polynomial cost in precision. By leveraging the spectral gap of the Hamiltonian effectively, our algorithm overcomes limitations observed in previous methods like quantum phase estimation (QPE) and robust phase estimation (RPE). Going beyond global depolarizing error channels, our work underscores the significance and practical advantages of utilizing randomized compiling techniques to tailor quantum noise towards depolarizing error channels. Our research demonstrates the feasibility of ground-state energy estimation in the presence of depolarizing noise, offering potential advancements in error correction and algorithmic-level error mitigation for quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Informed Recursive Optimization Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and implement a family of quantum-informed recursive optimization (QIRO) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach leverages quantum resources to obtain information that is used in problem-specific classical reduction steps that recursively simplify the problem. These reduction steps address the limitations of the quantum component and ensure solution feasibility in constrained optimization problems. Additionally, we use backtracking techniques to further improve the performance of the algorithm without increasing the requirements on the quantum hardware. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach by informing QIRO with correlations from classical simulations of shallow (depth $p=1$) circuits of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), solving instances of maximum independent set and maximum satisfiability problems with hundreds of variables. We also demonstrate how QIRO can be deployed on a neutral atom quantum processor available online on Amazon Braket to find large independent sets of graphs. In summary, our scheme achieves results comparable to classical heuristics, such as simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, even with relatively weak quantum resources. Furthermore, enhancing the quality of these quantum resources improves the performance of the algorithms, highlighting the potential of QIRO. Notably, the modular nature of QIRO offers various avenues for modifications, positioning our work as a blueprint for designing a broader class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Effective-medium approach to the resonance distribution of wave scattering in a random point field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. A 105, 042205 (2022)], the distribution of resonance poles in the complex plane of the wavenumber $k$ associated to the multiple scattering of a quantum particle in a random point field was numerically discovered. This distribution presented two distinctive structures: a set of peaks at small $k$ when the wavelength is larger than the interscatterer distance, and a band almost parallel to the real axis at larger $k$. In this paper, a detailed theoretical study based on wave transport theory is proposed to explain the origin of these structures and to predict their distribution in the complex $k$ plane. First, it is shown that the peaks at small $k$ can be understood using an effective wave equation for the average wavefunction over the disorder. Then, that the band at large $k$ can be described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the square modulus of the wavefunction, which is derived from the diagrammatic method. This study is supported by careful comparisons with numerical simulations. The largest simulations revealed the presence of filaments alike quantum scars for the wavefunction in the bulk of the disordered medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pauli equation, an important equation of quantum mechanics, allows us to study the dynamics of spin-$1/2$ particles. The Dunkl derivative, when used instead of the ordinary derivative, leads to obtaining parity-dependent solutions. Motivated by these facts, in this work, we consider a two-dimensional nonrelativistic spin-$1/2$ particle system in the presence of an external magnetic field, and we investigate its parity-dependent dynamics by solving the Pauli equation analytically. Next, we assume the system to be in thermal equilibrium, and we examine various thermal quantities of the system.</description>

Abstract: Feedback-based control is the de-facto standard when it comes to controlling classical stochastic systems and processes. However, standard feedback-based control methods are challenged by quantum systems due to measurement induced backaction and partial observability. Here we remedy this by using weak quantum measurements and model-free reinforcement learning agents to perform quantum control. By comparing control algorithms with and without state estimators to stabilize a quantum particle in an unstable state near a local potential energy maximum, we show how a trade-off between state estimation and controllability arises. For the scenario where the classical analogue is highly nonlinear, the reinforcement learned controller has an advantage over the standard controller. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of using transfer learning to develop a quantum control agent trained via reinforcement learning on a classical surrogate of the quantum control problem. Finally, we present results showing how the reinforcement learning control strategy differs from the classical controller in the non-linear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tests of the envelope theory for three-body forces</title>

Abstract: Many-body forces, and specially three-body forces, are sometimes a relevant ingredient in various fields, such as atomic, nuclear or hadronic physics. As their precise structure is generally difficult to uncover or to implement, phenomenological effective forces are often used in practice. A form commonly used for a many-body variable is the square-root of the sum of two-body variables. Even in this case, the problem can be very difficult to treat numerically. But this kind of many-body forces can be handled at the same level of difficulty than two-body forces by the envelope theory. The envelope theory is a very efficient technique to compute approximate, but reliable, solutions of many-body systems, specially for identical particles. The quality of this technique is tested here for various three-body forces with non-relativistic systems composed of three identical particles. The energies, the eigenfunctions, and some observables are compared with the corresponding accurate results computed with a numerical variational method.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the potential application of quantum and hybrid quantum-classical neural networks in power flow analysis. Experiments are conducted using two datasets based on 4-bus and 33-bus test systems. A systematic performance comparison is also conducted among quantum, hybrid quantum-classical, and classical neural networks. The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) training dataset size needed, (iv) training error, and (v) training process stability. The results show that the developed hybrid quantum-classical neural network outperforms both quantum and classical neural networks, and hence can improve deep learning-based power flow analysis in the noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) and fault-tolerant quantum (FTQ) era.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method to simulate the Lindblad equation, drawing on the relationship between Lindblad dynamics, stochastic differential equations, and Hamiltonian simulations. We derive a sequence of unitary dynamics in an enlarged Hilbert space that can approximate the Lindblad dynamics up to an arbitrarily high order. This unitary representation can then be simulated using a quantum circuit that involves only Hamiltonian simulation and tracing out the ancilla qubits. There is no need for additional post-selection in measurement outcomes, ensuring a success probability of one at each stage. Our method can be directly generalized to the time-dependent setting. We provide numerical examples that simulate both time-independent and time-dependent Lindbladian dynamics with accuracy up to the third order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement between the degrees of freedom encountered in the classical world is challenging to observe due to the surrounding environment. To elucidate this issue, we investigate the entanglement generated over ultrafast timescales in a bipartite quantum system comprising two massive particles: a free-moving photoelectron, which expands to a mesoscopic length-scale, and a light-dressed atomic ion, which represents a hybrid state of light and matter. Although the photoelectron spectra are measured classically, the entanglement allows us to reveal information about the dressed-state dynamics of the ion and the femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses delivered by a seeded free-electron laser. The observed generation of entanglement is interpreted using the time-dependent von Neumann entropy. Our results unveil the potential for using short-wavelength coherent light pulses from free-electron lasers to generate entangled photoelectron and ion systems for studying spooky action at a distance.</description>

      <title>Engineering synthetic gauge fields through the coupling phases in cavity magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers, quantum memories, and devices with non-reciprocal behaviour. At microwave frequencies, the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often neglected in simple systems. However, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement between theory and the experimental data. Theses results show that in cavity magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for cavity-mediated coupling, dark mode memories, and building nonreciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Interior-Point Methods for Quantum Relative Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) programming is a recently popular and challenging class of convex optimization problems with significant applications in quantum computing and quantum information theory. We are interested in modern interior point (IP) methods based on optimal self-concordant barriers for the QRE cone. A range of theoretical and numerical challenges associated with such barrier functions and the QRE cones have hindered the scalability of IP methods. To address these challenges, we propose a series of numerical and linear algebraic techniques and heuristics aimed at enhancing the efficiency of gradient and Hessian computations for the self-concordant barrier function, solving linear systems, and performing matrix-vector products. We also introduce and deliberate about some interesting concepts related to QRE such as symmetric quantum relative entropy (SQRE). We also introduce a two-phase method for performing facial reduction that can significantly improve the performance of QRE programming. Our new techniques have been implemented in the latest version (DDS 2.2) of the software package DDS. In addition to handling QRE constraints, DDS accepts any combination of several other conic and non-conic convex constraints. Our comprehensive numerical experiments encompass several parts including 1) a comparison of DDS 2.2 with Hypatia for the nearest correlation matrix problem, 2) using DDS for combining QRE constraints with various other constraint types, and 3) calculating the key rate for quantum key distribution (QKD) channels and presenting results for several QKD protocols.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariance and maximality properties of the frequency spectrum of quantum neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a popular approach in Quantum Machine Learning due to their close connection to Variational Quantum Circuits, making them a promising candidate for practical applications on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A QNN can be expressed as a finite Fourier series, where the set of frequencies is called the frequency spectrum. We analyse this frequency spectrum and prove, for a large class of models, various maximality results. Furthermore, we prove that under some mild conditions there exists a bijection between classes of models with the same area $A = RL$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A = RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with arbitrarily many layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. If the generators of the QNN can be further decomposed into 2-dimensional sub-generators, then this specification follows from elementary number-theoretical considerations. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, we extend existing results based on the so-called Golomb ruler and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.</description>

Abstract: Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics. It is normally limited by Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show that putting the dielectric in motion can be useful for determining its susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric permeability is similar to that of moving dielectrics. (ii) A dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within relativistic optics. Certain features of the susceptibility can be determined without shining any incident field on the dielectric because the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies. When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced and and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit; it pertains to evanescent waves for (ii), but reaches the far-field domain for (i).</description>

Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computation is a paradigmatic model aiming to solve a computational problem by finding the many-body ground state encapsulating the solution. However, its use of an adiabatic evolution depending on the spectral gap of an intricate many-body Hamiltonian makes its analysis daunting. While it is plausible to directly cool the final gapped system of the adiabatic evolution instead, the analysis of such a scheme on a general ground is missing. Here, we propose a specific Hamiltonian model for this purpose. The scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving the emulation of a zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla reservoir qubits extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system toward its ground state. At the same time, the measurement of the discarded qubits hints at the energy level structure of the system as a return. We show that quantum computation based on this cooling procedure is equivalent in its computational power to the one based on quantum circuits. We then exemplify the scheme with a few illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems. In the first example, the cooling is free from any local energy minima, reducing the scheme to Grover's search algorithm with a few improvements. In the second example, the cooling suffers from abundant local energy minima. To circumvent this, we implant a mechanism in the Hamiltonian so that the population trapped in the local minima can tunnel out by high-order transitions. We support this idea with a numerical simulation for a particular combinatorial optimization problem. We also discuss its application to preparing quantum many-body ground states, arguing that the spectral gap is a crucial factor in determining the time scale of the cooling.</description>

Abstract: Portfolio optimization (PO) is extensively employed in financial services to assist in achieving investment objectives. By providing an optimal asset allocation, PO effectively balances the risk and returns associated with investments. However, it is important to note that as the number of involved assets and constraints increases, the portfolio optimization problem can become increasingly difficult to solve, falling into the category of NP-hard problems. In such scenarios, classical algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo method, exhibit limitations in addressing this challenge when the number of stocks in the portfolio grows. Quantum annealing algorithm holds promise for solving complex portfolio optimization problems in the NISQ era. Many studies have demonstrated the advantages of various quantum annealing algorithm variations over the standard quantum annealing approach. In this work, we conduct a numerical investigation of randomly generated unconstrained single-period discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization instances. We explore the application of a variety of unconventional quantum annealing algorithms, employing both forward annealing and reverse annealing schedules. By comparing the time-to-solution(TTS) and success probabilities of diverse approaches, we show that certain methods exhibit advantages in enhancing the success probability when utilizing conventional forward annealing schedules. Furthermore, we find that the implementation of reverse annealing schedules can significantly improve the performance of select unconventional quantum annealing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Tensor Neural Networks for Option Pricing</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled us to address the curse of dimensionality (COD) by solving problems in higher dimensions. A subset of such approaches of addressing the COD has led us to solving high-dimensional PDEs. This has resulted in opening doors to solving a variety of real-world problems ranging from mathematical finance to stochastic control for industrial applications. Although feasible, these deep learning methods are still constrained by training time and memory. Tackling these shortcomings, Tensor Neural Networks (TNN) demonstrate that they can provide significant parameter savings while attaining the same accuracy as compared to the classical Dense Neural Network (DNN). In addition, we also show how TNN can be trained faster than DNN for the same accuracy. Besides TNN, we also introduce Tensor Network Initializer (TNN Init), a weight initialization scheme that leads to faster convergence with smaller variance for an equivalent parameter count as compared to a DNN. We benchmark TNN and TNN Init by applying them to solve the parabolic PDE associated with the Heston model, which is widely used in financial pricing theory.</description>

      <title>Application of Tensor Neural Networks to Pricing Bermudan Swaptions</title>

Abstract: The Cheyette model is a quasi-Gaussian volatility interest rate model widely used to price interest rate derivatives such as European and Bermudan Swaptions for which Monte Carlo simulation has become the industry standard. In low dimensions, these approaches provide accurate and robust prices for European Swaptions but, even in this computationally simple setting, they are known to underestimate the value of Bermudan Swaptions when using the state variables as regressors. This is mainly due to the use of a finite number of predetermined basis functions in the regression. Moreover, in high-dimensional settings, these approaches succumb to the Curse of Dimensionality. To address these issues, Deep-learning techniques have been used to solve the backward Stochastic Differential Equation associated with the value process for European and Bermudan Swaptions; however, these methods are constrained by training time and memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging Tensor Neural Networks as they can provide significant parameter savings while attaining the same accuracy as classical Dense Neural Networks. In this paper we rigorously benchmark the performance of Tensor Neural Networks and Dense Neural Networks for pricing European and Bermudan Swaptions, and we show that Tensor Neural Networks can be trained faster than Dense Neural Networks and provide more accurate and robust prices than their Dense counterparts.</description>

Abstract: With rapid progress in simulation of strongly interacting quantum Hamiltonians, the challenge in characterizing unknown phases becomes a bottleneck for scientific progress. We demonstrate that a Quantum-Classical hybrid approach (QuCl) of mining sampled projective snapshots with interpretable classical machine learning can unveil signatures of seemingly featureless quantum states. The Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice under external magnetic field presents an ideal system to test QuCl, where simulations have found an intermediate gapless phase (IGP) sandwiched between known phases, launching a debate over its elusive nature. We use the correlator convolutional neural network, trained on labeled projective snapshots, in conjunction with regularization path analysis to identify signatures of phases. We show that QuCl reproduces known features of established phases. Significantly, we also identify a signature of the IGP in the spin channel perpendicular to the field direction, which we interpret as a signature of Friedel oscillations of gapless spinons forming a Fermi surface. Our predictions can guide future experimental searches for spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid phase in an optical lattice at mean-field level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an optical Raman square lattice with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ synthetic gauge flux to show chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase for cold atoms based on slave-rotor theory and spinon mean-field theory, respectively. An effective U($1$) gauge flux generated by Raman potentials plays a major role in realizing the CSL phase. By using slave-rotor techniques we find CSL phase at intermediate on-site Fermi Hubbard interacting regime. For the strong interacting regime we derive an effective spin model including up to the four spin interactions. By spinon mean-field analysis it is shown that CSL phase is stabilized in the case of strong magnetic frustration. The two mean-field approximation methods give consistent phase diagrams and provide qualitative numerical evidence of the CSL phase.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Scalar Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of the Lanczos coefficients in a family of free Lifshitz scalar theories, characterized by their integer dynamical exponent, at finite temperature. In this non-relativistic setup, we examine the effects of mass, finite ultraviolet cutoff, and finite lattice spacing on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients. We also investigate the effect of the dynamical exponent on the asymptotic behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, which show a universal scaling behavior. We carefully examine how these results can affect different measures in Krylov space, including Krylov complexity and entropy. Remarkably, we find that our results are similar to those previously observed in the literature for relativistic theories.</description>

      <title>Reshaped Three-Body Interactions and the Observation of an Efimov State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efimov trimers are exotic three-body quantum states that emerge from the different types of three-body continua in the vicinity of two-atom Feshbach resonances. In particular, as the strength of the interaction is decreased to a critical point, an Efimov state merges into the atom-dimer threshold and eventually dissociates into an unbound atom-dimer pair. Here we explore the Efimov state in the vicinity of this critical point using coherent few-body spectroscopy in $^7$Li atoms using a narrow two-body Feshbach resonance. Contrary to the expectation, we find that the $^7$Li Efimov trimer does not immediately dissociate when passing the threshold, and survives as a metastable state embedded in the atom-dimer continuum. We identify this behavior with a universal phenomenon related to the emergence of a repulsive interaction in the atom-dimer channel which reshapes the three-body interactions in any system characterized by a narrow Feshbach resonance. Specifically, our results shed light on the nature of $^7$Li Efimov states and provide a path to understand various puzzling phenomena associated with them.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Hubbard-Thouless pumps through nonlocal fermionic repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping represents a powerful concept to probe quantized topological invariants in quantum systems. We explore this mechanism in a generalized Rice-Mele Fermi-Hubbard model characterized by the presence of competing onsite and intersite interactions. Contrary to recent experimental and theoretical results, showing a breakdown of quantized pumping induced by the onsite repulsion, we prove that sufficiently large intersite interactions allow for an interaction-induced recovery of Thouless pumps. Our analysis further reveals that the occurrence of stable topological transport at large interactions is connected to the presence of a spontaneous bond-order-wave in the ground-state phase diagram of the model. Finally, we discuss a concrete experimental setup based on ultracold magnetic atoms in an optical lattice to realize the newly introduced Thouless pump. Our results provide a new mechanism to stabilize Thouless pumps in interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of random alloy GaBi$_{x}$As$_{1-x}$ barriers in InAs quantum dot molecules: alloy strain and orbital effects towards enhanced tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM). The two dots can be resonantly tuned to form "molecule-like" coupled hole states from the hybridization of hole states otherwise localized in each respective dot. Furthermore, spin-mixing of the hybridized states in dots offset along their stacking direction enables qubit rotation to be driven optically, allowing for an all-optical qubit control scheme. Increasing the magnitude of this spin mixing is important for optical quantum control protocols. To enhance the tunnel coupling and spin-mixing across the dots, we introduce Bi in the GaAs inter-dot barrier. Previously, we showed how to model InAs/GaBiAs in an atomistic tight-binding formalism, and how the dot energy levels are affected by the alloy. In this paper, we discuss the lowering of the tunnel barrier, which results in a three fold increase of hole tunnel coupling strength in the presence of a 7% alloy. Additionally, we show how an asymmetric strain between the two dots caused by the alloy shifts the resonance. Finally, we discuss device geometries for which the introduction of Bi is most advantageous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is bilinear in these fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum follows from the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows only linearly with the volume of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of free-fermion spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models can be found exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising and lowering operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of such spin chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant graph-theory construction. We also explain how this family admits an N=2 lattice supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Fast Minimization of Expected Logarithmic Loss via Stochastic Dual Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the problem of minimizing an expected logarithmic loss over either the probability simplex or the set of quantum density matrices. This problem includes tasks such as solving the Poisson inverse problem, computing the maximum-likelihood estimate for quantum state tomography, and approximating positive semi-definite matrix permanents with the currently tightest approximation ratio. Although the optimization problem is convex, standard iteration complexity guarantees for first-order methods do not directly apply due to the absence of Lipschitz continuity and smoothness in the loss function.
  In this work, we propose a stochastic first-order algorithm named $B$-sample stochastic dual averaging with the logarithmic barrier. For the Poisson inverse problem, our algorithm attains an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution in $\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ time, matching the state of the art, where $d$ denotes the dimension. When computing the maximum-likelihood estimate for quantum state tomography, our algorithm yields an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution in $\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ time. This improves on the time complexities of existing stochastic first-order methods by a factor of $d^{\omega-2}$ and those of batch methods by a factor of $d^2$, where $\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent. Numerical experiments demonstrate that empirically, our algorithm outperforms existing methods with explicit complexity guarantees.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures form the foundation of numerous nanoscale physical systems. However, measuring the properties of such heterostructures, and characterizing the semiconductor in-situ is challenging. A recent experimental study [arXiv:2107.03695] was able to probe the semiconductor within the heterostructure using microwave measurements of the superfluid density. This work revealed a rapid depletion of superfluid density in semiconductor, caused by the in-plane magnetic field which in presence of spin-orbit coupling creates so-called Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The experimental work used a simplified theoretical model that neglected the presence of non-magnetic disorder in the semiconductor, hence describing the data only qualitatively. Motivated by experiments, we introduce a theoretical model describing a disordered semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling that is proximitized by a superconductor. Our model provides specific predictions for the density of states and superfluid density. Presence of disorder leads to the emergence of a gapless superconducting phase, that may be viewed as a manifestation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface. When applied to real experimental data, our model showcases excellent quantitative agreement, enabling the extraction of material parameters such as mean free path and mobility, and estimating $g$-tensor after taking into account the orbital contribution of magnetic field. Our model can be used to probe in-situ parameters of other superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and can be further extended to give access to transport properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance. We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their (large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.</description>

      <title>First-Order Phase Transition of the Schwinger Model with a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the first-order phase transition in the lattice Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term by means of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Using two different fermion discretizations, Wilson and staggered fermions, we develop parametric ansatz circuits suitable for both discretizations, and compare their performance by simulating classically an ideal VQE optimization in the absence of noise. The states obtained by the classical simulation are then prepared on the IBM's superconducting quantum hardware. Applying state-of-the art error-mitigation methods, we show that the electric field density and particle number, observables which reveal the phase structure of the model, can be reliably obtained from the quantum hardware. To investigate the minimum system sizes required for a continuum extrapolation, we study the continuum limit using matrix product states, and compare our results to continuum mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that taking the additive mass renormalization into account is vital for enhancing the precision that can be obtained with smaller system sizes. Furthermore, for the observables we investigate we observe universality, and both fermion discretizations produce the same continuum limit.</description>

Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading conjecture for the emergence of statistical mechanics in generic isolated quantum systems and is formulated in terms of the matrix elements of operators. An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that entanglement velocities, which govern the spreading of entanglement, are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>

Abstract: The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$ trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with non-integer powers.</description>

      <title>More Excitement Across the Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector falling radially into a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, coupled linearly to a massless scalar field that has been prepared in the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh state, has recently been shown to exhibit a local extremum in its transition probability near the black hole horizon [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. We show that a similar phenomenon is present in the transition rate of a UDW detector falling radially into a spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, with the scalar field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking state. We give extensive numerical results as a function of the detector's energy gap, the black hole's mass, and the detector's drop-off radius. Our results suggest that the effect is robust, motivating a search for a similar effect in other black hole spacetimes, and calling for an explanation of the physical origin of the effect.</description>

      <title>X-ResQ: Reverse Annealing for Quantum MIMO Detection with Flexible Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA)-accelerated MIMO detection is an emerging research approach in the context of NextG wireless networks. The opportunity is to enable large MIMO systems and thus improve wireless performance. The approach aims to leverage QA to expedite the computation required for theoretically optimal but computationally-demanding Maximum Likelihood detection to overcome the limitations of the currently deployed linear detectors. This paper presents X-ResQ, a QA-based MIMO detector system featuring fine-grained quantum task parallelism that is uniquely enabled by the Reverse Annealing (RA) protocol. Unlike prior designs, X-ResQ has many desirable system properties for a parallel QA detector and has effectively improved detection performance as more qubits are assigned. In our evaluations on a state-of-the-art quantum annealer, fully parallel X-ResQ achieves near-optimal throughput (over 10 bits/s/Hz) for $4\times6$ MIMO with 16-QAM using six levels of parallelism with 240 qubits and $220~\mu$s QA compute time, achieving 2.5--5$\times$ gains compared against other tested detectors. For more comprehensive evaluations, we implement and evaluate X-ResQ in the non-quantum digital setting. This non-quantum X-ResQ demonstration showcases the potential to realize ultra-large $1024\times1024$ MIMO, significantly outperforming other MIMO detectors, including the state-of-the-art RA detector classically implemented in the same way.</description>
