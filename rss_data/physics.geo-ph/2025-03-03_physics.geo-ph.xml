      <title>Estimation of the minimum void ratio of binary soil mixtures: theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimum void ratio of sand-fine mixtures as a function of fines content is an important property to know in geotechnical engineering. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to estimate it. It takes into account both the insertion of fines into the granular skeleton of the sand when the size ratio allows it, and the way in which the particles are assembled.</description>

      <title>Log-Periodic Precursors to Volcanic Eruptions: Evidence from 34 Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting volcanic eruptions remains a formidable challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of volcanic processes. A key source of uncertainty arises from the sporadic nature of volcanic unrest, which is often characterised by intermittent phases of quiescent deceleration and sudden acceleration, rather than a consistent, predictable progression towards eruption. This seemingly erratic pattern complicates volcano forecasting as it challenges conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a simple smooth power law acceleration. We propose a log-periodic power law singularity model, which effectively captures the intermittent and non-monotonic rupture dynamics characteristic of reawakening volcanoes at the site scale. Mathematically, generalising the power law exponent by extending it from real to complex numbers, this model captures the partial break of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance that is inherent to the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture processes in heterogeneous crustal systems. By performing parametric and nonparametric tests on a large dataset of 34 historical eruptions worldwide, we present empirical evidence and theoretical arguments demonstrating the statistical significance of log-periodic oscillations decorating power law finite-time singularities during pre-eruptive volcanic unrest. Log-periodicity in volcanoes may originate from various mechanisms, including diffusion-dominated magma flow, magma-driven propagation of subparallel dykes, interaction between stress drop and stress corrosion, and/or interplay of inertia, damage, and healing within volcanic systems. Our results have important implications for volcano forecasting, because understanding and characterising log-periodicity could turn the intermittency of volcanic activity from a challenge into a valuable asset for improving predictions.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory finite-time singularities in rockbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting violent rockbursts remains a formidable challenge due to significant uncertainties involved. One major uncertainty arises from the intermittency of rock failure processes, typically characterised by a series of progressively shorter quiescent phases punctuated by sudden accelerations, rather than a smooth continuous progression towards the final breakdown. This non-monotonic evolution of rock mass deformation complicates rockburst prediction, challenging conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a smooth power law accelerating behaviour. Here, we introduce a generalised time-to-failure model called log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model to effectively capture the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture processes in rock leading up to violent rockbursts. We perform parametric and nonparametric tests on 11 historical rockburst events at three underground mines, documenting empirical evidence and providing theoretical arguments to demonstrate the significance of log-periodic oscillatory power law finite-time singularities. Log-periodicity in these rockburst events is likely driven by the interaction of subparallel propagating cracks, the diffusion of stress-triggering processes, or the interplay between stress drop and stress corrosion. Our results and insights obtained have significant implications for not only understanding but also forecasting rockbursts, as recognising and characterising log-periodicity can help transform intermittency from traditionally perceived noise into valuable predictive information.</description>

      <title>Effects of conjugate heat transfer on large-scale flow structures in convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constant temperature and constant heat flux thermal boundary conditions, both developing distinct flow patterns, represent limiting cases of ideally conducting and insulating plates in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) flows, respectively. This study bridges the gap in between, using a conjugate heat transfer (CHT) set-up and studying finite thermal diffusivity ratios $\kapparatioIL$ to better represent real-life conditions in experiments. A three-dimensional RBC configuration including two fluid-confining plates is studied via direct numerical simulation given a Prandtl number $\Pr=1$. The fluid layer of height $H$ and horizontal extension $L$ obeys no-slip boundary conditions at the two solid-fluid interfaces and an aspect ratio of $\Gamma=L/H=30$, while the relative thickness of each plate is $\Gs=H_s/H=15$. The entire domain is laterally periodic. Here, different $\kapparatioIL$ are investigated for Rayleigh numbers of $\Ra=\left\{ 10^4, 10^5 \right\}$. We observe a gradual shift of the size of the characteristic flow patterns and their induced heat and mass transfer as $\kapparatioIL$ is varied, suggesting a relation between the recently studied turbulent superstructures and supergranules for constant temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions, respectively. Performing a linear stability analysis for this CHT configuration confirms these observations theoretically while extending previous studies by investigating the impact of a varying solid plate thickness $\Gs$. Moreover, we study the impact of $\kapparatioIL$ on the thermal and viscous boundary layers. Given the prevalence of finite $\kapparatioIL$ in nature, this work also extends our understanding of pattern formation in geo- and astrophysical convection flows.</description>

      <title>Diffusive and Adiabatic Meridional Overturning Circulations in the Cooling Abyss of the Indo-Pacific Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent field campaigns have consistently documented bottom-intensified mixing near the seafloor, suggesting diabatic downwelling in the abyssal ocean. This phenomenon appears to contradict with the mass balance of the abyssal ocean, where dense bottom water plunges into the region from the Antarctic side. Previous studies have sought to resolve this apparent paradox by proposing mixing-induced diabatic upwelling along bottom slopes. In contrast, this study offers an alternative perspective, highlighting the role of isopycnal displacement in the transient abyss. Motivated by emerging evidence of a cooling phase in the abyssal Indo-Pacific, likely linked to the last Little Ice Age, this study reinterprets the interior-downwelling paradox from the perspective of unsteady thermal states. Idealized numerical experiments were conducted to explore the abyssal overturning dynamics, with a focus on the behavior of advective, adiabatic, and diffusive overturning circulation streamfunctions in both cooling and warming scenarios. The results reveal that while the direction of diabatic overturning (upwelling or downwelling) depends on the transient state of the ocean, advective overturning circulation consistently exhibits an upwelling pattern, underscoring the inherent robustness of upward water parcel movement within abyssal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gabor-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fast Simulations of Acoustic Wavefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained increasing attention for solving partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation, due to their flexibility and mesh-free formulation. However, their low-frequency bias limits their accuracy and convergence speed for high-frequency wavefield simulations. To alleviate these problems, we propose a simplified PINN framework that incorporates Gabor functions, designed to capture the oscillatory and localized nature of wavefields more effectively. Unlike previous attempts that rely on auxiliary networks to learn Gabor parameters, we redefine the network's task to map input coordinates to a custom Gabor coordinate system, simplifying the training process without increasing the number of trainable parameters compared to a simple PINN. We validate the proposed method across multiple velocity models, including the complex Marmousi and Overthrust models, and demonstrate its superior accuracy, faster convergence, and better robustness features compared to both traditional PINNs and earlier Gabor-based PINNs. Additionally, we propose an efficient integration of a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) to enhance wavefield behavior near the boundaries. These results suggest that our approach offers an efficient and accurate alternative for scattered wavefield modeling and lays the groundwork for future improvements in PINN-based seismic applications.</description>
