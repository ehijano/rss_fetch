      <title>A general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics extension to mesh-less schemes in the code GIZMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The profound comprehension of the evolution and phenomenology of an Active Galactic Nucleus requires an accurate exploration of the dynamics of the magnetized gaseous disk surrounding the massive black hole in the centre. Many numerical simulations have studied this environment using elaborate grid-based codes, but in recent years, new mesh-less schemes have exhibited excellent conservation properties and good accuracy at a more moderate computational cost. Still, none implement general relativistic magnetic fields, a fundamental ingredient to model an accretion disk around a massive black hole. We present here a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) scheme working within the mesh-less framework of the code \texttt{GIZMO}. We implement the hyperbolic divergence cleaning procedure, consistently extended to general relativistic effects, to keep the magnetic field divergence under safe levels. We benchmark the scheme against various relativistic magnetohydrodynamics stress tests, considering different dimensionalities and both a Minkowski or a Schwarzchild/Kerr background. To date, this is the first GRMHD scheme working in a mesh-free environment.</description>

      <title>Modeling Targets and Optimal Frequencies for Imaging the Shadows of Nearby Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizon-scale imaging of supermassive black holes has opened a new window onto the studies of strong-field gravity and plasma physics in low-luminosity accretion flows. As future efforts aim to image fainter and smaller angular-size targets, primarily through space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), it is important to identify optimal sources and observing strategies for such studies. In this work, we assess the prospects for imaging black hole shadows in a broad population of nearby supermassive black holes by modeling their accretion flows using a covariant semi-analytic model for the flow and general relativistic ray tracing. We explore the influence of black hole and accretion flow parameters on spectra, image morphology, and the critical frequency at which the flows become optically thin. We identify three general classes of sources: those that become transparent at traditional imaging frequencies; those requiring higher frequencies; and those unlikely to be transparent down to the black hole shadow in the submillimeter band. Our results will inform target selection and wavelength optimization for future VLBI arrays, where both resolution and transparency are essential for resolving black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Weak Bursts on Slowly Accreting Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly all observed thermonuclear X-ray bursts are thought to be triggered by the thermally unstable triple-alpha process. Unlike in accreting white dwarfs, the $\gtrsim10^{8} \mathrm{K}$ envelope temperature forces hydrogen burning to proceed via the $\beta$-limited, thermally stable hot CNO cycle. Recent observations of weak X-ray bursts from SAX J1808.4-3658 occurring within 1-3 days of the onset of an accretion outburst have raised the question that these bursts were triggered by thermally unstable hydrogen ignition, analogously to classical novae. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we explore the unstable ignition of hydrogen on slowly accreting neutron stars. For solar metallicities, the burning is insufficiently vigorous to launch convection and the burst rise is on the envelope thermal timescale, with the hydrogen being consumed over hours. For elevated metallicities ($Z\gtrsim0.06$), however, the initial proton captures onto CNO nuclei heat the envelope enough to drive convection and produce a sharp peak in the luminosity. This peak can match that of the SAX J1808.4-3658 burst, for sufficient enrichment. Following this peak, the hydrogen burning stabilizes at a rate set solely by the ignition depth and CNO abundance in the accreted matter. This quasi-steady-state burning produces an extended tail of elevated emission that lasts until the hydrogen is exhausted. Observations of the tail's luminosity and duration measure the hydrogen and metallicity abundance of the accreted material, while the distance-independent ratio of peak-to-tail luminosities would suggest the presence of significant metallicity gradients prior to convection.</description>

      <title>No Clear Correlation between X-ray Spectral Properties and Polarization for High Synchrotron Peaked Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IXPE has enabled the X-ray polarizations of many blazars to be measured. We analyze X-ray spectropolarimetric data for all high synchrotron peaked blazars observations published by the IXPE team. We find that there are no statistically significant correlations between the X-ray polarimetric properties of the blazars and their X-ray spectral properties. This implies that there is no connection between the energy distribution of the X-ray emitting electrons and the uniformity of the magnetic field in the X-ray emitting regions of these blazars. We also find that the X-ray polarizations vary significantly between blazars and observations of the same blazar, implying the level of uniformity of the magnetic field in the X-ray emitting region is highly variable. This result will inform future theoretical work and potentially help narrow down the acceleration process of the synchrotron electrons.</description>

      <title>IIb or not IIb: A Catalog of ZTF Kilonova Imposters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the various classes of fast optical transients (FOTs), kilonovae (KNe), which can emerge as a result of neutron star mergers, are extremely challenging to observe because of not only the rapid timescale on which they fade (on the order of days), but also due to the relative scarcity of their occurrence. This scarcity is compounded by the large number of other FOTs that may initially resemble the characteristic rise of a KNe. While these objects can be ruled out as candidate KNe by taking spectroscopy, a method of confidently ruling out transients based on photometric analysis alone would be incredibly valuable. We describe the compilation of various ``imposter" transients, including a plurality of IIb SNe, and investigate a number of comparative metrics by which one might be able to remove transients from consideration without the use of spectroscopy. We provide a list of these objects and their classifications as well as a glossary of the transient types included in the sample.</description>

      <title>Direct Inference of Nuclear Equation-of-State Parameters from Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of neutron star mergers with gravitational waves (GWs) has provided a new method to constrain the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and to better understand its nuclear physics. However, inferring nuclear microphysics from GW observations necessitates the sampling of EOS model parameters that serve as input for each EOS used during the GW data analysis. The sampling of the EOS parameters requires solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations a large number of times -- a process that slows down each likelihood evaluation in the analysis on the order of a few seconds. Here, we employ emulators for the TOV equations built using multilayer perceptron neural networks to enable direct inference of nuclear EOS parameters from GW strain data. Our emulators allow us to rapidly solve the TOV equations, taking in EOS parameters and outputting the associated tidal deformability of a neutron star in only a few tens of milliseconds. We implement these emulators in \texttt{PyCBC} to directly infer the EOS parameters using the event GW170817, providing posteriors on these parameters informed solely by GWs. We benchmark these runs against analyses performed using the full TOV solver and find that the emulators achieve speed ups of nearly \emph{two orders of magnitude}, with negligible differences in the recovered posteriors. Additionally, we constrain the slope and curvature of the symmetry energy at the 90\% upper credible interval to be $L_{\rm sym}\lesssim106$ MeV and $K_{\rm sym}\lesssim26$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Longtime Monitoring of TeV Radio Galaxies with HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the monitoring of the TeV-emitting radio galaxies M87, NGC~1275, 3C~264, and IC~310 with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) over a period of approximately $7.5$ years. The analysis includes light curves at daily, weekly and monthly time scales for the four sources. We report the detection of gamma-ray emission from M87 with a significance exceeding 5$\sigma$. Due to its significant detection, this work reports the integrated TeV spectrum of M87 from the longest temporal coverage up to date. The source is well described as a point-like source modeled by a power law spectrum with spectral index $\alpha = 2.53\pm0.29$ and a flux of $(7.09\pm 1.24)\times10^{-13}$ $\rm{cm}^{-2}\,{s}^{-1}\,{TeV}^{-1}$ at $1\,\rm{TeV}$. The maximum energy of the detected emission in M87, at 1$\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.), reaches 26.5 TeV. HAWC's observation of M87 reveals a low flux spectrum for the longest observation to date of this radio galaxy. 3C~264 is marginally detected with a significance slightly below 4$\sigma$, while NGC~1275 and IC~310 are not detected. The weekly light curves show an increased number of fluxes above $2\sigma$ for M87 starting in 2019, and for 3C~264 starting in 2018, which can be interpreted as the moment for which these sources start to exhibit an enhanced steady TeV emission. Overall, in the four radio galaxies, the cumulative significance over time indicates a behavior that resembles that of a gamma-ray variable active galaxy, such as the blazar Markarian 421. This supports the importance of monitoring radio galaxies to identify periods of higher activity and flares, enabling further multi-messenger studies.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the z=4-10 X-ray Luminosity Function: the high space density of moderate-luminosity, obscured AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SMBHs are theorised to undergo significant growth in the early Universe, however, the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), used as a principal tracer of the SMBH accretion density, lacks observational constraints at z&gt;6, until now. We present new measurements of the z=4-10 XLF at intermediate luminosities, taking advantage of recent deep near-IR imaging from UltraVISTA that enables us to identify galaxies and AGN at high redshifts within which we identify X-ray sources using Chandra COSMOS data. We first performed a cross-match to a deep Chandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately quantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct extraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies. With the resulting z=4-10 X-ray AGN sample, comprised of 21 blind detections and 11 directly extracted detections, we have measured the early space density of AGN, at moderate-luminosities where the majority of early SMBH growth occurred. These measurements reveal higher space-densities than expected, based on the extrapolation of XLF models from lower redshifts. Whilst our measured space densities at z=4-5 are consistent with model predictions, at z=5-7 we find space densities of the order of 10$\times$ the extrapolated model predictions and could be as high as 220$\times$ the model extrapolations at z=7-10. In addition, we find evidence that a large fraction of the early AGN population are heavily obscured, with an obscured fraction of 0.982$^{+0.007}_{-0.008}$; correcting for this obscuration further increases the measured space densities. Comparing to recent JWST results, these measurements begin to bridge the gap between the bright-end of the quasar luminosity function and the latest JWST observations of very early, low-luminosity AGN, indicating a larger fraction of the first galaxies play host to rapidly growing SMBH than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Progenitor Insights of Type IIP SN 2018pq: A Comprehensive Photometric and Spectroscopic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-cadence photometric and low-resolution (R $\sim$ 400--700) optical spectroscopic observations of Type IIP supernova, SN~2018pq, which exploded on the outskirts of the galaxy IC~3896A. The optically thick phase (``plateau'') lasts approximately 97 d, the plateau duration of normal Type IIP supernovae. SN~2018pq has a {\em V}-band absolute magnitude of $-16.42 \pm 0.01$ mag at 50 d, resembles normal-luminous supernova, and the V-band decline rate of 0.42$\pm$0.06 mag 50 d$^{-1}$ during the plateau phase. A steeper decline rate of 11.87$\pm$1.68 mag 100 d$^{-1}$ was observed compared to that of typical Type IIP supernovae during the transition between plateau to nebular phase. We employ detailed radiative transfer spectra modelling, TARDIS, to reveal the photospheric temperature and velocity at two spectral epochs. The well-fitted model spectra indicate SN~2018pq is a spectroscopically normal Type IIP supernova. Semi-analytical light curve modelling suggests the progenitor as a red supergiant star with an ejecta mass of $\sim$11 $M_\odot$ and an initial radius of 424 $R_\odot$. On the contrary, hydrodynamical modelling suggests a higher mass progenitor between 14--16 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Extragalactic Magnetic Field: Auger Data Meet UHECR Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses from the Pierre Auger Collaboration suggest correlations between the arrival directions of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and catalogs of starburst galaxies (SGBs) and jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We revisit these analyses using the same methodology as \auger , but explicitly incorporating UHECR deflections in turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs). We demonstrate that while for SBGs the same sources as for the generic \auger\ analysis dominate the catalog correlations, jetted AGNs are dominated by Centaurus~A when accounting for source distances and deflections. Using our framework, we derive 90\% confidence level upper limits on the local EGMF strength of 4.4~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for SBGs and 6.7~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for jetted AGNs. Assuming instead that the UHECR deflections predominantly arise from the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we obtain a GMF upper limit of $1.4 \, \mu$G~kpc$^{1/2}$ for a Galactic halo size of 30~kpc.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray and Interstellar Gas Properties in the Solar Neighborhood Revealed by Diffuse Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the interstellar medium (ISM) and Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the solar neighborhood, we analyzed ${\gamma}$-ray data by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) for five nearby molecular cloud regions. Our data includes the MBM/Pegasus region (MBM~53, 54, 55 clouds and Pegasus loop), R CrA region (R Coronae Australis clouds), Chamaeleon region (Chamaeleon clouds), Cep/Pol region (Cepheus and Polaris flare), and Orion region (Orion clouds). The ISM templates are constructed by a component decomposition of the 21~cm {\HI} line, the Planck dust emission model, and the carbon monoxide (CO) 2.6~mm line. Through $\gamma$-ray data analysis the ISM gas is successfully decomposed into non-local {\HI}, narrow-line and optically thick {\HI}, broad-line and optically thin {\HI}, CO-bright {\Htwo}, and CO-dark {\Htwo} for all five regions. CR intensities evaluated by the ${\gamma}$-ray emissivity of broad {\HI} agree well with a model based on directly-measured CR spectra at the Earth, with a gradient giving a higher CR intensity toward the inner Galaxy at the 10\% level in ${\sim}$ 500~pc. The ratio of CO-dark {\Htwo} to CO-bright {\Htwo} anti-correlates with the {\Htwo} mass traced by the CO 2.6~mm line, and reaches 5--10 for small systems of ${\sim}$1000 solar mass.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Frontiers of Cosmic Ray Physics: Perspectives on GRANDProto300 and the GRAND Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned large-scale radio array designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E &gt; 100$ PeV) and neutrinos. Employing cost-effective antennas distributed across vast areas, GRAND is optimized to observe the rare flux of ultra-high-energy particles with high precision. The GRANDProto300 (GP300) pathfinder array, currently under deployment, targets the $10^{16.5} - 10^{18}$ eV range and is anticipated to achieve approximately 15\% energy resolution and 20g/cm$^2$ $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ precision. This level of precision enables accurate measurements of the fine structure of the energy spectrum, mean logarithmic mass ($\langle \ln A \rangle$), and proton flux within this range. After five years of data collection, the sensitivity for detecting anisotropy could reach $5 \times 10^{-3}$ for energies below $10^{17.1}$ eV. With its substantially larger effective area, GRAND extends these capabilities to the highest energies ($\sim 10^{20}$ eV), offering enhanced statistics and sensitivity for spectral, composition, and anisotropy measurements within one year for UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for SETI at High Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy SETI pushes astrobiology to its limits, testing the most fundamental needs of life and the most extreme limits of technology. It has lagged behind the rest of the field, but the increased respectability of SETI could spark interest in the coming years. This white paper reviews the case for SETI in X-rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos, including rationales, challenges, and possible technosignatures, and suggests future strategies for observational work.</description>

      <title>How the spin-phase variability of cyclotron lines shapes the pulsed fraction spectra: insights from 4U 1538-52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-dependent pulse profile of 4U 1538-52 and its phase-dependent spectral variability, with emphasis on the behavior around the cyclotron resonant scattering feature at around 21 keV. We analyze all available NuSTAR observations of 4U 1538-52. We decompose energy-resolved pulse profiles into Fourier harmonics to study their energy dependence. Specifically, we compute pulsed fraction spectra, cross-correlation and lag spectra, identifying discontinuities and linking them to features in the phase-averaged spectra. We perform phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectral analyses to probe spectral variability and its relation to pulse profile changes. Finally, we interpret our findings via physical modeling of energy- and angle-dependent pulse profile emission, performing radiative transfer in a homogeneous slab-like atmosphere under conditions relevant to 4U 1538-52. The emission is projected onto the observer's sky plane to derive expected observables. In contrast to the dips in pulsed fraction spectra observed in other sources (e.g., Her X-1), we find a broad bump near the cyclotron resonance energy in 4U 1538-52. This increase is driven primarily by phase-dependent spectral variability, especially by strong variations in cyclotron line depth across different phase intervals. We interpret the observed contrast between dips and bumps in various sources as arising from phase-dependent variations of cyclotron line depth relative to the phase-modulated flux. We model the X-ray emission from an accreting neutron star and find that our simulations indicate high values of both the observer's inclination and the magnetic obliquity, along with a 10-15 degrees asymmetry between the locations of the magnetic poles. Assuming this geometry, we satisfactorily reproduce the observed pulse profiles and introduce general trends in the observables resulting from the system's geometry.</description>

      <title>An unusual type-I X-ray burst from the neutron star X-ray binary IGR J17591-2342: a double-photospheric-radius-expansion burst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-I X-ray bursts observed from neutron stars originate from intermittent unstable thermonuclear burning of accreted matter on these stars. Such bursts, particularly those reaching the Eddington luminosity and having a temporary photospheric radius-expansion due to radiation pressure, provide a testbed to study nuclear fusion processes in intense radiation, gravity, and magnetic fields. Here, we investigate time-resolved spectroscopic properties of a type-I burst from the accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17591-2342. Our basic spectral model includes an absorbed blackbody to describe the burst emission and an absorbed power law to represent the non-burst emission. The blackbody normalisation shows two consecutive humps aligned with blackbody temperature dips during the burst. Such an unusual behaviour could imply two consecutive photospheric radius-expansion events during the same burst or a systematic metallicity evolution in the neutron star atmosphere. However, our spectral analysis suggests the latter option is less likely to be happening for IGR J17591-2342. The novel former option implies that sufficient fuel survived after the first photospheric radius-expansion event to power a second similar event a few seconds later, challenging the current theoretical understanding. If confirmed, the double photospheric radius-expansion event observed in IGR J17591-2342 suggests the possibility of avoiding photospheric expansion at luminosities exceeding Eddington. Mechanisms such as temporary enhancement of the magnetic field by convection and confinement of the plasma could be invoked to explain the peculiar behaviour of the source.</description>

      <title>The Vela pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula Vela-X using 13 years of Fermi-LAT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of more than 13 years of Fermi-LAT data analysis for the Vela pulsar from 60 MeV to 100 GeV and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), Vela-X, for E &gt; 1 GeV in the off-pulse phases. We find the Vela-X PWN can be best characterized using two extended components: a large radial Gaussian accompanied by an off-set, compact radial disk, both with a similar spectral index, \Gamma \sim 2.3. The common spectral properties support a common PWN origin, but a supernova remnant component is plausible for the compact radial disk. With an updated Vela-X model, the phase resolved spectral properties of the Vela pulsar are explored through a phase-resolved analysis. The phase-resolved spectral properties of the pulsar are presented, such as the SED peak energy E$_p$, the width of the SED at its peak, d$_p$, and the asymptotic (low-energy) spectral index, $\Gamma_0$, are presented. The best-fit spectral models for each LAT pulse peak (Peak 1 and Peak 2) are extrapolated to UV energies and compared to archival, phase-resolved spectra at UV, X-ray, soft \gamma-ray and TeV energies. We also discuss the physical implications of our modeling and the data comparisons.</description>

      <title>Exploring MAXI J1744-294: IXPE insights into a Newly Discovered X-ray Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first IXPE spectro-polarimetric observation of the black hole candidate MAXI J1744$-$294, a transient X-ray source discovered during a bright 2025 outburst in the Galactic center region. During the $\sim$150 ks observation, the source was found in the soft state, and its spectrum was well described by an absorbed multicolor disk with a minor high-energy tail. No significant polarization was detected, and we derived a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the polarization degree of $1.3\%$ in the 2--8 keV energy band. This result is consistent with previous findings for soft-state black hole binaries observed at low to intermediate inclination angles. By comparing the polarization degree upper limit with theoretical predictions for standard accretion disk emission, we constrain the disk inclination to $i \lesssim 38^\circ$--$71^\circ$, depending on the black hole spin and the disk atmosphere albedo.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>

      <title>SRG/eROSITA No. 5: Discovery of quasi-periodic eruptions every ~3.7 days from a galaxy at z&gt;0.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating soft X-ray bursts from the nuclei of galaxies, tantalizingly proposed to be extreme mass ratio inspirals. Here, we report the discovery of a new galaxy showing X-ray QPEs, the fifth found through a dedicated blind search in the \emph{SRG}/eROSITA all-sky survey data, hereafter named eRO-QPE5. Its QPE duration ($t_{\rm dur}\sim0.6$\,d), recurrence time ($t_{\rm recur}\sim3.7\,$d), integrated energy per eruption ($\sim3.4 \times 10^{47}\,$erg), and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}\sim 2.8 \times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$) sit at the high end of the known population. Like other eROSITA or X-ray-discovered QPEs, no previous or concurrent optical-IR transient is found in archival photometric datasets, and the optical spectrum looks almost featureless. With a spectroscopic redshift of $0.1155$, eRO-QPE5 is the most distant QPE source discovered to date. Given the number of recent discoveries, we test for possible correlations and confirm a connection between $t_{\rm dur}$ and $t_{\rm recur}$, while we do not find any significant correlation involving either $M_{\rm BH}$ or the QPE temperature. The slope of the $t_{\rm dur}-t_{\rm recur}$ relation ($1.14\pm0.16$) is roughly consistent with predictions from star-disk collision models, with a preference for those that suggest that QPEs are powered by stellar debris streams around the orbiter. Considering this and previous discoveries, eROSITA has proved extremely successful in finding many QPE candidates given its grasp, namely its sensitivity and large field of view, and scanning capabilities over the full sky. We advocate the need of sensitive wide-area and time-domain oriented surveys from future-generation soft X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>The Average Soft X-ray Spectra of eROSITA Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. AGNs are strong X-ray emitters shaped by disk-corona interactions. The soft excess (0.5-2.0 keV) reveals key information about the "warm corona" bridging the disk and hot corona. Yet, how this feature evolves with accretion properties remains poorly constrained, especially in large samples using spectral stacking. Aims. The eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS:5) provides an unprecedented sample. We investigate how the average AGN X-ray spectra evolve with accretion parameters, and explore disk-corona connection by further combining stacked UV data. Methods. We developed Xstack, a novel tool that stacks rest-frame X-ray spectra and responses while preserving spectral shape through optimized weighting. We stack 17929 AGNs ("spec-z" sample, 23 Ms) with similar X-ray loudness alpha_ox, UV luminosity L_UV, and 4159 AGNs ("BH-mass" sample, 3 Ms) with similar Eddington ratio lambda_Edd and black hole mass M_BH. The resulting stacked X-ray spectra are analyzed with a phenomenological model. We further fit the stacked optical-UV-Xray SED with AGNSED model. Results. Soft excess strengthens strongly with alpha_ox and lambda_Edd (~5), while the hard X-ray spectral shape remains largely unchanged, supporting that soft excess is dominated by warm corona rather than reflection. AGNSED modeling reveals that warm corona radius (R_g units) generally increases with lambda_Edd and decreases with M_BH, or equivalently the disk-to-warm-corona transition consistently occurs near 1e4 K. The hot corona contracts with lambda_Edd and is unaffected by M_BH, aligning with disk evaporation predictions. Conclusions. The soft excess likely originates from a warm corona, with the disk to warm corona transition tied to hydrogen ionization near 1e4 K - supporting earlier eFEDS-HSC stacking results (Hagen et al. 2024). This study shows the strength of spectral stacking in probing AGN disk-corona physics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a steeper SMBH-Bulge mass relationship extended to low masses using TDE host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are excellent tools for probing low mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that may otherwise remain undetected. Here, we present an extended SMBH--Bulge mass scaling relationship using these lower mass TDE black holes and their host galaxies. Bulge masses are derived using Prospector fits to UV-MIR spectral energy distributions for the hosts of 40 TDEs that have a detected late-time UV/optical plateau emission, from which a SMBH mass is derived. Overall, we find that TDE plateaus are a successful method for probing BH scaling relations. We combine the observed TDE sample with a higher mass SMBH sample and extend the known relationship, recovering a steeper slope ($m = 1.34 \pm 0.03$) than current literature estimates, which focus on the high mass regime. For the TDE only sample, we measure an equally significant but shallower relationship with a power-law slope of $m = 1.17 \pm 0.10$ and significance $&lt;0.001$. Forward modelling is used to determine whether known selection effects can explain both the comparatively flatter TDE only relation and the overall steepening across the full SMBH mass range. We find that the flattening at TDE masses can be accounted for, however the steepening can not. It appears that if a single slope extends for the whole BH mass range, it must be steeper to include the TDE population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the discovered Higgs boson with $m_H$=125 GeV is interpreted as a $t\bar{t}$-boson where the $t$-quarks are bound by Higgs-exchange with binding energy 220 GeV, then the $2t$-baryons should have approximately the same mass as the Higgs-boson. As $m_H&lt;m_t$, the life time of $2t$-baryons must be much bigger then the life time of $1t$-baryons. If in the primordial Universe the number of $2\bar{t}$-antibaryons was bigger than the number of $2t$-baryons, then the excess should be compensated by nucleons. The relatively long living heavy $2\bar{t}$-antibaryons could in primordial Universe fast evolve to antimatter black halls and disappear in the world of matter under the Schwarzschild spheres.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

      <title>Analysis of shape and angular orientation parameters of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation signals in Galactic Centers for FIRE simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulations of Milky Way size galaxy halos to characterize the shape of the J-factor emission signal on the sky. We find that, at a fixed dJ/d{\Omega} contour,the shape is well-fit by an ellipse, with semi-major axis Rmajor and semi-minor axis Rminor measured in degrees on the sky. We use least squares fitting to fit ellipses to the J-factor emission, viewed from the solar location. The ratio of minor to major axes (Rminor/Rmajor) allows us to characterize the shape of each contour, with ratio 1.0 corresponding to circular/spherical emission. These results provide new expectations for the shape of dark matter annihilation emission signals we might expect to see if dark matter is annihilating with its own anti-particle. We find that both the shape and angular orientation of the emission signal is different than results predict from dark matter only simulations. In terms of shape, we find that the ratios of semi-minor to semi-major axis is always consistently at 0.8, revealing a consistent circular emission shape, whereas with dark matter only emission signals the range of ratios from halo to halo is broader, and often closer to 0.5, showing a much more elliptical shape in general. In terms of angular orientation, we find that the major axis of the J-factor emission signal maps for FIRE halos are consistently aligned with the galactic plane within a few degrees, meaning that excess emission out of the plane would be hard to explain with a dark matter annihilation signal. However, we also find that the expected emission signal would be consistent with Fermi-LAT measurements showing a galactic center excess in full hydrodynamical simulations with stars and gas included, while dark-matter-only simulations do not produce the expected signal.</description>

      <title>Chiral Invariant Mass Constraints from HESS J1731 347 in an Extended Parity Doublet Model with Isovector Scalar Meson</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of a central compact object (CCO) within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, with mass $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17} \ M_\odot $ and radius $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km is the lightest and smallest compact object ever observed. We identify it as an ultra-light Neutron star (NS) and constrain the chiral invariant mass of nucleon $m_0$ from the observational data of NS using an extended parity doublet model with including the isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$. We study the higher order asymmertic matter properties such as the symmetry incompressibility $K_{sym}$ and the symmetry skewness $Q_{sym}$ in the presence of $a_0$ meson. We find that $K_{sym}$ and $Q_{sym}$ is sensitive to the chiral invariant mass of nucleon $m_0$ in the presence of $a_0$ meson. We show that the equation of state in the present model satisfies all observational constraints within $2\sigma$ credible region including the HESS J1731-347 observation, as well as the constraint from $K_{sym}$ when $740 \,\text{ MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860 \,\text{ MeV}$ for $L_0 = $ 57.7 MeV. Yet, the $1\sigma$ constraint from neutron stars appears to be not fully compatible with the constraint from $K_{sym}$ from the present model.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Formation of Macro-Scale Flow and Magnetic Fields in the Relativistic Gas of Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a simple quasi-equilibrium analysis of a multi-component plasma can be harnessed to explain catastrophic energy transformations in astrophysical objects. We limit ourselves to the particular class of binary systems for which the typical plasma consists of one classical ion component, and two relativistic electron components - the bulk degenerate electron gas with a small contamination of hot electrons. We derive, analytically, the conditions conducive to such a catastrophic change. The pathway to such sudden changes is created by the slow changes in the initial parameters so that the governing equilibrium state can no longer be sustained and the system must find a new equilibrium that could have vastly different energy mix - of thermal, flow-kinetic and magnetic energies. In one such scenario, macro-scale flow kinetic, and magnetic energies abound in the final state. For the given multi-component plasma, we show that the flow (strongly Super-Alfv\'enic) kinetic energy is mostly carried by the small hot electron component. Under specific conditions, it is possible to generate strong macro-scale magnetic (velocity) field when all of the flow (magnetic) field energy is converted to the magnetic (velocity) field energy at the catastrophe. The analysis is applied to explain various observed characteristics of white dwarf (WD) systems, in particular, of the magnetic and dense/degenerate type.</description>

      <title>The Indian Pulsar Timing Array Data Release 2: I. Dataset and Timing Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) employs unique features of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to monitor dozens of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) millisecond pulsars (MSPs), simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz and the 1260-1460 MHz bands. This dual-band approach ensures that any frequency-dependent delays are accurately characterized, significantly improving the timing precision for pulsar observations, which is crucial for pulsar timing arrays. We present details of InPTA's second data release that involves 7 yrs of data on 27 IPTA MSPs. This includes sub-banded Times of Arrival (ToAs), Dispersion Measures (DM), and initial timing ephemerides for our MSPs. A part of this dataset, originally released in InPTA's first data release, is being incorporated into IPTA's third data release which is expected to detect and characterize nanohertz gravitational waves in the coming years. The entire dataset is reprocessed in this second data release providing some of the highest precision DM estimates so far and interesting solar wind related DM variations in some pulsars. This is likely to characterize the noise introduced by the dynamic inter-stellar ionised medium much better than the previous release thereby increasing sensitivity to any future gravitational wave search.</description>

      <title>Impact of $\Xi$-Hypernuclear Constraints on Relativistic Equation of States and Properties of Hyperon Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant uncertainties persist in describing the equation of state and internal structure of hyperon stars due to the limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying hyperon interactions. Constraining the interaction parameter space through a combination of the latest astronomical observations and hypernuclear physics experiments is therefore essential. In this study, we incorporate experimental constraints from $\Xi$ hypernuclear physics on top of $\Lambda$ hyperons considered in \citet{Sun2023APJ942.55}. Specifically, based on updated measurements of hyperon separation energies from $\Xi$ hypernuclear experiments, sets of $\Xi N$ effective interactions are constructed and a linear correlation between their scalar ($\sigma$) and vector ($\omega$) coupling strength ratios is proposed as a constraint derived from $\Xi$ hypernuclear physics. Together with experimental correlations and astronomical observational data, four types of analyses are performed to constrain hyperon-nucleon interactions and the properties of hyperon stars. Compared to the vector $\omega$ meson-hyperon coupling, the introduction of linear correlations in hypernuclear physics imposes a more substantial constraint on the scalar $\sigma$ meson-hyperon coupling, significantly enhancing its coupling strength and thereby ensuring the stiffness of the equation of state, highlighting the crucial role of hypernuclear studies in solving the hyperon puzzle problem. Consequently, a maximum mass of around $2M_{\odot}$ can be achieved with all five interactions considered in this study under the combined constraints from astronomical observations and nuclear physics. With more reliably estimated hyperon-nucleon contributions, the uncertainties in both the fractions and the threshold densities at which hyperons appear inside neutron stars are notably reduced, along with those in the mass-radius predictions.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme conditions within the supernova core, a high-temperature and high-density environment, create an ideal laboratory for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Of particular interest are low-energy supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to $g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.</description>

      <title>Frequently Used References For Atomic Data In X-ray Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate atomic physics reference data are a crucial requirement for analysis and interpretation of observed spectra, even more so for observations with high spectral resolution. This document provides a curated list of atomic physics references frequently used for plasma diagnostics in X-ray spectroscopy, outside of comprehensive plasma models that typically come with their own underlying atomic databases. The list includes references to physical constants, laboratory benchmarks, transition energies, position and line shapes of neutral fluorescence lines, radiative branching ratios, and commonly used notation for prominent transitions. Quick-look tables for transition energies in H-, He-, and Li-like ions and line positions and shapes for fluorescence lines in neutrals. The main focus is on K-shell transitions. For the H- and He-like tables, we cite state-of-the art calculations that we consider currently the best available reference energies, which are considered high accuracy and thus typically used for energy scale calibration in laboratory measurements. Omissions in these tables are due to the lack of availability in the chosen references, and are not a statement about the relevance of these lines. Due to their complex and highly source-dependent line shape, the atomic data for neutrals is of lower accuracy than that for the highly charged ions, and the best reference data for these line shapes typically consist of empirical models derived from very high-resolution laboratory measurements. The table for neutrals provided here is consistent with the reference used for the energy gain scale calibration of XRISM/Resolve. This document is meant to serve as a resource to help find relevant references and conveniently formatted overview tables. When making use of the information found in these papers, credit should be given to their original authors by citing the appropriate references.</description>

      <title>Impact of the large-scale cosmic web on the X-ray emitting circumgalactic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot circumgalactic medium (CGM), probed by X-ray observations, plays a central role in understanding gas flows that drive a galaxy's evolution. While CGM properties have been widely studied, the influence of a galaxy's large-scale cosmic environment on the hot gas content remains less explored. We investigate how the large-scale cosmic web affects the X-ray surface brightness (XSB) profiles of galaxies in the context of cosmological simulations. We use our novel IllustrisTNG-based lightcone, spanning $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.3$, first developed in our previous work, and generate self-consistent mock X-ray observations, using intrinsic gas cell information. We apply the filament finder DisPerSE on the galaxy distributions to identify the cosmic filaments within the lightcone. We classify central galaxies into five distinct large-scale environment (LSE) categories: clusters and massive groups, cluster outskirts, filaments, filament-void transition regions, and voids/walls. We find that the X-ray surface brightness profiles (XSB) of central galaxies of dark matter halos in filaments with $M_{\rm 200m} &gt;10^{12}\ M_\odot$ are X-ray brighter than those in voids and walls, with $20-45%$ deviations in the radial range of $\sim (0.3-0.5) R_{\rm 200m}$. We investigate the source of this enhancement and find that the filament galaxies show higher average gas densities, temperatures, and metallicities compared to voids/walls galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the large-scale cosmic environment is imprinted on the hot CGM's X-ray emission. Future theoretical work on studying the effect of assembly history, connectivity, and gas accretion on galaxies in filaments and voids would help to further our understanding of the impact of the environment on X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>GRB 221009A: Spectral signatures based on ALPs candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 221009A has posed a significant challenge to our current understanding of the mechanisms that produce TeV photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRB). On one hand, the Klein-Nishina (KN) effect of the inverse Compton scattering leads to less efficient energy losses of high-energy electrons. In the other hand, at a redshift of 0.151, the TeV spectrum of GRB 221009A undergoes significant absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). Therefore, the observation of a 13-TeV photon in this event implies the presence of enormous photon fluxes at the source, which the Synchrotron Self-Compton mechanism in external shocks cannot easily generate. As an alternative, some authors have suggested the possibility of converting the TeV-photons into Axion-like particles (ALPs) at the host galaxy, in order to avoid the effects of EBL absorption, and then reconverting them into photons within the Milky Way. While this solution relaxes the requirement of very high photon fluxes, the KN effect still poses a challenge. Previously, we have shown that the injections of ALPs could explain the observation of 13-TeV photons. Here, we include the energy dependence of the survival probability and the amount of energy carried to determine the ALP candidates which could potentially explain the TeV photons observed by LHAASO and their hard spectrum. We found that the allowed candidates are generally cluster around masses of $10^{-7}$ eV. We also considered different EBL models, for the one predicting larger attenuation tends to reject ALP candidates with the lowest coupling factor. For some hypothesis of EBL model, these candidates are found below a region of the parameter space in which, if detected, ALPs could account for all of the cold dark matter in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Observing the launch of an Eddington wind in the luminous Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The luminous narrow line Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 was the first non-BAL AGN to reveal a powerful ionized wind, based on early observations with ESA's XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory. Subsequent observations, mainly with XMM-Newton and the Japanese Suzaku Observatory, found such winds to be a common feature of luminous AGN. Typical outflow velocities of v ~ 0.1c and flow momenta mv ~ L_Edd /c are consistent with winds being launched by continuum driving from a disc when the local mass accretion rate is super-Eddington. Here we report the launch of a new, ultra-fast outflow component in PG1211+143, near the end of a 5-week XMM-Newton observing campaign, and discuss its origin in an ultra-fast {\it inflow} detected some 3 weeks earlier. We note that the inflow lasted for at least 3 days and delivered at least 10 Earth mass of fresh material into the innermost region of the source. While this mass by itself is insufficient to cause a complete inner disc restructuring - a prediction supported by lack of change in simultaneous UV fluxes - we suggest that a ring of matter at R ~ 20 R_g, located via its gravitational redshift (Pounds and Page 2024), was subsequently accreted, leading to the launch of a new outflow at a velocity of v ~ 0.27c.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 50%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. We estimate that at most ~20% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Muons, Pions, and Trapped Neutrinos on Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merger of two neutron stars probes dense matter in a hot, neutrino-trapped regime. In this work, we investigate how fully accounting for pions, muons, and muon-type neutrinos in the trapped regime may affect the outcome of the merger. By performing fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of merging neutron stars with equations of state to which we systematically add those different particle species, we aim to provide a detailed assessment of the impact of muons and pions on the merger and post-merger phase. In particular, we investigate the merger thermodynamics, mass ejection and gravitational wave emission. Our findings are consistent with previous expectations, that the inclusion of such microphysical degrees of freedom and finite temperature corrections leads to frequency shifts on the order of 100-200 Hz in the post-merger gravitational wave signal, relative to a fiducial cold nucleonic equation of state model.</description>

Abstract: We search for transient gamma-ray emission in the energy range from 0.1-10 GeV using data from the Fermi-LAT telescope in coincidence with magnetar flares. For our analysis, we look for coincidence with 15 distinct flares from 11 magnetars using three time windows of $\pm$ 1 day, $\pm$ 7 days, and $\pm$ 15 days. For 14 of these flares from 10 magnetars, we do not see any statistically significant gamma-ray emission. However, we see one possible gamma-ray flare from one magnetar, namely 1E 1048.1-5937, with combined significance of $4.4\sigma$, (after considering the look-elsewhere effect) observed after about 10 days from the start of the X-ray flare. However, this magnetar is located close to the galactic plane (with galactic latitude of -0.52\degree), and this signal could be caused by contamination due to diffuse flux from gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Pattern and Origin for the Extreme $\gamma$-ray Flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279: An Astrophysical Critical Damper?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a Gaussian process method to the extreme $\gamma$-ray flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279 to discover the variable patterns and then to investigate the physical origins of the giant flares. The kernels of stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO), the damped random-walk (DRW), and Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 are respectively used to describe the adaptive-binning $\gamma$-ray light curves of the two flares. Our findings show that both the extreme $\gamma$-ray flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279 clearly prefer the SHO kernel in the over-damped mode and the Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 kernel over the DRW kernel. The resulted SHO and Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 power spectral densities (PSDs) are the same for each object, with the index changing from -4 at high frequencies to 0 at low frequencies. The patterns of the two flares are both approaching the critical damping mode with the quality factor Q $\approx$ 0.4 (i.e., the damping ratio $\eta \approx$ 1.25), but with slightly different damping timescales. The characteristic timescale (corresponding to the broken frequency in the PSD) for 3C 454.3 is 2-3 days and 3-5 days for 3C 279. The variable patterns found here suggest that once the system responds to the energy injection disturbance, the release of the energy in the system is finished abruptly. The obtained timescale provides a constraint on the size of energy dissipation region for each source.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>Cygnus X-3 as semi-hidden PeVatron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 has been suggested for a long time to be a source of high-energy photons and neutrinos. In view of the increased sensitivity of current experiments, we examine the acceleration and interactions of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) in this binary system, assuming that the compact object is a black hole. Using a test-particle approach in a Monte-Carlo framework, we employ as the basic CR acceleration mechanisms magnetic reconnection or second-order Fermi and diffusive shock acceleration. We find that in all three scenarios CRs can be accelerated beyond PeV energies. High-energy photons and neutrinos are produced as secondaries in photo-hadronic interactions of CRs on X-ray photons and in the scattering on gas from the wind of the companion star. Normalising the predicted photon flux to the excess flux observed by LHAASO at energies above PeV in the direction of Cygnus X-3, a CR acceleration efficiency of $10^{-3}$ is sufficient to power the required CR luminosity. Our results suggest that the PeV photon flux from Cygnus X-3 could be in a bright phase significantly increased relative to the average flux of the last years.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo evaluations of gamma-ray and radio pulsar populations</title>

Abstract: Based on well-grounded Galactic neutron star populations formed from radio pulsar population syntheses of canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs), we use the latest Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4) to investigate the implications of proposed $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate the number of CPs and MSPs that would comprise the sample of pulsar-like unidentified sources (PLUIDs) in 4FGL-DR4. While radio beaming fractions were used to scale the sizes of the populations, when forming the mock 4FGL-DR4 samples, we make the simplifying assumption that all $\gamma-$ray pulsars are beaming towards the Earth. We then explore the observable outcomes of seven different $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Four of the models provide a good match to the observed number of PLUIDs, while three others significantly over-predict the number of PLUIDs. For these latter models, either the average beaming fraction of $\gamma-$ray pulsars is more like 25--50\%, or a revision in the luminosity scaling is required. Most of the radio detectable MSPs that our models predict as part of the PLUIDs within 4FGL-DR4 are, unsurprisingly, fainter than the currently observed sample and at larger dispersion measures. For CPs, in spite of an excellent match to the observed radio population, none of the $\gamma-$ray models we investigated could replicate the observed sample of 150 $\gamma-$ray CPs. Further work is required to understand this discrepancy. For both MSPs and CPs, we provide encouraging forecasts for targeted radio searches of PLUIDs from 4FGL-DR4 to elucidate the issues raised in this study.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination studies of ions relevant to kilonovae and non-LTE plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents calculations of rate coefficients, resonance strengths, and cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) of $\text{Y}^{+}$, $\text{Sr}^{+}$, $\text{Te}^{2+}$, and $\text{Ce}^{2+}$-low-charge ions relevant to kilonovae and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) plasmas. Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we computed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments. These DR rate coefficients and cross sections were calculated using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). The DR resonance features were identified by comparing theoretical resonance energies, estimated as the difference between NIST excitation energies and Dirac binding energies, with dominant autoionizing states confirmed through analysis of autoionization rates. Our results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at kilonova temperatures ($\sim 10^4$ K) and regulating charge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances significantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-$n$ Rydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels. Discrepancies with existing datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to minimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting spectroscopic observations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space Telescope data. We also put forward suitable candidates for experimental studies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measurements. The data presented here have the potential to refine models of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma modeling in astrophysical and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>A Heavy-Metal Scenario of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in astroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which we consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the novel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high metallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We investigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic interactions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this heavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax from modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data from the FAST and MeerKAT surveys has significantly increased the number of radio pulsars for which the polarization characteristics of their mean profiles have been determined in detail. This has allowed us to confirm earlier conclusions both about the nature of propagation of two orthogonal modes in the pulsar magnetospheres and about the mechanism of particle production in neutron star polar regions and their evolutionary features. We can now say with even greater confidence that mean profiles formed by the O-mode are significantly wider than those formed by the X-mode. Moreover, the observations confirm the validity of the classical Ruderman-Sutherland vacuum model of particle generation, as well as the evolution of the inclination angles of the magnetic axis to the rotation one in the direction of $90^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays as a signature of r-process producing supernovae: remnants and future Galactic explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of whether core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce rapid neutron capture process (r-process) elements and how future MeV gamma-ray observations could address this. Rare types of CCSNe characterized by substantial magnetic fields and rotation, known as magnetorotational supernovae (MR-SNe), are theoretically predicted to produce these elements, although direct observational evidence is lacking. We suggest that this critical question be addressed through the study of some of the eleven CCSN remnants located within 10 kpc, as well as through the detection of gamma-ray emission from a future Galactic supernova. We use a two-dimensional MR-SN model to estimate the expected gamma flux stemming from nuclear decays in the range of a few tens of keV to a few MeV. Our results indicate that an observation of Sn-126 (Sb-126) in a remnant stands out as a signature of an r-process-producing supernova. Since the neutron-rich conditions that lead to the production of the r-process could also enhance the production of Fe-60, the detection of substantial Fe-60 (Co-60) would be indicative of favorable conditions for the r-process. In the case of a future supernova explosion, when the evolution of the spectrum is studied over ten days to a few years, a rich picture emerges. At various epochs, second peak r-process isotopes such as Sb-125, I-131, Te-132, I-132 and La-140 produce gamma-ray signals that emerge above the background from explosive burning products and electron-positron annihilation. The weak r-process isotopes Nb-95, Ru-103, Rh-106 also have periods of prominence. While MR-SNe are predicted to have a relatively small main r-process contribution, third peak isotopes like Ir-194 could still be above next-generation MeV gamma instrument sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity evolution of spinning binaries and its dependence on the equation of state of the components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the eccentricity of an eccentric orbit with spinning components. We develop a prescription to express the evolving eccentricity in terms of reference eccentricity and frequency. For that purpose we considered the spins to be perpendicular to the orbital plane. Using this we found an analytical result for the contribution of spin in eccentricity evolution. As a result, we expressed orbital eccentricity in a series of reference eccentricity and gravitational wave frequency. The prescription developed here can easily be used to find arbitrarily higher-order contributions of reference eccentricity. With this we computed the eccentricity upto $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$. This result can be used to construct the waveforms of spinning compact objects in an eccentric orbit. Since, our expression depends on the spin induced quadrupole moments, we also study the impact of component properties on the eccentricity evolution through the quadrupole moment. We find for BNSs the evolution depends on the equation of state very mildly unless the NSs are subsolar mass. For subsolar mass NSs the deviations from BH case is comparatively larger and has equation of state dependence. For binary boson stars the deviations are comparatively larger across the mass values. We argue that it may affect our understanding of formation channels and their corresponding populations. We also argue that this can possibly be used as another tool to constrain exoticness of compact objects in a binary.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of Lepton Numbers in the Neutrino Sector Could Change the Prospects for Core Collapse Supernova Explosions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that interactions violating the conservation of lepton numbers in the neutrino sector could significantly alter the standard low entropy picture for the pre-supernova collapsing core of a massive star. A rapid neutrino-antineutrino equilibration leads to entropy generation and enhanced electron capture and, hence, a lower electron fraction than in the standard model. This would affect the downstream core evolution, the prospects for a supernova explosion, and the emergent neutrino signal. If realized by lepton-number-violating neutrino self-interactions (LNV $\nu$SI), the relevant mediator mass and coupling ranges can be probed by future accelerator-based experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Black holes: An Explanation for the Galaxy Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of increasing observational evidence supporting the existence of ultra-compact objects, we adopt the term astrophysical black hole to refer to any object having a huge mass confined within a sufficiently small region of spacetime. This terminology encompasses both the classical black hole solutions predicted by general relativity, as well as alternative compact objects that may not possess an event horizon. We propose models of Astrophysical Black holes (ABHs) without event horizons (EHs), as a more viable explanation for the long-term quenching phenomenon in galaxies. At the same time, the short-term quenching is explained here in terms of an efficient feedback expected in the models of stellar-mass astrophysical black holes (StMABHs). We have calculated the radiative flux from the disk in a general spherically symmetric metric background and used it to contrast the distinctive features of the BHs and ABHs scenarios. We demonstrate the relative ease of wind generation from the accretion disk surrounding an ABH without an event horizon, compared to a BH, and highlight the significant strength of these winds. The nature of the feedbacks arising from accretion onto a BH and an ABH in the `quasar' and `radio' modes are compared and some possible observational signatures of the StMABHs are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Prompt stellar and binary black hole mergers in tight triples: Insights from chemically homogeneous evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-period massive binary stars are predicted to undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), making them prime candidates for producing binary black holes (BBHs) that may merge within the age of the Universe. Most of these binaries have a tertiary companion, and here we explore how a nearby third body possibly influences this evolutionary channel. Our analysis combines analytic treatments of triple dynamics with insights from detailed stellar evolution models, focusing on the role of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism while also accounting for tidal and general relativistic apsidal precession. We examine the dynamics of triples at three critical evolutionary stages: the zero-age main sequence, shortly after the main sequence, and at the time of BBH formation. We find that, for triples having outer orbital periods less than 70 d(120 d), the inner binary can merge during(or after) the main-sequence stage, leading to a hydrogen-rich(helium-rich) stellar merger. If a stellar merger is avoided, the inner binary may eventually form a BBH. In mildly hierarchical triples, with outer periods of around 100 d, the tertiary component can trigger a rapid merger of the BBH on timescales comparable to the outer orbital period. Stellar tides play a crucial role in determining the fate of the inner binary in such tight triple systems, as they can suppress the perturbative effects of the third star. When tidal forces damp the oscillations induced by the tertiary, the BBH merger may occur soon after stellar collapse. Notably, these outcomes are not restricted to CHE binaries but can also apply to any BBH formed from stars in tight orbits. Mergers in these systems are characterized by the proximity of a tertiary companion and the presence of recently ejected gas, making them promising candidates for electromagnetic counterparts and gravitational-wave signals influenced by nearby tertiary objects.</description>

      <title>Chorus: Optimizing Synchrotron Transfer Coefficients with Weighted Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23113</link>

Abstract: Accurate synchrotron transfer coefficients are essential for modeling radiation processes in astrophysics. However, their current calculation methods face significant challenges. Analytical approximations of the synchrotron emissivity, absorptivity, and rotativity are limited to a few simple electron distribution functions that inadequately capture the complexity of cosmic plasmas. Numerical integrations of the transfer coefficients, on the other hand, are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations. In this paper, we present a new numerical method, Chorus, which evaluates the transfer coefficients by expressing any electron distribution function as a weighted sum of functions with known analytical formulas. Specifically, the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution function is employed as the basic component in the weighted sum. The Chorus leverages the additivity of transfer coefficients, drawing inspiration from an analogous approach that uses stochastic averaging to approximate the $\kappa$ distribution function. The key findings demonstrate median errors below $5\%$ for emissivity and absorptivity, with run times reduced from hours to milliseconds compared to first-principles numerical integrations. Validation against a single $\kappa$ distribution, as well as its extension to more complex distributions, confirms the robustness and versatility of the method. However, limitations are found, including increased errors at higher energies due to numerical precision constraints and challenges with rotativity calculations arising from fit function inaccuracies. Addressing these issues could further enhance the method's reliability. Our method has the potential to provide a powerful tool for radiative transfer simulations, where synchrotron emission is the main radiative process.</description>

      <title>Precision mass measurements around ${}^{84}$Mo rule out ZrNb cycle formation in the rapid proton-capture process at type I X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proton-capture ($rp$-) process is one of the primary, explosive thermonuclear burning processes that drive type I X-ray bursts. A possible termination of the $rp$-process at around ${}^{84}$Mo was previously suggested by the formation of a ZrNb cycle. We report here precision mass measurements at around ${}^{84}$Mo, which have concluded the possibility of the cycle. The experiment was conducted using the multi-reflection time-of-flight spectrograph at RIKEN RI Beam Factory, and the masses of ${}^{79}$Y, ${}^{83}$Nb, ${}^{84}$Mo, ${}^{88}$Ru, and an isomer in ${}^{78}$Y were measured. For ${}^{84}$Mo, and ${}^{88}$Ru, and the isomeric state of ${}^{78}$Y, their masses are experimentally determined for the first time with uncertainties of $\delta m \approx 20~{\rm keV/c^2}$. The mass precision of ${}^{79}$Y and ${}^{83}$Nb is improved to $13~{\rm keV/c^2}$ and $9.6~{\rm keV/c^2}$, respectively. The new $\alpha$-separation energy of ${}^{84}$Mo, 1.434(83) MeV, unambiguously rules out the possibility of forming the ZrNb cycle. The X-ray burst simulation with the new masses shows that our measurements effectively remove the large final abundance uncertainties in the $A=80-90$ mass region. The new mass values improve the prediction power for the composition of the nuclear ashes in X-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein--Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which are fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark--gluon plasma around the critical point at T=182 MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.22. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I--Love--Q--C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark--hadron interface is not large. Furthermore, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</description>
