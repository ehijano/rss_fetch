      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of American options with hybrid dividends via integral equations and the GIT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a semi-analytical method for pricing American options on assets (stocks, ETFs) that pay discrete and/or continuous dividends. The problem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price drops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional continuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in a number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial differential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation of the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by considering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and proportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as an integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the early exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the dividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which can struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy or performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive computational grids or complex backward induction steps.</description>

      <title>Learning the Exact SABR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan et al., whose accuracy deteriorates for high volatility, long maturities, and out-of-the-money options, admitting arbitrage. While machine learning approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation against the full spectrum of market conditions.
  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an unprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest rate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and extreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained via high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled shifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without any loss of generality.
  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility surfaces and Cap/Floor prices for any maturity and strike with negligible computational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results fully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a systematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest rate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus establishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for daily trading and risk management activities.</description>
