      <title>Risk spillovers between the BRICS and the U.S. staple grain futures markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines contemporaneous and lagged spillover effects in BRICS staple grain futures markets and their linkages with U.S. markets. The results show that contemporaneous spillovers dominate, while net spillovers are driven by lagged connectedness. Systemic risk is lower in intra-BRICS markets compared to those including the U.S., highlighting the U.S. grain market's significant influence. Brazilian and U.S. grains are key net spillover contributors, excluding U.S. rice, while South African staple grains act as major net receivers. Particularly, the spillover between soybeans is the strongest. The study also reveals heterogeneous impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Black Sea Grain Initiative on grain futures.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Technical Indicators on Machine Learning Models for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of random forest regression models enhanced with technical indicators for high-frequency stock price prediction. Using minute-level SPY data, we assessed 13 models that incorporate technical indicators such as Bollinger bands, exponential moving average, and Fibonacci retracement. While these models improved risk-adjusted performance metrics, they struggled with out-of-sample generalization, highlighting significant overfitting challenges. Feature importance analysis revealed that primary price-based features consistently outperformed technical indicators, suggesting their limited utility in high-frequency trading contexts. These findings challenge the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, identifying short-lived inefficiencies during volatile periods but its limited persistence across market regimes. The study emphasizes the need for selective feature engineering, adaptive modeling, and a stronger focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics to navigate the complexities of high-frequency trading environments.</description>

      <title>Shifting the yield curve for fixed-income and derivatives portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use granular regulatory data on euro interest rate swap trades between January 2021 and June 2023 to assess whether derivative positions of Italian banks can offset losses on their debt securities holdings should interest rates rise unexpectedly. At the aggregate level of the banking system, we find that a 100-basis-point upward shift of the yield curve increases on average the value of swaps by 3.65% of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), compensating in part for the losses of 2.64% and 5.98% of CET1 recorded on debt securities valued at fair value and amortised cost. Variation exists across institutions, with some bank swap positions playing an offsetting role and some exacerbating bond market exposures to interest rate risk. Nevertheless, we conclude that, on aggregate, Italian banks use swaps as hedging instruments to reduce their interest rate exposures, which improves their ability to cope with the recent tightening of monetary policy. Finally, we draw on our swap pricing model to conduct an extensive data quality analysis of the transaction-level information available to authorities, and we show that the errors in fitting value changes over time are significantly lower compared to those in fitting the values themselves.</description>

      <title>A semi-parametric dynamic conditional correlation framework for risk forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel multivariate semi-parametric framework for joint portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) forecasting. Unlike existing univariate semi-parametric approaches, the proposed framework explicitly models the dependence structure among portfolio asset returns through a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) parameterization. To estimate the model, a two-step procedure based on the minimization of a strictly consistent VaR and ES joint loss function is employed. This procedure allows to simultaneously estimate the DCC parameters and the portfolio risk factors. The performance of the proposed model in risk forecasting on various probability levels is evaluated by means of a forecasting study on the components of the Dow Jones index for an out-of-sample period from December 2016 to September 2021. The empirical results support effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to a variety of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Trust Dynamics and Market Behavior in Cryptocurrency: A Comparative Study of Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, trust is a critical yet underexplored factor shaping market behaviors and driving user preferences between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Despite its importance, trust remains challenging to measure, limiting the study of its effects on market dynamics. The collapse of FTX, a major CEX, provides a unique natural experiment to examine the measurable impacts of trust and its sudden erosion on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This pivotal event raised questions about the resilience of centralized trust systems and accelerated shifts toward decentralized alternatives. This research investigates the impacts of the FTX collapse on user trust, focusing on token valuation, trading flows, and sentiment dynamics. Employing causal inference methods, including Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Difference-in-Differences (DID), we reveal significant declines in WETH prices and NetFlow from CEXs to DEXs, signaling a measurable transfer of trust. Additionally, natural language processing methods, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, uncover the complexities of user responses, highlighting shifts from functional discussions to emotional fragmentation in Binance's community, while Uniswap's sentiment exhibits a gradual upward trend. Despite data limitations and external influences, the findings underscore the intricate interplay between trust, sentiment, and market behavior in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By bridging blockchain analytics, behavioral finance, and decentralized finance (DeFi), this study contributes to interdisciplinary research, offering a deeper understanding of distributed trust mechanisms and providing critical insights for future investigations into the socio-technical dimensions of trust in digital economies.</description>
