      <title>Model Selection in Panel Data Models: A Generalization of the Vuong Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the classical Vuong (1989) test to panel data models by employing modified profile likelihoods and the Kullback-Leibler information criterion. Unlike the standard likelihood function, the profile likelihood lacks certain regular properties, making modification necessary. We adopt a generalized panel data framework that incorporates group fixed effects for time and individual pairs, rather than traditional individual fixed effects. Applications of our approach include linear models with non-nested specifications of individual-time effects.</description>

      <title>Using SVM to Estimate and Predict Binary Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The support vector machine (SVM) has an asymptotic behavior that parallels that of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) for binary outcomes generated by a binary choice model (BCM), although it is not a QMLE. We show that, under the linear conditional mean condition for covariates given the systematic component used in the QMLE slope consistency literature, the slope of the separating hyperplane given by the SVM consistently estimates the BCM slope parameter, as long as the class weight is used as required when binary outcomes are severely imbalanced. The SVM slope estimator is asymptotically equivalent to that of logistic regression in this sense. The finite-sample performance of the two estimators can be quite distinct depending on the distributions of covariates and errors, but neither dominates the other. The intercept parameter of the BCM can be consistently estimated once a consistent estimator of its slope parameter is obtained.</description>

      <title>Realized Stochastic Volatility Model with Skew-t Distributions for Improved Volatility and Quantile Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13179v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of volatility and return quantiles is essential for evaluating financial tail risks such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall. This study proposes an extension of the traditional stochastic volatility model, termed the realized stochastic volatility model, that incorporates realized volatility as an efficient proxy for latent volatility. To better capture the stylized features of financial return distributions, particularly skewness and heavy tails, we introduce three variants of skewed t-distributions, two of which incorporate skew-normal components to flexibly model asymmetry. The models are estimated using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and applied to daily returns and realized volatilities from major U.S. and Japanese stock indices. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating both realized volatility and flexible return distributions substantially improves the accuracy of volatility and tail risk forecasts.</description>

      <title>Direct Bias-Correction Term Estimation for Average Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the direct bias-correction term for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE). Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the observations, where $X_i$ denotes $K$-dimensional covariates, $D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i$ denotes an outcome. In ATE estimation, $h_0(D_i, X_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$ is called the bias-correction term, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score. The bias-correction term is also referred to as the Riesz representer or clever covariates, depending on the literature, and plays an important role in construction of efficient ATE estimators. In this study, we propose estimating $h_0$ by directly minimizing the Bregman divergence between its model and $h_0$, which includes squared error and Kullback--Leibler divergence as special cases. Our proposed method is inspired by direct density ratio estimation methods and generalizes existing bias-correction term estimation methods, such as covariate balancing weights, Riesz regression, and nearest neighbor matching. Importantly, under specific choices of bias-correction term models and Bregman divergence, we can automatically ensure the covariate balancing property. Thus, our study provides a practical modeling and estimation approach through a generalization of existing methods.</description>

      <title>ScoreMatchingRiesz: Score Matching for Debiased Machine Learning and Policy Path Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose ScoreMatchingRiesz, a family of Riesz representer estimators based on score matching. The Riesz representer is a key nuisance component in debiased machine learning, enabling $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically efficient estimation of causal and structural targets via Neyman-orthogonal scores. We formulate Riesz representer estimation as a score estimation problem. This perspective stabilizes representer estimation by allowing us to leverage denoising score matching and telescoping density ratio estimation. We also introduce the policy path, a parameter that captures how policy effects evolve under continuous treatments. We show that the policy path can be estimated via score matching by smoothly connecting average marginal effect (AME) and average policy effect (APE) estimation, which improves the interpretability of policy effects.</description>
