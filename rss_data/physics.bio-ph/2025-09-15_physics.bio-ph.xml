      <title>What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</description>

      <title>Snakes combine vertical and lateral bending to traverse uneven terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.08474v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terrestrial locomotion requires generating appropriate ground reaction forces which depend on substrate geometry and physical properties. The richness of positions and orientations of terrain features in the 3-D world gives limbless animals like snakes that can bend their body versatility to generate forces from different contact areas for propulsion. Despite many previous studies of how snakes use lateral body bending for propulsion on relatively flat surfaces with lateral contact points, little is known about whether and how much snakes use vertical body bending in combination with lateral bending in 3-D terrain. This lack had contributed to snake robots being inferior to animals in stability, efficiency, and versatility when traversing complex 3-D environments. Here, to begin to elucidate this, we studied how the generalist corn snake traversed an uneven arena of blocks of random height variation 5 times its body height. The animal traversed the uneven terrain with perfect stability by propagating 3-D bending down its body with little transverse motion (11{\deg} slip angle). Although the animal preferred moving through valleys with higher neighboring blocks, it did not prefer lateral bending. Among body-terrain contact regions that potentially provide propulsion, 52% were formed by vertical body bending and 48% by lateral bending. The combination of vertical and lateral bending may dramatically expand the sources of propulsive forces available to limbless locomotors by utilizing various asperities available in 3-D terrain. Direct measurements of contact forces are necessary to further understand how snakes coordinate 3-D bending along the entire body via sensory feedback to propel through 3-D terrain. These studies will open a path to new propulsive mechanisms for snake robots, potentially increasing the performance and versatility in 3-D terrain.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Time Fluctuation Theorem and Thermodynamic Bound in Cooperative Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine (e.g., a motor protein or an enzyme) in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer constant, resulting in a breakdown of this expression. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis (a type of continuous-time Markov process with relevance to $\beta$-galactosidase and human glucokinase), as we explore this fluctuation theorem in cooperative biomolecular networks. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain surprising and concise results from complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be established for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this dramatic reduction is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of cooperative networks. The validity of this expression can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a unique signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, as well as the general form, revealing a thermodynamic bound on the kinetic branching ratio (a measure of directionality defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics for cooperative biomolecular machines.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Active viscoelastic condensates provide controllable mechanical anchor points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological materials must couple mechanical strength with the ability to rapidly self-assemble at a specific location. In particular, biomolecular condensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to resist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of condensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially drive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while resistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material properties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a continuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that viscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to deformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on growth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate strength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data from centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which rapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying how strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of scaffold material. Our results provide general design principles for other materials that must reconcile rapid, localised self-assembly with mechanical strength, such as focal adhesions.</description>

      <title>Modelling transcriptional silencing and its coupling to 3D genome organisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely up- or down-regulation of gene expression is crucial for cellular differentiation and function. While gene upregulation via transcriptional activators has been extensively investigated, gene silencing remains understudied, especially by modelling. This study employs 3D simulations to study the biophysics of a chromatin fibre where active transcription factors compete with repressors for binding to transcription units along the fibre, and investigates how different silencing mechanisms affect 3D chromatin structure and transcription. We examine three gene silencing feedback mechanisms: positive, negative, and neutral. These mechanisms capture different silencing pathways observed or proposed in biological systems. Our findings reveal that, whilst all mechanisms lead to a silencing transition, the signatures of this transition depend on the choice of the feedback. The latter controls the morphologies of the emergent 3D transcription factor clusters, the average gene expression and its variability, or gene noise, and the network of ensuing correlations between activities of neighbouring transcription units. These results provide insights into the biophysics of gene silencing, as well as into the interplay between transcriptional regulation and 3D genome organisation.</description>

      <title>Environmental force sensing helps robots traverse cluttered large obstacles using physical interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many applications require robots to move through complex 3-D terrain with large obstacles, such as self-driving, search and rescue, and extraterrestrial exploration. Although robots are already excellent at avoiding sparse obstacles, they still struggle in traversing cluttered large obstacles. To make progress, we need to better understand how to use and control the physical interaction with obstacles to traverse them. Forest floor-dwelling cockroaches can use physical interaction to transition between different locomotor modes to traverse flexible, grass-like beams of a large range of stiffness. Inspired by this, here we studied whether and how environmental force sensing helps robots make active adjustments to traverse cluttered large obstacles. We developed a physics model and a simulation of a minimalistic robot capable of sensing environmental forces during traversal of beam obstacles. Then, we developed a force-feedback control strategy, which estimated beam stiffness from the sensed contact force using the physics model. Then in simulation we used the estimated stiffness to control the robot to either stay in or transition to the more favorable locomotor modes to traverse. When beams were stiff, force sensing induced the robot to transition from a more costly pitch mode to a less costly roll mode, which helped the robot traverse with a higher success rate and less energy consumed. By contrast, if the robot simply pushed forward or always avoided obstacles, it would consume more energy, become stuck in front of beams, or even flip over. When the beams were flimsy, force sensing guided the robot to simply push across the beams. In addition, we demonstrated the robustness of beam stiffness estimation against body oscillations, randomness in oscillation, and uncertainty in position sensing. We also found that a shorter sensorimotor delay reduced energy cost of traversal.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction: a myopic self-avoiding fractional stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-squared displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha &lt; 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha &gt; 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions, the relation of our process to the ``true'' or myopic self-avoiding walk, as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.</description>
