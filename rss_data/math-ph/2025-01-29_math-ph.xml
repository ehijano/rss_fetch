      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics are systems of equations describing the evolution of macroscopic states in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. From generalized Onsager reciprocal relationships, one can formulate a class of hydrodynamics as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, Onsager gradient flows have been widely investigated in optimal transport-type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, namely hydrodynamical density manifolds. This paper studies geometric calculations in these hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate Levi-Civita connections, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport and then derive Riemannian and sectional curvatures on density manifolds. We last present closed formulas for sectional curvatures of density manifolds in one dimensional spaces, in which the sign of curvatures is characterized by the convexities of mobilities. For example, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures in zero-range models, such as independent particles, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Hamiltonian structures of the kinetic equation for soliton gas under polychromatic reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deepen the existence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian formalism for the El's kinetic equation for soliton gas under the polychromatic reduction for a class of interaction kernels. The nonlocality presented is related to semi-Riemannian metrics of constant curvature, conformally flat metrics and hypersurfaces in a pseudo-Euclidean space. These results generalise a previous one that Vergallo and Ferapontov obtained with local Hamiltonian operators. Some examples as the Korteweg-de Vries, the Lieb-Liniger and the separable cases are analysed.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Virtual bound states of the Pauli operator with an Aharonov-Bohm potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A maximal realisation of the two-dimensional Pauli operator, subject to Aharonov--Bohm magnetic field, is investigated. Contrary to the case of the Pauli operator with regular magnetic potentials, it is shown that both components of the Pauli operator are critical. Asymptotics of the weakly coupled eigenvalues, generated by electric (not necessarily self-adjoint) perturbations, are derived.</description>

      <title>Spectral square roots of the multivector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of multivector (MV) multiple square roots in real geometric Clifford algebras Cl(p,q) with symbolic coefficients is considered. The method to find multiple MV square roots that is based on R.Bott's periodicity table and matrix eigensystem in Cl(p,q) is proposed. The method can be applied to MV having both numerical and symbolic coefficients. In addition, method allows to determine the domain of the existence of thus obtained spectral square roots. A number of examples is presented for multivectors in low, p+q&lt;= 3, and higher dimensional Clifford algebras, including 4D (anti)-Euclidean space and relativistic Cl(1,3) and Cl(3,1) algebras. Tables of the required basis vectors for conversion of MV to Bott's matrix representation have been found from respective algebra idempotents using ideal theory and presented for real Clifford algebras in Appendix.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Extremal eigenvectors of sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of sparse random matrices, which includes the adjacency matrix of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph ${\bf G}(N,p)$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that the non-trivial edge eigenvectors are asymptotically jointly normal. The main ingredient of the proof is an algorithm that directly computes the joint eigenvector distributions, without comparisons with GOE. The method is applicable in general. As an illustration, we also use it to prove the normal fluctuation in quantum ergodicity at the edge for Wigner matrices. Another ingredient of the proof is the isotropic local law for sparse matrices, which at the same time improves several existing results.</description>

      <title>Linearization method and sharp thresholds for spherically symmetric multidimensional pressureless Euler-Poisson equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the question about the criterion of a singularity formation for radially symmetric solutions to the Cauchy problem for a fairly wide class of equations related to the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations can be reduced to the study of solutions to a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. In some cases, such a criterion can be obtained in terms of the initial data. In the remaining cases, it is possible to construct a simple numerical procedure, on the basis of which the question about preserving smoothness for any set of initial data can be solved.</description>

      <title>Higher-order chiral scalar from boundary reduction of 3d higher-spin gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a recently proposed covariant procedure to reduce the Chern-Simons action of three-dimensional higher-spin gravity to the boundary, resulting in a Lorentz covariant action for higher-order chiral scalars. After gauge-fixing, we obtain a higher-derivative action generalizing the $s=1$ Floreanini-Jackiw and $s=2$ Alekseev-Shatashvili actions to arbitrary spin $s$. For simplicity, we treat the case of general spin at the linearized level, while the full non-linear asymptotic boundary conditions are presented in component form for the $SL(3,\mathbb R)$ case. Finally, we extend the spin-3 linearized analysis to a background with non-trivial higher-spin charge and show that it has a richer structure of zero modes.</description>

      <title>Statistical solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation in 1D, via the randomly forced Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of statistically stationary solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation on a one-dimensional domain, with null Neumann boundary conditions. We deal directly with the equation in its real-valued formulation, without using any transform. To approximate the Schr\"odinger map equation, we employ the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation. By a limiting procedure \`a la Kuksin, we establish existence of a random initial datum, whose distribution is preserved under the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Among other properties, the corresponding statistically stationary solution is proved to exhibit non-trivial dynamics in space and time and to be genuinely random. With an analogous argument, we prove the existence of stationary solutions to a stochastic Schr\"odinger map equation. We discuss the relationship between the statistically stationary solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation, the binormal curvature flow and the cubic non-linear Schr\"odinger equation. Additionally, we prove the existence of statistically stationary solutions to the binormal curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Perceptrons, Number Partitioning and Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric binary perceptron ($\mathrm{SBP}_{\kappa}$) problem with parameter $\kappa : \mathbb{R}_{\geq1} \to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $\mathbf{A} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n \times m}$ as input where $m \geq n$, output a vector $\mathbf{x} \in \{-1,1\}^m$ such that $$|| \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} ||_{\infty} \leq \kappa(m/n) \cdot \sqrt{m}~.$$ The number partitioning problem ($\mathrm{NPP}_{\kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps.
  In this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{SBP}$, for large $n$, the best that efficient algorithms have been able to achieve is $\kappa(x) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{x})$ (Bansal and Spencer, Random Structures and Algorithms 2020), which is a far cry from the statistical bound. The problem has been extensively studied in the TCS and statistics communities, and Gamarnik, Kizildag, Perkins and Xu (FOCS 2022) conjecture that Bansal-Spencer is tight: namely, $\kappa(x) = \widetilde{\Theta}(1/\sqrt{x})$ is the optimal value achieved by computationally efficient algorithms. We prove their conjecture assuming the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{NPP}$, Karmarkar and Karp's classical differencing algorithm achieves $\kappa(m) = 2^{-O(\log^2 m)}~.$ We prove that Karmarkar-Karp is nearly tight: namely, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve $\kappa(m) = 2^{-\Omega(\log^3 m)}$, once again assuming the worst-case subexponential hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices to within a subexponential factor.</description>

      <title>On the subcritical self-catalytic branching Brownian motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-catalytic branching Brownian motions (SBBM) are extensions of the classical one-dimensional branching Brownian motions by incorporating pairwise branchings catalyzed by the intersection local times of the particle pairs. These processes naturally arise as the moment duals of certain reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by multiplicative space-time white noise. For the subcritical case of the catalytic branching mechanism, we construct the SBBM allowing an infinite number of initial particles. Additionally, we establish the coming down from infinity (CDI) property for these systems and characterize their CDI rates.</description>

      <title>Networks of neural networks: more is different</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</description>

      <title>Jordan-H\"older property for shifted quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16859v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that finite length representations of shifted quantum affine algebras in category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}}$ are stable by fusion product. This implies that in the topological Grothendieck ring $K_0(\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}})$ the Grothendieck group of finite length representations forms a non-topological subring. We also conjecture this subring is isomorphic to the cluster algebra discovered in arXiv:2401.04616. In the course of our proofs, we establish that any simple representation in category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}}$ descends to a truncation, for certain truncation parameters as conjectured in arXiv:2010.06996 in terms of Langlands dual $q$-characters.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation via Time-Dependent Velocity Fields: Acceleration and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by mixing processes in analytical laboratories, this work investigates enhanced dissipation in non-autonomous flows. Specifically, we study the evolution of concentrations governed by the advection-diffusion equation, where the velocity field is modelled as the product of a shear flow (with simple critical points) and a time-dependent function $\xi(t)$. The main objective of this paper is to derive explicit, quantitative estimates for the energy decay rates, which are shown to depend sensitively on the properties of $\xi$. We identify a class of time-dependent functions $\xi$ that are bounded above and below by increasing functions of time. For this class, we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases (e.g., when $\xi \equiv 1$, as in Coti Zelati and Gallay (2023)). Additionally, we explore enhanced dissipation in the context of intermittent flows, where the velocity fields may be switched on and off over time. In these cases, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows but with modified constants. To illustrate our results, we analyse two prototypical intermittent flows: one that exhibits a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase, and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase. For the second, we derive the corresponding dissipation rate using a gluing argument. Both results are achieved through the application of the hypocoercivity framework (\`a la Bedrossian and Coti Zelati (2017)), adapted to an augmented functional with time-dependent weights. These weights are designed to dynamically counteract the potential growth of $\xi$, ensuring robust estimates for the energy decay.</description>

      <title>Stochastic multisymplectic PDEs and their structure-preserving numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct stochastic multisymplectic systems by considering a stochastic extension to the variational formulation of multisymplectic partial differential equations proposed in [Hydon, {\it Proc. R. Soc. A}, 461, 1627--1637, 2005]. The stochastic variational principle implies the existence of stochastic $1$-form and $2$-form conservation laws, as well as conservation laws arising from continuous variational symmetries via a stochastic Noether's theorem. These results are the stochastic analogues of those found in deterministic variational principles. Furthermore, we develop stochastic structure-preserving collocation methods for this class of stochastic multisymplectic systems. These integrators possess a discrete analogue of the stochastic $2$-form conservation law and, in the case of linear systems, also guarantee discrete momentum conservation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through their application to stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations featuring either stochastic transport or stochastic dispersion.</description>

      <title>Local decay and asymptotic profile for the damped wave equation in the asymptotically Euclidean setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove local decay estimates for the wave equation in the asymptotically Euclidean setting. In even dimensions we go beyond the optimal decay by providing the large time asymptotic profile, given by a solution of the free wave equation. In odd dimensions, we improve the best known estimates. In particular, we get a decay rate that is better than what would be the optimal decay in even dimensions. The analysis mainly relies on a comparison of the corresponding resolvent with the resolvent of the free problem for low frequencies. Moreover, all the results hold for the damped wave equation with short range absorption index.</description>

      <title>Two measurement bases are asymptotically informationally complete for any pure state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in quantum information theory is to find how many measurement bases are required to obtain the full information of a quantum state. While a minimum of four measurement bases is typically required to determine an arbitrary pure state, we prove that for any states generated by finite-depth Clifford + T circuits, just two measurement bases are sufficient. More generally, we prove that two measurement bases are informationally complete for determining algebraic pure states whose state-vector elements represented in the computational basis are algebraic numbers. Since any pure state can be asymptotically approximated by a sequence of algebraic states with arbitrarily high precision, our scheme is referred to as asymptotically informationally complete for pure state tomography. Furthermore, existing works mostly construct the measurements using entangled bases. So far, the best result requires $O(n)$ local measurement bases for $n$-qubit pure-state tomography. Here, we show that two measurement bases that involve polynomial elementary gates are sufficient for uniquely determining sparse algebraic states. Moreover, we prove that two local measurement bases, involving single-qubit local operations only, are informationally complete for certain algebraic states, such as GHZ-like and W-like states. Besides, our two-measurement-bases scheme remains valid for mixed states with certain types of noises. We numerically test the uniqueness of the reconstructed states under two (local) measurement bases with and without measurement and depolarising types of noise. Our scheme provides a theoretical guarantee for pure state tomography in the fault-tolerant quantum computing regime.</description>

      <title>Useful trick to compute correlation functions of composite operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general, in gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. As we recently demonstrated in the context of the $U\left(1\right)$ and $SU\left(2\right)$ Higgs models \cite{Dudal:2019pyg,Dudal:2020uwb,Maas:2020kda}, correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators exhibit very nice properties. Besides the well-known gauge independence, they do not present unphysical cuts, and their K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann representations are positive, at least perturbatively. Despite all these interesting features, they are not employed as much as elementary fields, mainly due to the additional complexities involved in their computation and renormalization. In this article, we present a useful trick to compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the traditional algorithms used to compute correlation functions of elementary fields.</description>

      <title>The Pauli-Villars regularised free energy of Dirac's vacuum in purely magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac vacuum is a non-linear polarisable medium rather than an empty space. This non-linear behaviour starts to be significant for extremely large electromagnetic fields such as the magnetic field on the surface of certain neutron stars. Even though the null temperature case was deeply studied in the past decades, the problem at non-zero temperature needs to be better understood. In this work, we present the first rigorous derivation of the one-loop effective magnetic Lagrangian at positive temperature, a non-linear functional describing the free energy of the Dirac vacuum in a classical magnetic field. After introducing our model, we properly define the free energy functional using the Pauli-Villars regularisation technique in order to remove the worst ultraviolet divergences, which represent a well known issue of the theory. The study of the properties of this functional is addressed before focusing on the limit of slowly varying classical magnetic fields. In this regime, we prove the convergence of this functional to the Euler-Heisenberg formula with thermal corrections, recovering the effective Lagrangian first derived by Dittrich in 1979.</description>

      <title>Spectral Determinants of Almost Equilateral Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kirchoff's matrix tree theorem of 1847 connects the number of spanning trees of a graph to the spectral determinant of the discrete Laplacian [16]. Recently an analogue was obtained for quantum graphs relating the number of spanning trees to the spectral determinant of a Laplacian acting on functions on a metric graph with standard (Neumann-like) vertex conditions [14]. This result holds for quantum graphs where the edge lengths are close together. A quantum graph where the edge lengths are all equal is called equilateral. Here we consider equilateral graphs where we perturb the length of a single edge (almost equilateral graphs). We analyze the spectral determinant of almost equilateral complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and circulant graphs. This provides a measure of how fast the spectral determinant changes with respect to changes in an edge length. We apply these results to estimate the width of a window of edge lengths where the connection between the number of spanning trees and the spectral determinant can be observed. The results suggest the connection holds for a much wider window of edge lengths than is required in [14].</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation in a product-type random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a last passage percolation model in dimension $1+1$ with potential given by the product of a spatial i.i.d. potential with symmetric bounded distribution and an independent i.i.d. in time sequence of signs. We assume that the density of the spatial potential near the edge of its support behaves as a power, with exponent $\kappa&gt;-1$. We investigate the linear growth rate of the actions of optimal point-to-point lazy random walk paths as a function of the path slope and describe the structure of the resulting shape function. It has a corner at $0$ and, although its restriction to positive slopes cannot be linear, we prove that it has a flat edge near $0$ if $\kappa&gt;0$.
  For optimal point-to-line paths, we study their actions and locations of favorable edges that the paths tends to reach and stay at. Under an additional assumption on the time it takes for the optimal path to reach the favorable location, we prove that appropriately normalized actions converge to a limiting distribution that can be viewed as a counterpart of the Tracy-Widom law. Since the scaling exponent and the limiting distribution depend only on the parameter $\kappa$, our results provide a description of a new universality class.</description>

      <title>Is every triangle a trajectory of an elliptical billiard?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named "Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of quasisymmetric stellarators and their coil sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We augment the `QUAsi-symmetric Stellarator Repository' (QUASR) to include vacuum field stellarators with quasihelical symmetry using a globalized optimization workflow. The database now has almost 370,000 quasisaxisymmetry and quasihelically symmetric devices along with coil sets, optimized for a variety of aspect ratios, rotational transforms, and discrete rotational symmetries. This paper outlines a couple of ways to explore and characterize the data set. We plot devices on a near-axis quasisymmetry landscape, revealing close correspondence to this predicted landscape. We also use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data so that it can easily be visualized in two or three dimensions. Principal component analysis also gives a mechanism to compare the new devices here to previously published ones in the literature. We are able to characterize the structure of the data, observe clusters, and visualize the progression of devices in these clusters. The topology of the data is governed by the interplay of the design constraints and valleys of the quasisymmetry objective. These techniques reveal that the data has structure, and that typically one, two or three principal components are sufficient to characterize it. The latest version of QUASR is archived at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10050655 and can be explored online at quasr.flatironinstitute.org.</description>

      <title>Jacobi convolution series for Petrov-Galerkin scheme and general fractional calculus of arbitrary order over finite interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, general fractional calculus was introduced by Kochubei (2011) and Luchko (2021) as a further generalisation of fractional calculus, where the derivative and integral operator admits arbitrary kernel. Such a formalism will have many applications in physics and engineering, since the kernel is no longer restricted. We first extend the work of Al-Refai and Luchko (2023) on finite interval to arbitrary orders. Followed by, developing an efficient Petrov-Galerkin scheme by introducing Jacobi convolution series as basis functions. A notable property of this basis function, the general fractional derivative of Jacobi convolution series is a shifted Jacobi polynomial. Thus, with a suitable test function it results in diagonal stiffness matrix, hence, the efficiency in implementation. Furthermore, our method is constructed for any arbitrary kernel including that of fractional operator, since, its a special case of general fractional operator.</description>

Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation, i.e., particles experiencing inertia. We introduce an associated equation of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which can be interpreted as stochastic version of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. We show a dichotomy previously known for purely diffusive systems carries over to the hypoelliptic setting considered here: Solutions exist only for suitable atomic initial data, but not for smooth initial data. The class of systems covered includes several models of active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

Abstract: We review some important facts about the structure of tensor products of finite dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. This is done from the elementary standpoint of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras in the scope of a masters thesis. We set the focus on drawing the line to the finite dimensional representation theory of quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, the theory of q-characters, and introduce the so called snake modules together with their character formula.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associated curvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional (infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c}$. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft' three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashed manifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>
