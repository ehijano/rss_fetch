      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>

      <title>Complex line fields on almost-complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linearly independent complex line fields on almost-complex manifolds, which is a topic of long-standing interest in differential topology and complex geometry. A necessary condition for the existence of such fields is the vanishing of appropriate virtual Chern classes. We prove that this condition is also sufficient for the existence of one, two, or three linearly independent complex line fields over certain manifolds. More generally, our results hold for a wider class of complex bundles over CW complexes.</description>

      <title>Simplicial vs. cubical spheres, polyhedral products and the Nevo-Petersen conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a Murai sphere is flag if and only if it is a nerve complex of a flag nestohedron and classify all the polytopes arising in this way. Our classification implies that flag Murai spheres satisfy the Nevo-Petersen conjecture on $\gamma$-vectors of flag homology spheres. We continue by showing that a Bier sphere is minimally non-Golod if and only if it is a nerve complex of a truncation polytope different from a simplex and classify all the polytopes arising in this way. Finally, the notion of a cubical Bier sphere is introduced based on the polyhedral product construction, and we study combinatorial and geometrical properties of these cubical complexes.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. Based on this framework, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only outperforms traditional bond-orientational order parameters in phase classification tasks but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Twisting of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss what topological data must be provided to define topologically twisted partition functions of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric field theories. The original example of Donaldson-Witten theory depends only on the diffeomorphism type of the spacetime and 't Hooft fluxes (characteristic classes of background gerbe connections, a.k.a. "one-form symmetry connections.") The example of $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theories shows that, in general, the twisted partition functions depend on further topological data. We describe topological twisting for general four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and argue that the topological partition functions depend on (a): the diffeomorphism type of the spacetime, (b): the characteristic classes of background gerbe connections and (c): a "generalized spin-c structure," a concept we introduce and define. The main ideas are illustrated with both Lagrangian theories and class $\mathcal{S}$ theories. In the case of class $\mathcal{S}$ theories of $A_1$ type, we note that the different $S$-duality orbits of a theory associated with a fixed UV curve $C_{g,n}$ can have different topological data.</description>

      <title>Isotopy classification of Morse polynomials of degree 3 in ${\mathbb R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enumerate all isotopy classes of Morse polynomials ${\mathbb R}^3 \to {\mathbb R}^1$ of degree three with non-singular principal homogeneous part, in particular prove that there are exactly 37 of them. We also count all 2258 isotopy classes of {\em strictly} Morse polynomials ${\mathbb R}^3 \to {\mathbb R}^1$ of degree three with the maximal (equal to eight) number of real critical points.
  One of main tools of this calculation is a combinatorial computer program formalizing Morse surgeries, local monodromy and the Picard-Lefschetz theory, which I hereby promote and recommend to the readers.</description>

      <title>On the formality of nearly K\"ahler manifolds and of Joyce's examples in $G_2$-holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.10915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a prominent conjecture (relating Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology) that all simply-connected compact manifolds of special holonomy should be formal spaces, i.e., their rational homotopy type should be derivable from their rational cohomology algebra already -- an as prominent as particular property in rational homotopy theory. Special interest now lies on exceptional holonomy $G_2$ and $Spin(7)$. In this article we provide a method of how to confirm that the famous Joyce examples of holonomy $G_2$ indeed are formal spaces; we concretely exert this computation for one example which may serve as a blueprint for the remaining Joyce examples (potentially also of holonomy $Spin(7)$). These considerations are preceded by another result identifying the formality of manifolds admitting special structures: we prove the formality of nearly K\"ahler manifolds. A connection between these two results can be found in the fact that both "special holonomy" and "nearly K\"ahler" naturally generalize compact K\"ahler manifolds, whose formality is a classical and celebrated theorem by Deligne-Griffiths-Morgan-Sullivan.</description>

      <title>Interval Multiplicities of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any persistence module $M$ over a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, and any interval $I$ in $\mathbf{P}$, we give a formula of the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$ of the interval module $V_I$ in the indecomposable decomposition of $M$ in terms of structure linear maps of the module $M$. This makes it possible to compute the maximal interval-decomposable direct summand of $M$, which gives us a way to decide whether $M$ is interval-decomposable or not. Moreover, the formula tells us essential morphisms of $\mathbf{P}$ that are necessary to compute the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$. This suggests us some poset morphism $\zeta \colon Z \to \mathbf{P}$ such that the induced restriction functor $R \colon \operatorname{mod} \mathbf{P} \to \operatorname{mod} Z$ has the property that the multiplicity $d:= d_{R(M)}(R(V_I))$ is equal to $d_M(V_I)$. If $Z$ can be taken as a poset of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$ as in the bipath case, then the calculation of the multiplicity $d$ can be done more efficiently, starting from the filtration level of topological spaces. Thus this even makes it unnecessary to compute the structure linear maps of $M$.</description>
