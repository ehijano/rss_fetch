      <title>Central Configurations with Dihedral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an application of the representation theory for the dihedral groups, we study the symmetric central configurations in the n-body problem where $n$ equal masses are placed at the vertices of a regular $n$-gon. Since the Hessian matrices at these configurations are typically very large, particularly when $n$ is large, computations of their eigenvalues present a challenging problem. However, by decomposing the action of the dihedral groups into irreducible representations, we show that the Hessians can be simplified to a block-diagonal matrix with small blocks, of the sizes at most 2*2. This is due to the fact that the action of a dihedral group can be represented as a block-diagonal matrix with small irreducible blocks. In the end, the eigenvalues can be explicitly obtained by simply computing eigenvalues of these small block matrices.</description>

      <title>High order homoclinic tangencies of corank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that in the space of $C^r$ maps $(r=2,\ldots,\infty,\omega)$ of a smooth manifold of dimension at least 4 there exist open regions where maps with infinitely many corank-2 homoclinic tangencies of all orders are dense. The result is applied to show the existence of maps with universal two-dimensional dynamics, i.e. maps whose iterations approximate the dynamics of every map of a two-dimensional disk with an arbitrarily good accuracy. We show that maps with universal two-dimensional dynamics are $C^r$-generic in the regions under consideration.</description>

      <title>Maximal tori in infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems: a Renormalization Group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of infinite-dimensional invariant tori in a mechanical system of infinitely many rotators weakly interacting with each other. We consider explicitly interactions depending only on the angles, with the aim of discussing in a simple case the analyticity properties to be required on the perturbation of the integrable system in order to ensure the persistence of a large measure set of invariant tori with finite energy. The proof we provide of the persistence of the invariant tori implements the Renormalization Group scheme based on the tree formalism -- i.e. the graphical representation of the solutions of the equations of motion in terms of trees -- which has been widely used in finite-dimensional problems. The method is very effectual and flexible: it naturally extends, once the functional setting has been fixed, to the infinite-dimensional case with only minor technical-natured adaptations.</description>

      <title>Phase-Amplitude Description of Stochastic Oscillators: A Parameterization Method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameterization method (PM) provides a broad theoretical and numerical foundation for computing invariant manifolds of dynamical systems. PM implements a change of variables in order to represent trajectories of a system of ordinary differential equations ``as simply as possible." In this paper we pursue a similar goal for stochastic oscillator systems. For planar nonlinear stochastic systems that are ``robustly oscillatory", we find a change of variables through which the dynamics are as simple as possible $\textit{in the mean}$. We prove existence and uniqueness of a deterministic vector field, the trajectories of which capture the local mean behavior of the stochastic oscillator. We illustrate the construction of such an ``effective vector field" for several examples, including a limit cycle oscillator perturbed by noise, an excitable system derived from a spiking neuron model, and a spiral sink with noise forcing (2D Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). The latter examples comprise contingent oscillators that would not sustain rhythmic activity without noise forcing. Finally, we exploit the simplicity of the dynamics after the change of variables to obtain the effective diffusion constant of the resulting phase variable, and the stationary variance of the resulting amplitude (isostable) variable.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Behavior of a Stochastic Epidemiological Model: Stationary Distribution and Extinction of a SIRS Model with Stochastic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a new epidemiological model of SIRS with stochastic perturbations. The primary objective is to establish the existence of a unique non-negative nonlocal solution. Using the basic reproduction number $\mathscr{R}_0$ derived from the associated deterministic model, we demonstrate the existence of a stationary distribution in the stochastic model. In addition, we study the fluctuation of the unique solution of the deterministic problem around the disease-free equilibrium under certain conditions. In particular, we reveal scenarios where random effects induce disease extinction, contrary to the persistence predicted by the deterministic model. The theoretical insights are complemented by numerical simulations, which provide further validation of our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Phi = \{\phi_e\}_{e\in E}$ be a finitely irreducible conformal graph directed Markov system (CGDMS) with symbolic representation $E_A^{\infty}$ and limit set $J$. Under a mild condition on the system, we give a multifractal analysis of level sets of Birkhoff averages with respect to Hausdorff dimension for a large family of functions. We then apply these results to a few examples in the case of both $E$ finite and $E$ countably infinite.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Fourier Decay For Patterson-Sullivan Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Fourier transform of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to convex cocompact groups of isometries of real hyperbolic space decays polynomially quickly at infinity. The proof is based on the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in prior work of the author, combined with a method based on dynamical self-similarity for ruling out the sparse set of potential frequencies where the Fourier transform can be large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a theory of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to coarse cocycles of convergence groups. This framework includes Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to the Busemann cocycle on the geodesic boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces and Patterson-Sullivan measures on flag manifolds associated to Anosov (or more general transverse) subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, as well as more examples. Under some natural geometric assumptions on the coarse cocycle, we prove existence, uniqueness, and ergodicity results.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow. Moreover, it is strongly mixing. We obtain a higher rank analogue of this theorem. Let $\Gamma$ be a relatively Anosov subgroup of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. For every linear form $\psi$ tangent to the growth indicator of $\Gamma$, there is a canonical one-dimensional flow space $(\Omega_\psi, m_\psi, \phi_t)$ such that the non-wandering set $\Omega_\Gamma$ for the diagonal flow is a $\ker\psi$-vector bundle over $\Omega_\psi$ and the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\Omega_\Gamma$ is the product $m_\psi \otimes \mathrm{Leb}_{\ker\psi}$. We show that $m_{\psi}$ is of finite measure and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the flow $\{\phi_t\}$. Moreover, $(\Omega_{\psi}, m_{\psi}, \phi_t)$ is strongly mixing. The main ingredient is our construction of a reparameterization of the flow $\{\phi_t\}$ on $\Omega_{\psi}$ by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning cusp space of $\Gamma$, which has an exponentially expanding property along unstable foliations.</description>

      <title>State-Space Systems as Dynamic Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic framework to study the dependence structure induced by deterministic discrete-time state-space systems between input and output processes is introduced. General sufficient conditions are formulated under which output processes exist and are unique once an input process has been fixed, a property that in the deterministic state-space literature is known as the echo state property. When those conditions are satisfied, the given state-space system becomes a generative model for probabilistic dependences between two sequence spaces. Moreover, those conditions guarantee that the output depends continuously on the input when using the Wasserstein metric. The output processes whose existence is proved are shown to be causal in a specific sense and to generalize those studied in purely deterministic situations. The results in this paper constitute a significant stochastic generalization of sufficient conditions for the deterministic echo state property to hold, in the sense that the stochastic echo state property can be satisfied under contractivity conditions that are strictly weaker than those in deterministic situations. This means that state-space systems can induce a purely probabilistic dependence structure between input and output sequence spaces even when there is no functional relation between those two spaces.</description>

Abstract: Pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectizations, as introduced by Hofer in 1993, and then developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder, have brought new insights to Hamiltonian dynamics, providing new approaches to some classical questions in Celestial Mechanics. This short survey presents some recent developments in Reeb dynamics based on the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectizations, focusing on transverse foliations near critical energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Early detection of disease outbreaks and non-outbreaks using incidence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting the occurrence and absence of novel disease outbreaks is essential for disease management. Here, we develop a general model, with no real-world training data, that accurately forecasts outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We propose a novel framework, using a feature-based time series classification method to forecast outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We tested our methods on synthetic data from a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model for slowly changing, noisy disease dynamics. Outbreak sequences give a transcritical bifurcation within a specified future time window, whereas non-outbreak (null bifurcation) sequences do not. We identified incipient differences in time series of infectives leading to future outbreaks and non-outbreaks. These differences are reflected in 22 statistical features and 5 early warning signal indicators. Classifier performance, given by the area under the receiver-operating curve, ranged from 0.99 for large expanding windows of training data to 0.7 for small rolling windows. Real-world performances of classifiers were tested on two empirical datasets, COVID-19 data from Singapore and SARS data from Hong Kong, with two classifiers exhibiting high accuracy. In summary, we showed that there are statistical features that distinguish outbreak and non-outbreak sequences long before outbreaks occur. We could detect these differences in synthetic and real-world data sets, well before potential outbreaks occur.</description>

      <title>Crossed products of dynamical systems; rigidity Vs. strong proximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X, \Gamma)$, the corresponding crossed product $C^*$-algebra $C(X) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$ is called reflecting, when every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma) &lt; \mathcal{A} &lt; C(X) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$ is of the form $\mathcal{A} = C(Y) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$, corresponding to a dynamical factor $X \rightarrow Y$. It is called almost reflecting if $\mathbb{E}(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{A}$ for every such $\mathcal{A}$. These two notions coincide for groups admitting the approximation property (AP). Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary convergence group or a lattice in $\text{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \ge 2$. We show that any uniformly rigid system $(X,\Gamma)$ is almost reflecting. In particular, this holds for any equicontinuous action. In the von Neumann setting, for the same groups $\Gamma$ and any uniformly rigid system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu, \Gamma)$ the crossed product algebra $L^{\infty}(X,\mu) \rtimes \Gamma$ is reflecting. An inclusion of algebras $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{B}$ is called $\textit{minimal ambient}$ if there are no intermediate algebras. As a demonstration of our methods, we construct examples of minimal ambient inclusions with various interesting properties in the $C^*$ and the von Neumann settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the challenges of image super-resolution and noise reduction, which are crucial for enhancing the quality of images derived from low-resolution or noisy data. We compared and assessed several approaches for upgrading low-resolution images to higher resolutions and for eliminating unwanted noise, all while maintaining the essential characteristics of the original images and recovering images from poor quality or damaged data using deep learning models. Our analysis and the experimental outcomes on image quality metrics indicate that the EDCNN neural network model, enhanced with pretrained weights, significantly outperforms other methods with a Train PSNR of 31.215, a Valid PSNR of 29.493, and a Test PSNR of 31.6632.</description>

The controls modify the strength of connections in the network, rather than influencing opinions directly, with the overall goal of steering the population towards a target opinion. This requires that the social network remains sufficiently connected, the population does not break into separate opinion clusters, and that the target opinion remains accessible. We present several approaches to addressing these challenges, considering questions of controllability, instantaneous control and optimal control. Each of these approaches provides a different view on the complex relationship between opinion and network dynamics and raises interesting questions for future research.</description>

      <title>An efficient solution procedure for solving higher-codimension Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solving real world systems for higher-codimension bifurcation problems, one often faces the difficulty in computing the normal form or the focus values associated with generalized Hopf bifurcation, and the normal form with unfolding for higher-codimension Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. The difficulty is not only coming from the teadious symbolic computation of focus values, but also due to the restriction on the system parameters, which frequently leads to failure of the conventional approach used in the computation even for simple $2$-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we use a simple 2-dimensional epidemic model, for which the conventional approach fails in analyzing the stability of limit cycles arising from Hopf bifurcation, to illustrate how our method can be efficiently applied to determine the codimension of Hopf bifurcation. Further, we apply the simplest normal form theory to consider codimension-3 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation and present an efficient one-step transformation approach, compared with the classical six-step transformation approach to demonstrate the advantage of our method.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quadratic modeling in the Loewner framework from input-output time-domain measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a purely data-driven method that uses the Loewner framework (LF) along with nonlinear optimization techniques to infer quadratic with affine control dynamical systems that admit Volterra series (VS) representations from input-output (i/o) time-domain measurements. The proposed method extensively employs optimization tools for interpolating the symmetric generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) derived in the VS framework. The GFRF estimations are obtained from the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude) of the quasi-steady state system response under harmonic excitation. Appropriate treatment of these measurements under the developed framework allows the identification of low-order quadratic state-space models with non-trivial stable equilibria, such as in the Lorenz '63 forced system. We thus can achieve low-order global model identification for systems that can bifurcate to multiple equilibria after solely collecting measurements from a local stable operational regime. The developed framework is tested for several examples of increasing dimension and complexity, up to a test case of the viscous Burgers' equation with Robin boundary conditions. In the latter case, this study enforces new directions of employing data-driven reduced model inference that successfully can provide low-order accurate surrogate predictive models suitable for control. Future directions and open challenges conclude this work.</description>

      <title>Divisibility of Integer Laurent Polynomials, Homoclinic Points, and Lacunary Independence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$, $p$, and $q$ be Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients in one or several variables, and suppose that $f$ divides $p+q$. We establish sufficient conditions to guarantee that $f$ individually divides $p$ and $q$. These conditions involve a bound on coefficients, a separation between the supports of $p$ and $q$, and, surprisingly, a requirement on the complex variety of $f$ called atorality satisfied by many but not all polynomials.
  Our proof involves a related dynamical system and the fundamental dynamical notion of homoclinic point. Without the atorality assumption our methods fail, and it is unknown whether our results hold without this assumption.</description>

      <title>A logarithm law for nonautonomous systems fastly converging to equilibrium and mean field coupled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a nonautonomous system has in a certain sense a fast convergence to equilibrium (faster than any power law behavior) then the time $\tau _{r}(x,y)$ needed for a typical point $x$ to enter for the first time in a ball $B(y,r)$ centered in $y$, with small radius \ $r $ scales as the local dimension of the equilibrium measure \ $\mu $ at $y$, i.e. $$ \underset{r\rightarrow 0}{\lim }\frac{\log \tau _{r}(x,y)}{-\log r}% =d_{\mu }(y).$$
  We then apply the general result to concrete systems of different kind, showing such a logarithm law for asymptotically authonomous solenoidal maps and mean field coupled expanding maps.</description>

      <title>Strong ergodicity phenomena for Bernoulli shifts of bounded algebraic dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.04989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic dimension of a Polish permutation group $Q\leq \mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb{N})$ is the smallest $n\in\omega$, so that for all $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of size $n+1$, the orbit of every $a\in A$ under the pointwise stabilizer of $A\setminus\{a\}$ is finite. We study the Bernoulli shift $P\curvearrowright \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ for various Polish permutation groups $P$ and we provide criteria under which the $P$-shift is generically ergodic relative to the injective part of the $Q$-shift, when $Q$ has algebraic dimension $\leq n$. We use this to show that the sequence of pairwise $*$-reduction-incomparable equivalence relations defined in [KP21] is a strictly increasing sequence in the Borel reduction hierarchy. We also use our main theorem to exhibit an equivalence relation of pinned cardinal $\aleph_1^{+}$ which strongly resembles the equivalence relation of pinned cardinal $\aleph_1^{+}$ from [Zap11], but which does not Borel reduce to the latter. It remains open whether they are actually incomparable under Borel reductions.
  Our proofs rely on the study of symmetric models whose symmetries come from the group $Q$. We show that when $Q$ is "locally finite" -- e.g. when $Q=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{M})$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is a locally finite countable structure with no algebraicity -- the corresponding symmetric model admits a theory of supports which is analogous to that in the basic Cohen model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we defined an "elementary" alternative to the ECH capacities of symplectic four-manifolds, using max-min energy of holomorphic curves subject to point constraints, and avoiding the use of Seiberg-Witten theory. In the present paper we use a variant of this construction to define an alternative to the ECH spectrum of a contact three-manifold. The alternative spectrum has applications to Reeb dynamics in three dimensions. In particular, we adapt ideas from a previous joint paper with Edtmair to obtain quantitative closing lemmas for Reeb vector fields in three dimensions. For the example of an irrational ellipsoid, we obtain a sharp quantitative closing lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and exponential decay of mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems in $L^p$-phase spaces on the framework of real hyperbolic manifold $\mathbb{H}^d(\mathbb{R})$, where $d \geqslant 2$ and $1&lt;p\leq d$. We consider a couple of Ebin-Marsden's Laplace and Laplace-Beltrami operators associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. Primarily, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the bounded mild solution for the linear system by using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup. Next, using the fixed point arguments, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to establish the existence of the bounded mild solutions. Due to Gronwall's inequality, we will clarify the exponential stability of such solutions. Finally, we give an application of stability to the existence of periodic mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems.</description>

      <title>Mercury's chaotic secular evolution as a subdiffusive process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mercury's orbit can destabilize, generally resulting in a collision with either Venus or the Sun. Chaotic evolution can cause g1 to decrease to the approximately constant value of g5 and create a resonance. Previous work has approximated the variation in g1 as stochastic diffusion, which leads to a phenomological model that can reproduce the Mercury instability statistics of secular and N-body models on timescales longer than 10 Gyr. Here we show that the diffusive model underpredicts the Mercury instability probability by a factor of 3-10,000 on timescales less than 5 Gyr, the remaining lifespan of the Solar System. This is because g1 exhibits larger variations on short timescales than the diffusive model would suggest. To better model the variations on short timescales, we build a new subdiffusive phenomological model for g1. Subdiffusion is similar to diffusion but exhibits larger displacements on short timescales and smaller displacements on long timescales. We choose model parameters based on the behavior of the g1 trajectories in the N-body simulations, leading to a tuned model that can reproduce Mercury instability statistics from 1-40 Gyr. This work motivates fundamental questions in Solar System dynamics: Why does subdiffusion better approximate the variation in g1 than standard diffusion? Why is there an upper bound on g1, but not a lower bound that would prevent it from reaching g5?</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group and $(X, \Gamma)$ a compact topological dynamical system. We study the question of the existence of an intermediate $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathcal{A}$ $$C^{*}_{r}(\Gamma)&lt;\mathcal{A}&lt;C(X)\rtimes_r\Gamma,$$ which is not of the form $\mathcal{A} = C(Y) \rtimes_r \Gamma$, corresponding to a factor map $(X,\Gamma) \to (Y,\Gamma)$. Here $ C^{*}_{r} (\Gamma)$ and $C(X) \rtimes_r \Gamma$ are the reduced $C^*$-algebras of $\Gamma$ and $(X,\Gamma)$ respectively. Our main results are (1) For $\Gamma$, which is not $C^*$-simple, if $(X,\Gamma)$ admits a $\Gamma$-invariant probability measure, then such a sub-algebra always exists. (2) For $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}$ and $(X, \Gamma)$ an irrational rotation of the circle $X = S^1$, we give a full description of all these non-crossed-product subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Tracking the distance to criticality in systems with unknown noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems undergo abrupt changes in dynamics as they move across critical points, often with dramatic consequences. Much existing theory on identifying the time-series signatures of nearby critical points -- such as increased variance and slower timescales -- is derived for the case of fixed, low-amplitude noise. However, real-world systems are often corrupted by unknown levels of noise that can distort these temporal signatures. Here we aimed to develop noise-robust indicators of the distance to criticality (DTC) for systems affected by dynamical noise in two cases: when the noise amplitude is fixed, or is unknown and variable across recordings. To approach this problem, we compare the ability of over 7000 candidate time-series features to track the DTC in the vicinity of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We recover existing theory in the fixed-noise case, highlighting conventional time-series features that accurately track the DTC. But in the variable-noise setting, where these conventional indicators perform poorly, we highlight new types of high-performing time-series features and show that their success is accomplished by capturing the shape of the invariant density (which depends on both the DTC and the noise amplitude) relative to the spread of fast fluctuations (which depends on the noise amplitude). We introduce a new high-performing time-series statistic, the Rescaled Auto-Density (RAD), that combines these two algorithmic components. We then use RAD to provide new evidence that brain regions higher in the visual hierarchy are positioned closer to criticality, supporting existing hypotheses about patterns of brain organization that are not detected using conventional metrics of the DTC. Our results demonstrate how large-scale algorithmic comparison can yield theoretical insights that can motivate new theory and interpretable algorithms for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the analysis of optical quantum systems using the Koopman operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of photon echoes is a crucial technique for gaining an understanding of optical quantum systems. However, it requires a large number of simulations with varying parameters and/or input pulses, which renders numerical studies expensive. This article investigates how we can use data-driven surrogate models based on the Koopman operator to accelerate this process while maintaining accuracy over a large number of time steps. To this end, we employ a bilinear Koopman model using extended dynamic mode decomposition and simulate the optical Bloch equations for an ensemble of inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems. Such systems are well suited to describe the excitation of excitonic resonances in semiconductor nanostructures, for example, ensembles of semiconductor quantum dots. We perform a detailed study on the required number of system simulations such that the resulting data-driven Koopman model is sufficiently accurate for a wide range of parameter settings. We analyze the L2 error and the relative error of the photon echo peak and investigate how the control positions relate to the stabilization. After proper training, our methods can predict the quantum ensemble's dynamics accurately and numerically efficiently.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an autonomous system with closed-loop damping for first-order convex optimization. While, to this day, optimal rates of convergence are almost exclusively achieved by non-autonomous methods via open-loop damping (e.g., Nesterov's algorithm), we show that our system, featuring a closed-loop damping, exhibits a rate arbitrarily close to the optimal one. We do so by coupling the damping and the speed of convergence of the system via a well-chosen Lyapunov function. By discretizing our system we then derive an algorithm and present numerical experiments supporting our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations with uncertainty quantification. Our framework incorporates online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, facilitated by differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Subexponential lower bounds for $f$-ergodic Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for establishing lower bounds on the rate of convergence in $f$-variation of a continuous-time ergodic Markov process to its invariant measure. The criterion consists of novel super- and submartingale conditions for certain functionals of the Markov process. It provides a general approach for proving lower bounds on the tails of the invariant measure and the rate of convergence in $f$-variation of a Markov process, analogous to the widely used Lyapunov drift conditions for upper bounds. Our key technical innovation produces lower bounds on the tails of the heights and durations of the excursions from bounded sets of a continuous-time Markov process using path-wise arguments.
  We apply our theory to elliptic diffusions and L\'evy-driven stochastic differential equations with known polynomial/stretched exponential upper bounds on their rates of convergence. Our lower bounds match asymptotically the known upper bounds for these classes of models, thus establishing their rate of convergence to stationarity. The generality of the approach suggests that, analogous to the Lyapunov drift conditions for upper bounds, our methods can be expected to find applications in many other settings.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Bose-Hubbard model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we searh for monochromatic infinite additive structures involving polynomials on $\mathbb{N}$. Ultimately, we can prove that for any $r\in \mathbb{N}$, any distinct natural numbers $a,b$ and any $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exist subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $|B|=r$ and $|C|=\infty$ such that there exists a color containing $B+aC$ and $B+bC$. In fact, for the specific question considered by us, we give a complete answer.</description>
