      <title>Beyond Resolution: Multi - Scale Weather and Climate Data for Alpine Renewable Energy in the Digital Twin Era - First Evaluations and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Austrian hydropower production plummeted by 44% in early 2025 due to reduced snowpack, it exposed a critical vulnerability: standard meteorological and climatological datasets systematically fail in mountain regions that hold untapped renewable potential. This perspectives paper evaluates emerging solutions to the Alpine energy-climate data gap, analyzing datasets from global reanalyses (ERA5, 31 km) to kilometre-scale Digital Twins (Climate DT, Extremes DT, 4.4 km), regional reanalyses (ARA, 2.5 km), and next-generation AI weather prediction models (AIFS, 31 km). The multi-resolution assessment reveals that no single dataset excels universally: coarse reanalyses provide essential climatologies but miss valley-scale processes, while Digital Twins resolve Alpine dynamics yet remain computationally demanding. Effective energy planning therefore requires strategic dataset combinations validated against energy-relevant indices such as population-weighted extremes, wind-gust return periods, and Alpine-adjusted storm thresholds. A key frontier is sub-hourly (10-15 min) temporal resolution to match grid-operation needs. Six evidence-based recommendations outline pathways for bridging spatial and temporal scales. As renewable deployment expands globally into complex terrain, the Alpine region offers transferable perspectives for tackling identical forecasting and climate analysis challenges in mountainous regions worldwide.</description>

      <title>Efficient Regional Storm Surge Surrogate Model Training Strategy Under Evolving Landscape and Climate Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coastal communities can be exposed to risk from catastrophic storm-induced coastal hazards, causing major global losses each year. Recent advances in computational power have enabled the integration of machine learning (ML) into coastal hazard modeling, particularly for storm surge prediction. Given the potential variation in future climate and landscape conditions, efficient predictive models that can incorporate multiple future scenarios are needed. Existing studies built a framework for training ML models using storm surge simulation data under different potential future climate and landscape scenarios. However, storm surge simulation data under designed future scenarios require computationally expensive numerical simulations of synthetic storm suites over extensive geospatial grids. As the number of designed scenarios increases, the computational cost associated with both numerical simulation and ML training increases rapidly. This study introduces a cost-effective reduction strategy that incorporates new scenario data while minimizing computational burden. The approach reduces training data across three dimensions: (1) grid points, (2) input features, and (3) storm suite size. Reducing the storm suite size is especially effective in cutting simulation costs. Model performance was evaluated using different ML algorithms, showing consistent effectiveness. When trained on 5,000 of 80,000 grid points, 10 of 12 features, and 40 of 90 storms, the model achieved an R=0.93, comparable to that of models trained on the full dataset, with substantially lower computational expense.</description>

      <title>SSTODE: Ocean-Atmosphere Physics-Informed Neural ODEs for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Turbulence Models to Represent Cloud-Edge Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering turbulence is crucial to understanding clouds. However, covering all scales involved in the turbulent mixing of clouds with their environment is computationally challenging, urging the development of simpler models to represent some of the processes involved. By using full direct numerical simulations as a reference, this study compares several statistical approaches for representing small-scale turbulent mixing. All models use a comparable Lagrangian representation of cloud microphysics, and simulate the same cases of cloud-edge mixing, covering different ambient humidities and turbulence intensities. It is demonstrated that all statistical models represent the evolution of thermodynamics successfully, but not all models capture the changes in cloud microphysics (cloud droplet number concentration, droplet mean radius, and spectral width). Implications of these results for using the presented models as subgrid-scale schemes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first focus on a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose fundamental challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</description>

      <title>Nowcast3D: Reliable precipitation nowcasting via gray-box learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\% of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.</description>
