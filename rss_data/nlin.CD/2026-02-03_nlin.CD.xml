      <title>Controlling extreme events in neuronal networks: A single driving signal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in a drive-response coupling framework extreme events are suppressed in the response system by the dominance of a single driving signal. We validate this approach across three distinct response network topologies, namely (i) a pair of coupled neurons, (ii) a monolayer network of N coupled neurons and (iii) a two-layer multiplex network each composed of FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal units. The response networks inherently exhibit extreme events. Our results demonstrate that influencing just one neuron in the response network with an appropriately tuned driving signal is sufficient to control extreme events across all three configurations. In the two-neuron case, suppression of extreme events occurs due to the breaking of phase-locking between the driving neuron and the targeted response neuron. In the case of monolayer and multiplex networks, suppression of extreme events results from the disruption of protoevent frequency dynamics and a subsequent frequency decoupling of the driven neuron from the rest of the network. We also observe that when the size of the neurons in response network connected to the drive increases, the onset of control occurs earlier indicating a scaling advantage of the method.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical study of a parametrically excited 2DOF oscillator with nonlinear restoring magnetic force and rotating rectangular rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a detailed analytical and numerical investigation of a nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) mechanical oscillator subjected to parametric excitation, magnetic stiffness nonlinearities, and dry friction. The considered system consists of two coupled oscillators, both of which are connected to a rotating rectangular beam that induces a time-periodic stiffness variation. The Complex Averaging (CxA) method is employed to derive approximate analytical solutions, which are thoroughly validated through time-domain simulations and bifurcation analyses. The dynamic analysis reveals a rich spectrum of nonlinear behaviors, including periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic responses. Detailed bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent analysis, and Poincar\'e maps demonstrate the influence of nonlinear stiffness degree, mass symmetry, and frictional effects on system stability and response amplitude. The obtained results give a significant understanding of the dynamic behavior of coupled nonlinear systems and establish a conceptual framework for the development of complex vibration abatement strategies, energy harvesting devices, and advanced mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Templex-based dynamical units for a taxonomy of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discriminating different types of chaos is still a very challenging topic, even for dissipative three-dimensional systems for which the most advanced tool is the template. Nevertheless, getting a template is, by definition, limited to three-dimensional objects, since based on knot theory. To deal with higher-dimensional chaos, we recently introduced the templex combining a flow-oriented {\sc BraMAH} cell complex and a directed graph (a digraph). There is no dimensional limitation in the concept of templex. Here, we show that a templex can be automatically reduced into a ``minimal'' form to provide a comprehensive and synthetic view of the main properties of chaotic attractors. This reduction allows for the development of a taxonomy of chaos in terms of two elementary units: the oscillating unit (O-unit) and the switching unit (S-unit). We apply this approach to various well-known attractors (R\"ossler, Lorenz, and Burke-Shaw) as well as a non-trivial four-dimensional attractor. A case of toroidal chaos (Deng) is also treated. This work is dedicated to Otto E. R\"ossler.</description>

      <title>Templex: a bridge between homologies and templates for chaotic attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of homologies introduces cell complexes to provide an algebraic description of spaces up to topological equivalence. Attractors in state space can be studied using Branched Manifold Analysis through Homologies: this strategy constructs a cell complex from a cloud of points in state space and uses homology groups to characterize its topology. The approach, however, does not consider the action of the flow on the cell complex. The procedure is here extended to take this fundamental property into account, as done with templates. The goal is achieved endowing the cell complex with a directed graph that prescribes the flow direction between its highest dimensional cells. The tandem of cell complex and directed graph, baptized templex, is shown to allow for a sophisticated characterization of chaotic attractors and for an accurate classification of them. The cases of a few well-known chaotic attractors are investigated -- namely the spiral and funnel R\"ossler attractors, the Lorenz attractor and the Burke and Shaw attractor. A link is established with their description in terms of templates.</description>

      <title>Neural Ising Machines via Unrolling and Zeroth-Order Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven heuristic for NP-hard Ising and Max-Cut optimization that learns the update rule of an iterative dynamical system. The method learns a shared, node-wise update rule that maps local interaction fields to spin updates, parameterized by a compact multilayer perceptron with a small number of parameters. Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes. Across standard Ising and neural combinatorial optimization benchmarks, NPIM achieves competitive solution quality and time-to-solution relative to recent learning-based methods and strong classical Ising-machine heuristics.</description>

      <title>Wave kinetics in an integrable model -- the Kaup-Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study wave turbulence in one-dimensional (1-D) bidirectional shallow water waves described by the Kaup-Boussinesq (KB) equation, which is known to be an integrable system. In contrast to the generally accepted empirical belief that an integrable system yields no kinetic theory, we derive and validate a non-trivial wave kinetic equation (WKE) for the KB system with a non-zero interaction coefficient on the four-wave resonant manifold. This WKE is non-homogeneous in nature due to the non-homogeneity in the dispersion relation of the KB system; however, approximate Kolomogrov-Zakharov (KZ) solutions can be derived in a novel way under certain approximations. We numerically verify the theoretical findings in two cases: (i) In free-evolution cases, although the discrete (nonlinear) spectrum remains unchanged as guaranteed by an integrable system's isospectrality, an initial arbitrary wavenumber spectrum quickly evolves into a thermo-equilibrium state, demonstrating the kinetic aspect of the system; (ii) in forced-dissipated cases, we find stationary power-law spectra that agree with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</description>

      <title>Blowup driven by critical balance in a differential kinetic model of gravity wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the blowup scenarios in a phase-parametrized differential approximation kinetic model (N-DAM), inspired by the physics of deep water surface gravity waves and recently obtained using large-$N$ summation techniques under a local approximation in wavenumber space. Previous work showed that the model admits steady-state solutions interpolating between the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum $E(\omega)\propto \omega^{-4}$ and either a strong-turbulence regime $E(\omega)\propto \omega^{-2}$ or the Phillips critical-balance spectrum $E(\omega) \propto \omega^{-5}$ at small scales. These solutions reproduce scaling regimes expected in gravity-wave kinetics, suggesting that the N-DAM may serve as an effective augmented version of an earlier differential approximation model introduced by Hasselmann. Here we investigate finite-time blowup in the N-DAM and show that it is generically governed by the critical-balance regime. This leads to a non-Kolmogorov finite-time transfer of the energy from the IR towards the UV for any value of the parameter $\phi \in [0,\pi)$. We observe a bifurcation in the blowup dynamics from continuous to discrete self-similarity as $\phi$ is increased above a critical value $\phi_*\simeq 2.7$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a discretely self-similar blowup in the kinetic theory of waves.</description>

      <title>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</description>
