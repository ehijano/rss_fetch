      <title>Dual-frequency optical-microwave atomic clocks based on cesium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^{133}$Cs, which is the only stable cesium (Cs) isotope, is one of the most investigated elements in atomic spectroscopy and was used to realize the atomic clock in 1955. Among all atomic clocks, the cesium atomic clock has a special place, since the current unit of time is based on a microwave transition in the Cs atom. In addition, the long lifetime of the $6{\text{P}}_{3/2}$ state and simple preparation technique of Cs vapor cells have great relevance to quantum and atom optics experiments, which suggests the use of the $6{\text{S}} - 6{\text{P}}$ D2 transition as an optical frequency standard. In this work, using one laser as the local oscillator and Cs atoms as the quantum reference, we realized two atomic clocks in the optical and microwave frequencies, respectively. Both clocks could be freely switched or simultaneously output. The optical clock based on the vapor cell continuously operated with a frequency stability of $3.89 \times {10^{ - 13}}$ at 1 s, decreasing to $2.17 \times {10^{ - 13}}$ at 32 s, which was frequency stabilized by modulation transfer spectroscopy and estimated by an optical comb. Then, applying this stabilized laser for an optically pumped Cs beam atomic clock to reduce the laser frequency noise, we obtained a microwave clock with a frequency stability of $1.84 \times {10^{ - 12}}/\sqrt \tau $, reaching $5.99 \times {10^{ - 15}}$ at $10^5$ s. This study demonstrates an attractive feature for the commercialization and deployment of optical and microwave clocks and will guide further development of integrated atomic clocks with better stability. Thus, this study lays the groundwork for future quantum metrology and laser physics.</description>

      <title>A Dual Open Atom Interferometer for Compact, Mobile Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an atom interferometer measurement protocol compatible with operation on a dynamic platform. Our method employs two open interferometers, derived from the same atomic source, with different interrogation times to eliminate initial velocity dependence while retaining precision, accuracy, and long term stability. We validate the protocol by measuring gravitational tides, achieving a precision of 4.5 {\mu}Gal in 2000 runs, marking the first demonstration of inertial quantity measurement with open atom interferometry that achieves long-term phase stability.</description>

      <title>3D surface profilometry using neutral helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transition in a large interacting driven atomic ensemble in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>

      <title>Observation of Generalized t-J Spin Dynamics with Tunable Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. Here, we report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We systematically explore the role of dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the effect of motion on spin dynamics. The model parameters can be controlled independently, with dipolar couplings tuned by electric fields and motion regulated by optical lattices. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. These observations are supported by theory models established in different motional regimes that provide intuitive pictures of the underlying physics. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods, and it could shed light on the complex behaviors observed in real materials.</description>
