      <title>BiTSA: Leveraging Time Series Foundation Model for Building Energy Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating AI technologies into digital infrastructure offers transformative potential for energy management, particularly in enhancing energy efficiency and supporting net-zero objectives. However, the complexity of IoT-generated datasets often poses a significant challenge, hindering the translation of research insights into practical, real-world applications. This paper presents the design of an interactive visualization tool, BiTSA. The tool enables building managers to interpret complex energy data quickly and take immediate, data-driven actions based on real-time insights. By integrating advanced forecasting models with an intuitive visual interface, our solution facilitates proactive decision-making, optimizes energy consumption, and promotes sustainable building management practices. BiTSA will empower building managers to optimize energy consumption, control demand-side energy usage, and achieve sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>Transversal PACS Browser API: Addressing Interoperability Challenges in Medical Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in imaging technologies have revolutionised the medical imaging and healthcare sectors, leading to the widespread adoption of PACS for the storage, retrieval, and communication of medical images. Although these systems have improved operational efficiency, significant challenges remain in effectively retrieving DICOM images, which are essential for diagnosis and overall patient care. Moreover, issues such as fragmented systems, interoperability barriers, and complex user interfaces can often prevent healthcare professionals from efficiently accessing medical images. Addressing these challenges, the Transversal PACS Browser API is a robust and user-friendly solution designed to enhance the process of querying and retrieving DICOM images. It offers advanced filtering capabilities through a variety of filter options as well as a custom field search, that allows users to easily navigate through large medical image collections with ease. Additionally, the application provides a unified interface for querying and retrieving from multiple PACS stations, addressing the challenges of fragmentation and complexity associated with accessing medical images. Other key features include the ability to pre-view images directly within the application. All of this contributes to the transversal nature of the API, serving not only healthcare providers, but anyone who relies on efficient access to these resources. To validate the performance and usability of the application, comprehensive testing was carried out with stakeholders of the field, the results of which showed general satisfaction, highlighting the API's clean design, ease of use, and effective search capabilities of the API, as well as the usefulness of previewing images within the application.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-convolution-invariant shell approximation to spherically-symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a class of functions Omega_N(x; mu, nu) in N-dimensional space concentrated around a spherical shell of the radius mu and such that, being convoluted with an isotropic Gaussian function, these functions do not change their expression but only a value of its 'width' parameter, nu. Isotropic Gaussian functions are a particular case of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) corresponding to mu = 0. Due to their features, these functions are an efficient tool to build approximations to smooth and continuous spherically-symmetric functions including oscillating ones. Atomic images in limited-resolution maps of the electron density, electrostatic scattering potential and other scalar fields studied in physics, chemistry, biology, and other natural sciences are examples of such functions. We give simple analytic expressions of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) for N = 1, 2, 3 and analyze properties of these functions. Representation of oscillating functions by a sum of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) allows calculating distorted maps for the same cost as the respective theoretical fields. We give practical examples of such representation for the interference functions of the uniform unit spheres for N = 1, 2, 3 that define the resolution of the respective images. Using the chain rule and analytic expressions of the Omega_N(x; mu, nu) derivatives makes simple refinement of parameters of the models which describe these fields.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time Series Categorization and Temporal Fusion Transformers to Improve Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizing and managing cryptocurrency portfolios and decision-making on transactions is crucial in this market. Optimal selection of assets is one of the main challenges that requires accurate prediction of the price of cryptocurrencies. In this work, we categorize the financial time series into several similar subseries to increase prediction accuracy by learning each subseries category with similar behavior. For each category of the subseries, we create a deep learning model based on the attention mechanism to predict the next step of each subseries. Due to the limited amount of cryptocurrency data for training models, if the number of categories increases, the amount of training data for each model will decrease, and some complex models will not be trained well due to the large number of parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose to combine the time series data of other cryptocurrencies to increase the amount of data for each category, hence increasing the accuracy of the models corresponding to each category.</description>

      <title>Physics-augmented neural networks for constitutive modeling of hyperelastic geometrically exact beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present neural network-based constitutive models for hyperelastic geometrically exact beams. The proposed models are physics-augmented, i.e., formulated to fulfill important mechanical conditions by construction, which improves accuracy and generalization. Strains and curvatures of the beam are used as input for feed-forward neural networks that represent the effective hyperelastic beam potential. Forces and moments are received as the gradients of the beam potential, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Normalization conditions are considered via additional projection terms. Symmetry conditions are implemented by an invariant-based approach for transverse isotropy and a more flexible point symmetry constraint, which is included in transverse isotropy but poses fewer restrictions on the constitutive response. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to improve the scaling behavior of the models for varying cross-section radii. Additionally, we introduce a parameterization with a scalar parameter to represent ring-shaped cross-sections with different ratios between the inner and outer radii. Formulating the beam potential as a neural network provides a highly flexible model. This enables efficient constitutive surrogate modeling for geometrically exact beams with nonlinear material behavior and cross-sectional deformation, which otherwise would require computationally much more expensive methods. The models are calibrated and tested with data generated for beams with circular and ring-shaped hyperelastic deformable cross-sections at varying inner and outer radii, showing excellent accuracy and generalization. The applicability of the proposed point symmetric model is further demonstrated by applying it in beam simulations. In all studied cases, the proposed model shows excellent performance.</description>
