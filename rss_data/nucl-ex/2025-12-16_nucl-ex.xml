      <title>Charged energy correlators in small systems with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlators (EECs), which are energy-weighted cross-sections of particle pairs, offer incisive probes into QCD dynamics, across the full scale of jet evolution, by separating energy scales in the jet fragmentation through the angular distance of the resulting particle pairs. Charged EECs probe the energy flux carried by pairs of the same or opposite electric charges. The interplay between energy distribution and charge conservation enables charged EECs to provide novel constraints on hadronization mechanisms. We present the first measurements of two-point charged energy correlators of inclusive jets in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV using the ALICE detector, and compare them with hadronization models to investigate different confinement mechanisms. We also present measurements in p-Pb collisions, examining cold nuclear matter effects on jet evolution.</description>

      <title>Formation and lifetime measurements of light hypernuclei in Ag+Ag collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 2.55 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first observation of $\mathrm{^{3}_\Lambda H}$ and $\mathrm{^{4}_\Lambda H}$ in Ag+Ag collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 2.55 GeV, emitted around mid-rapidity. The hypernuclei are reconstructed via their two-body decay channels and identified through their weak-decay topology, employing an artificial neural network for enhanced discrimination. The analysis methodology is validated using $\Lambda$ hyperons. The resulting rapidity distributions, dN/dy, exhibit a bell shape centered at mid-rapidity. The yield of $\mathrm{^{4}_\Lambda H}$ is equal to or exceeds that of $\mathrm{^{3}_\Lambda H}$, which contrasts the measurement from the STAR collaboration at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 3 GeV and is consistent with a scenario in which hypernuclei receive feed-down from excited states. The data enable a high-precision measurement of the hypernuclei lifetimes. For the $\mathrm{^{3}_\Lambda H}$, a lifetime of $\mathrm{\tau_{^{3}_\Lambda H}}$ = $(239 \pm 23{\mathrm{(stat)}} \pm 18{\mathrm{(sys)}})\,\mathrm{ps}$, is extracted, consistent on the 1$\sigma$ level with that of the free $\Lambda$. In contrast, the $\mathrm{^{4}_\Lambda H}$ lifetime of $\mathrm{\tau_{^{4}_\Lambda H}}$ = $(209 \pm 7{\mathrm{(stat)}} \pm 10{\mathrm{(sys)}})\,\mathrm{ps}$, shows a 4.5 $\sigma$ deviation from the free $\Lambda$ lifetime. The results consolidate the available world data.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum reconstruction in the QGP background with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06466v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a Dense Neural Network (DNN) approach to reconstruct jet momentum within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background, using simulated data from PYTHIA and Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Models for comparative analysis. We find that medium response particles from the LBT simulation, scattered out of the QGP background but belonging to medium-modified jets, lead to oversubtraction of the background if the DNN model is trained on vacuum jets from PYTHIA simulation. By training the DNN model on quenched jets generated using LBT or the combination of jet samples from PYTHIA and LBT, we significantly reduce this prediction bias and achieve more accurate background subtraction compared to conventional Area-based and Constituent Subtraction methods widely adopted in experimental measurements. We further study the performance of these machine learning models on evaluating the nuclear modification factor of jets, and find that while the unfolding procedure is necessary for correcting residuals in reconstructed jet momenta, models trained on samples incorporating quenched jets still achieve superior accuracy than those trained on vacuum jets even after unfolding.</description>

      <title>From DGLAP to Sudakov: Precision Predictions for Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations in the distribution of energy produced in collider experiments provide a snapshot of the microscopic dynamics of QCD, and its evolution from asymptotically free quarks and gluons, to confined hadrons. There has recently been considerable progress in the interpretation and precision calculation of these correlations, using a specific class of observables called energy correlators (EECs). These observables are most cleanly studied in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where they can be measured over their full angular range. Of particular interest are kinematic limits of the correlator, both collinear, and back-to-back, where the correlator exhibits scaling behaviors governed by specific operators in QCD. Resolving these scalings requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, which can be achieved by performing measurements on tracks (charged particles). In this paper we perform the first calculation of the track-based EEC over its entire kinematic range, achieving a record precision of of NNLL (collinear) + NNLO (fixed order) + NNNNLL (back-to-back) for the track-based EEC, and additionally incorporate the leading non-perturbative corrections and their resummation, including the Collins-Soper kernel computed using lattice QCD. We describe the breadth of physics probed by this observable, and highlight the impact of different components of our factorization theorem on the final distribution. Combined with recent measurements of the track-based EEC with archival LEP data, our calculation initiates the precision study of track-based observables at LEP, which will lead to new insights into the dynamics of QCD, and the precision extraction of its underlying parameters.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni precludes a strong NiCu cycle in Type-I X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-observation comparisons of type-I X-ray bursts (XRBs) can reveal the properties of accreting neutron star systems, including the neutron star compactness. XRBs are powered by nuclear burning and a handful of reactions have been shown to impact the model results. Reactions in the NiCu cycles, featuring a competition between $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\gamma$)$^{60}$Zn and $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni, have been shown to be among the most important reactions as they are a critical checkpoint in $rp$-process flow and significantly impact the light curves and burst ashes. We report a direct measurement of $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni bringing stringent constraints on this reaction rate. New results rule out a strong NiCu cycle in XRBs, with a negligible degree of recycling, $\leq$5\% up to 1.5 GK. The new reaction rate, when varied within new uncertainty limits, shows no impact on one-zone XRB model light-curves tailored for clocked-burster $\tt{GS 1826-24}$, hence removing an important nuclear physics uncertainty in the model-observation comparison.</description>

      <title>Updated Simulation of GRETA Detector Response and Exploration of Temperature Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking Array (GRETA) is a next-generation gamma-ray spectrometer designed to push the frontiers of nuclear structure and astrophysics experiment. Its high sensitivity is enabled by high-precision localization of gamma-ray interactions within its active detector volume, and the subsequent tracking of gamma-ray scattering sequences. In order to perform gamma-ray tracking, we need to simulate signal generation in the detectors accurately. This requires both accurate calculations of charge movement in the semiconductor volume, as well as a faithful reproduction of real-world experimental effects such as the electronics response. This work addresses the fidelity of the calculated signals for GRETA in two ways. An updated approach has been applied to find an optimized parameterization of the electronics response, while the impact of the detector temperature was also explored to best reproduce experimental signals and improve the position localization performance for GRETA. The results suggest that the electronics response can be simplified without impacting performance, and that the response correction parameters can effectively compensate for the changes in signal which arise due to the crystal temperature, resulting in minimal sensitivity of the position resolution to the assumed temperature.</description>

      <title>Emergence of thermal recoil jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the established paradigm of jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jets from initial hard parton scatterings are suppressed due to their interaction with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) as they traverse the hot medium, serving as crucial tomographic probes of QGP properties. The QGP is also capable of absorbing and reprocessing energy deposited by the hard jets into emergent jet-like objects, providing a novel production mechanism of thermal recoil jets. These emergent thermal recoil jets exhibit distinct transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) and jet-size ($R$) dependencies different from the hard jets, and naturally explain the puzzling observation of the enhanced yields of hadron or photon triggered jets at large azimuthal angle and solely at small $p_\mathrm{T}$ and large $R$. These thermal recoil jets are predicted to have unique substructures, such as their jet shape that increases with the radius and the thermal-like distribution of their constituents, which can be verified in future experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Single-step Quantum Simulation of Two Nucleons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a scalable approach to solving the nuclear shell model, a highly complex and exponentially scaled many-body problem. This work presents a numerical simulation of the subspace search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) combined with an adaptive derivative-assembles pseudo-trotter (ADAPT) ansatz to obtain the low-lying states of any nuclear system in a single optimization run. As an example, we apply this method in this work to a trivial identical nucleon system, two nucleons in the $0p_{3/2}$ orbital, mapped to 4 qubits depicting m-scheme single-particle states including a surface delta effective interaction using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The ADAPT-SSVQE algorithm, by utilizing a symmetry-preserving double-excitation ADAPT operator pool, uniquely optimizes a weighted energy sum, forcing the simultaneous convergence of two lowest states within the total angular momentum $M_J=0$ subspace. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by benchmarking against the exact diagonalization, confirming its potential for probing nuclear structure and pairing phenomena on current and near-future quantum devices without requiring multi-step procedure for excited states.</description>

      <title>Sign Reversal of Boer-Mulders Functions from Semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering to the Drell-Yan Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A striking prediction of QCD on the properties of the novel Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) distribution functions is that the time-reversal odd Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions extracted from semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) will undergo a sign reversal in the Drell-Yan (DY) process. This prediction has been tested by experiments that have focused on the Sivers functions so far. We examine the current status on the theoretical prediction and experimental extraction of the signs of the Boer-Mulders functions from SIDIS and DY. We show that the existing SIDIS and DY data are consistent with the predicted sign reversal of the Boer-Mulders functions for proton's valence quark distribution. Prospects for future experiments at EIC capable of testing the sign reversal of the pion Boer-Mulders functions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the pion gluon distribution at small-$x$ in photon-induced interactions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose the analysis of the heavy quark photoproduction associated with a leading neutron in hadronic collisions at the LHC as an alternative to probe the pion gluon distribution in a kinematical range not covered by previous experiments. We perform an exploratory study of the charm and bottom photoproduction associated with a leading neutron in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-lead ($pPb$) collisions, and present calculations for the rapidity distributions and cross-sections. Our predictions indicate that experimental studies of these processes are feasible, and that a future measurement of this final state will be useful to constrain the pion gluon distribution at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable and to improve our understanding of the pion structure.</description>

      <title>Shell model study of isobaric analog states for $T_z= \pm 2$ nuclei using isospin non-conserving interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to comprehend the process underlying mirror energy differences in mirror pairs, we have performed shell-model calculations for $T_z= \pm 2$ $sd$-shell nuclei in the mass range $A$= 20 to 36 and neutron number varying from $N$= 8 to 20. Isospin-symmetry breaking (ISB) is responsible for the mirror energy difference of excited states. We have investigated the {\color{black}isospin non-conserving} interactions: USDC and USDCm to explore the low-lying energy spectra, mirror energy differences, isoscalar ($M_0$), isovector ($M_1$) matrix elements, \textit{E2} transition probability, magnetic ($\mu$), and quadrupole moments ($Q$) of mirror-pair and compared them with their available experimental data. The impact of single-particle states on weakly bound and unbound nuclear states are investigated, especially those of the $s$-wave. We have also analyzed single proton/neutron separation energies and proton/neutron occupancy for ($T_z$=-2)/($T_z$=+2) $sd$-shell nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We present results from the Jefferson Lab E08-014 experiment, investigating short-range correlations (SRC) through measurements of inclusive quasi-elastic scattering from $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ca. The kinematics were selected to isolate scattering from SRCs, yielding a plateau in the A/$^2$H cross-section ratios due to the universal two-body structure of the 2N-SRCs in light and heavy nuclei. We observe approximate plateaus in the A/$^2$H ratios and provide the first extractions of the A/$^2$H ratio for $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. We also examine the A/$^3$He ratio, aiming to identify three-nucleon SRCs (3N-SRCs). Following the approach for isolating 2N-SRCs, searching for 3N-SRC dominance involved measuring the A/$^3$He cross section ratio at modest-to-large $Q^2$ values and looking for a plateau ratios for $x \gtorder 2.5$. This was not observed in the data, and in fact increasing $Q^2$ values moved the data \textit{further away} from the predicted plateau. We show here that, when analyzed in terms of the struck nucleon's light-cone momentum, the data exhibited the expected trend, progressively approaching the predicted 3N-SRC plateau. These observations suggest that future measurements at higher energies may facilitate a definitive isolation and identification of 3N-SRCs.</description>

      <title>Detection of molecular hydrogen in a neutron beam lifetime experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One method of determining the free neutron lifetime involves the absolute counting of neutrons and trapped decay protons. In such experiments, a cold neutron beam traverses a segmented proton trap inside a superconducting solenoid while the neutron flux is continuously monitored. Protons that are born within the fiducial volume of the trap are confined radially by the magnetic field and axially by the electrostatic potential supplied by trap electrodes. They are periodically released and counted, and the ratio of the absolute number of neutrons to protons is proportional to the neutron lifetime. Systematic error can be introduced if protons in the trap are lost, gained, or misidentified. The influence of molecular hydrogen interactions is of particular interest because of its ubiquitous presence in ultrahigh vacuum systems. To understand how it could affect the neutron lifetime, measurements were performed on the production and detection of molecular hydrogen in an apparatus used to measure the neutron lifetime. We demonstrate that charge exchange with molecular hydrogen can occur with trapped protons, and we determine the efficiency with which the molecular hydrogen ions in the trap are detected. Finally, we comment on the potential impact on a neutron lifetime experiment using this beam technique. We find that the result of the beam neutron lifetime performed at NIST is unlikely to have been significantly affected by charge exchange with molecular hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Electron-antineutrino spectrum from precision measurements of $^{144}$Pr-decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $^{144}$Ce -- $^{144}$Pr electron antineutrino source is one of the most suitable radiochemical sources for experiments searching for the oscillations of active neutrinos to the light sterile state. In the current work the $\beta$-spectra of $^{144}\rm{Ce}$ -- ${^{144}\rm{Pr}}$ source have been measured by two types of $\beta$-spectrometers based on silicon Si(Li) detectors in order to determine the energy spectrum of electron anti-neutrino emitted in the $\beta$-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei. The nuclear shape factor of the ground state beta transition in ${^{144}\rm{Pr}}-{^{144}\rm{Nd}}$ has been obtained with high precision: $C(W) = 1 + (-0.0301 \pm 0.0007)W + (-0.101 \pm 0.006)W^{-1}$. The reduced cross section for the inverse beta decay reaction on hydrogen for the $\rm{{^{144}Pr}}$ electron anti-neutrino source has been defined as $\rm{(4.7344 \pm 0.0006_{stat} \pm 0.013_{syst}) \times 10^{-44}~cm^2 {decay}^{-1}}$ that provides sufficient sensitivity to search for a sterile neutrino with a mass of $m_4 \sim 1$~eV and a mixing angle $Sin^2(2\theta_{14}) \sim 0.005$ using standard disappearance method.</description>

      <title>Exclusive vector-toponium photoproduction in hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exploratory study of the exclusive production of a vector - toponium $\psi_t$ state by photon - hadron interactions is performed considering proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) energies. The scattering amplitude is calculated using the $k_T$ - factorization formalism assuming that the vector - toponium state can be described by a Gaussian light-cone wave function and considering different models for the unintegrated gluon distribution. Predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross - sections are presented. Our results indicate that the experimental measurement of this final state will be very difficult for the expected integrated luminosities at the LHC and FCC.</description>

      <title>Effects of mean-field momentum dependence on pion production in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pion production in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies provides an important probe of the collision dynamics and nuclear matter equation of state, especially the high-density behavior of the symmetry energy. Using the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model with a recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential, we investigate the effects of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials on the pion production in Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$~GeV/nucleon. We find that a stronger momentum dependence, for which the nucleon mean-field potentials increase faster with momentum, generally suppresses pion production. This feature can be understood in terms of the mean-field-induced modification of nucleon high-momentum phase space during the compression stage: a stronger momentum dependence can reduce the relative fraction of high-momentum nucleons in heavy-ion collisions, thereby suppressing the production of $\Delta$ resonances and pions.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin polarization from $\rho$ meson condensation in rotating hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of vector mesons in extreme environments provides a unique probe of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We investigate the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of spin-1 $\rho$ mesons in dense rotating hadronic matter, a regime relevant to the peripheral heavy-ion collisions and the interiors of rapidly rotating neutron stars. When the $\rho$ meson chemical potential ($\mu_\rho$) approaches its effective mass ($m_\rho^*$), a phase transition to BEC occurs. We demonstrate that this transition is non-trivially influenced by global rotation, which couples to the spin of the $\rho$ mesons, leading to a macroscopic spin alignment of the condensate along the axis of rotation. This interplay between condensation and rotation results in distinct polarization patterns, which can serve as a possible signature of a BEC in experiments. The results suggest that rapidly rotating neutron stars may harbor an anisotropic, spin-polarized $\rho$-condensed phase, which could impact their equation of state.</description>
