      <title>Totally real algebraic numbers in generalized Mandelbrot set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study some potential theoretical and topological aspects of the generalized Mandelbrot set introduced by Baker and DeMarco. For $\alpha$ real, we study the set of all totally real algebraic parameters $c$ such that $\alpha$ is preperiodic under the iteration of the one-parameter family $f_c(x) = x^2 + c$. We show that when $|\alpha| &lt; 2$ and rational then the set of totally real algebraic parameters $c$ with this property is finite, whereas if $|\alpha| \geq 2$ and rational then this set is countably infinite. As an unexpected consequence of this study, we also show that when $|\alpha| \geq 2$ then parameters $c$ such that $\alpha$ is $f_c$-periodic are necessarily real. As a special case, we classify all totally real algebraic integers $c$ such that $\alpha = \pm1$ is preperiodic.</description>

      <title>The Artin-Maur zeta function for interval maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the Artin-Mazur zeta function for piecewise monotone functions acting on a compact interval of real numbers. In the case of unimodal maps, Milnor and Thurston gave a characterization for the rationality of the Artin-Mazur zeta function in terms of the orbit of the unique turning point. We show that for multimodal maps, the previous characterization does not hold.</description>

      <title>Strategic control for a Boltzmann like decision-making model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a prototypical non-polynomial decision-making model for which agents in a population potentially alternate between two consumption strategies, one related to the exploitation of an unlimited but considerably expensive resource and the other a comparably cheaper but restricted and slowly renewable source. In particular, we study a model following a Boltzmann-like exploration policy, enhancing the accuracy at which the exchange rates are captured with respect to classical polynomial approaches by considering sigmoidal functions to represent the cost-profit relation in both exploit strategies. Additionally, given the intrinsic timescale separation between the decision-making process and recovery rates of the renewable resource, we use geometric singular perturbation theory to analyze the model. We further use numerical analysis to determine parameter ranges for which the model undergoes bifurcations. These bifurcations, being related to critical states of the system, are relevant to the fast transitions between strategies. Hence, we design controllers to regulate such rapid transitions by taking advantage of the system's criticality.</description>

      <title>A new class of $\alpha$-Farey maps and an application to normal numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two types of the $\alpha$-Farey maps $F_{\alpha}$ and $F_{\alpha, \flat}$ for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \tfrac{1}{2}$, which were previously defined only for $\tfrac{1}{2} \le \alpha \le 1$ by R.~Natsui (2004). Then, for each $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \tfrac{1}{2}$, we construct the natural extension maps on the plane and show that the natural extension of $F_{\alpha, \flat}$ is metrically isomorphic to the natural extension of the original Farey map. As an application, we show that the set of normal numbers associted with $\alpha$-continued fractions does not vary by the choice of $\alpha$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$. This extends the result by C.~Kraaikamp and H.~Nakada (2000).</description>

      <title>A flat perspective on moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic cone surfaces were previously defined and computed when the angles of the cone singularities are at most 2pi. We propose a general definition of these volumes without restriction on the angles. This construction is based on flat geometry as our proposed volume is a limit of Masur-Veech volumes of moduli spaces of multi-differentials. This idea generalizes the observation in quantum gravity that the Jackiw-Teitelboim partition function is a limit of minimal string partition functions from Liouville gravity. Finally, we use the properties of these volumes to recover Mirzakhani's recursion formula for Weil-Petersson polynomials. This provides a new proof of Witten-Kontsevich's theorem.</description>

      <title>Linear first order differential operators and their Hutchinson-invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of a new interrelation between linear ordinary differential operators and complex dynamics which we discuss in details in the simplest case of operators of order $1$. Namely, assuming that such an operator $T$ has polynomial coefficients, we interpret it as a continuous family of Hutchinson operators acting on the space of positive powers of linear forms. Using this interpretation of $T$, we introduce its continuously Hutchinson invariant subsets of the complex plane and investigate a variety of their properties. In particular, we prove that for any $T$ with non-constant coefficients, there exists a unique minimal under inclusion invariant set $\mathrm{M}^T_{CH}$ and find explixitly when it equals $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff generic points on curves in horospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{a_t: t \in \mathbb{R}\}&lt; SL_{d}(\mathbb{R})$ be a diagonalizable subgroup whose expanding horospherical subgroup $U &lt; SL_{d}(\mathbb{R})$ is abelian. By the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, for any $x \in SL_{d}(\mathbb{R})/SL_{d}(\mathbb{Z})$ and for almost every point $u \in U$ the point $ux$ is Birkhoff generic for $a_t$ when $t \to \infty$. We prove that the same is true when $U$ is replaced by any non-degenerate analytic curve in $U$. This Birkhoff genericity result has various applications in Diophantine approximation. For instance, we obtain density estimates for Dirichlet improvability along typical points on a curve in Euclidean space. Other applications address approximations by algebraic numbers and best approximations (in the sense of Lagarias).</description>

      <title>Unbounded Perturbation of Linear Partial Functional Differential Equations via Yosida Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with perturbation of evolution equation with delay $u'(t)=Au(t)+Bu_t \ (*)$ where $A,B$ are linear operators in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ and from $C([-r,0],\mathbb{X})$ to $\mathbb{X}$, respectively; $r&gt;0$ is a given constant. To measure the size of unbounded perturbation we introduce the so-called \textit{Yosida distance} of linear operators $U$ and $V$ in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ as $d_Y(U,V):=\limsup_{\mu\to +\infty} \| U_\mu-V_\mu\|$, where $U_\mu$ and $V_\mu$ are the Yosida approximations of $U$ and $V$, respectively. The obtained results states that if $d_Y(A, A_1)$ and $d_Y(B, B_1)$ are sufficiently small, then the equation $u'(t)=A_1u(t)+B_1u_t \ (**)$ also has an exponential dichotomy, if (*) has it. The proofs are based on estimates of the Yosida distance of the generators of the solution semigroups generated by (*) and (**) in the phase space $C([-r,0],\mathbb{X})$ whose domains have no relations at all. The obtained results seem to be new.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control for Suppressing Chaotic Response to Dynamic Hydrogen Blending in a Gas Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that periodic forcing of nonlinear flows can result in a chaotic response under certain conditions. Such non-periodic and chaotic solutions have been observed in simulations of heterogeneous gas flow in a pipeline with periodic, time-varying boundary conditions. In this paper, we examine a proportional feedback law for boundary control of a parabolic partial differential equation system that represents the flow of two gases through a pipe. We demonstrate that periodic variation of the mass fraction of the lighter gas at the pipe inlet can result in the chaotic propagation of gas pressure waves, and show that appropriate flow control can suppress this response. We examine phase space solutions for the single pipe system subject to boundary control, and use numerical experiments to characterize conditions for the controller gain to suppress chaos.</description>

      <title>StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this "curse of memory" as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.</description>

      <title>Variational Mode Decomposition-Based Nonstationary Coherent Structure Analysis for Spatiotemporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional modal analysis techniques face difficulties in handling nonstationary phenomena, such as transient, nonperiodic, or intermittent phenomena. This paper presents a variational mode decomposition--based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS) analysis that enables the extraction and analysis of coherent structures in the case of nonstationary phenomena from high-dimensional spatiotemporal data. The VMD-NCS analysis decomposes the input spatiotemporal data into intrinsic coherent structures (ICSs) that represent nonstationary spatiotemporal patterns and exhibit coherence in both spatial and temporal directions. Unlike many conventional modal analysis techniques, the proposed method accounts for the temporal changes in the spatial distribution with time. Tthe VMD-NCS analysis was validated based on the transient growth phenomena in the flow around a cylinder. It was confirmed that the temporal changes in the spatial distribution, depicting the transient growth of vortex shedding where fluctuations arising in the far-wake region gradually approach the near-wake region, were represented as a single ICS. Furthermore, in the analysis of the quasi-periodic flow field around a pitching airfoil, the temporal changes in the spatial distribution and the amplitude of vortex shedding behind the airfoil, influenced by the pitching motion of the airfoil, were captured as a single ICS. The impact of two parameters that control the number of ICSs ($K$) and the penalty factor related to the temporal coherence ($\alpha$), was investigated. The results revealed that $K$ has a significant impact on the VMD-NCS analysis results. In the case of a relatively high $K$, the VMD-NCS analysis tends to extract more periodic spatiotemporal patterns resembling the results of dynamic mode decomposition. In the case of a small $K$, it tends to extract more nonstationary spatiotemporal patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the logarithmic moments of the smallest denominator of all rationals in a shrinking interval with random center. Convergence follows from the more general results in [arXiv:2310.11251, Bull. Lond. Math. Soc., to appear], and the key point of this note is the derivation of explicit formulas for the moments of the limit distribution in dimension one. This answers questions raised by Meiss and Sander in their numerical study of minimal resonance orders for torus maps with random rotation vectors [arXiv:2310.11600].</description>
