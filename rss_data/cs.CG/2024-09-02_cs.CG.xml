      <title>Best of two worlds: Cartesian sampling and volume computation for distance-constrained configuration spaces using Cayley coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volume calculation of configurational spaces acts as a vital part in configurational entropy calculation, which contributes towards calculating free energy landscape for molecular systems. In this article, we present our sampling-based volume computation method using distance-based Cayley coordinate, mitigating drawbacks: our method guarantees that the sampling procedure stays in lower-dimensional coordinate space (instead of higher-dimensional Cartesian space) throughout the whole process; and our mapping function, utilizing Cayley parameterization, can be applied in both directions with low computational cost. Our method uniformly samples and computes a discrete volume measure of a Cartesian configuration space of point sets satisfying systems of distance inequality constraints. The systems belong to a large natural class whose feasible configuration spaces are effectively lower dimensional subsets of high dimensional ambient space. Their topological complexity makes discrete volume computation challenging, yet necessary in several application scenarios including free energy calculation in soft matter assembly modeling. The algorithm runs in linear time and empirically sub-linear space in the number of grid hypercubes (used to define the discrete volume measure) \textit{that intersect} the configuration space. In other words, the number of wasted grid cube visits is insignificant compared to prevailing methods typically based on gradient descent. Specifically, the traversal stays within the feasible configuration space by viewing it as a branched covering, using a recent theory of Cayley or distance coordinates to convexify the base space, and by employing a space-efficient, frontier hypercube traversal data structure. A software implementation and comparison with existing methods is provided.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Anchored Multiwatchman Routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some variants of the $k$-\textsc{Watchman Routes} problem, the cooperative version of the classic \textsc{Watchman Routes} problem in a simple polygon. The watchmen may be required to see the whole polygon, or some pre-determined quota of area within the polygon, and we want to minimize the maximum length traveled by any watchman. While the single watchman version of the problem has received much attention is rather well understood, it is not the case for multiple watchmen version.
  We provide the first tight approximability results for the anchored $k$-\textsc{Watchman Routes} problem in a simple polygon, assuming $k$ is fixed, by a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme. The basis for the FPTAS is provided by an exact dynamic programming algorithm. If $k$ is a variable, we give constant-factor approximations.</description>

      <title>Unfairly Splitting Separable Necklaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Necklace Splitting problem is a classical problem in combinatorics that has been intensively studied both from a combinatorial and a computational point of view. It is well-known that the Necklace Splitting problem reduces to the discrete Ham Sandwich problem. This reduction was crucial in the proof of PPA-completeness of the Ham Sandwich problem. Recently, Borzechowski, Schnider and Weber [ISAAC'23] introduced a variant of Necklace Splitting that similarly reduces to the $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich problem, which lies in the complexity class UEOPL but is not known to be complete. To make this reduction work, the input necklace is guaranteed to be n-separable. They showed that these necklaces can be fairly split in polynomial time and thus this subproblem cannot be used to prove UEOPL-hardness for $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich. We consider the more general unfair necklace splitting problem on n-separable necklaces, i.e., the problem of splitting these necklaces such that each thief gets a desired fraction of each type of jewels. This more general problem is the natural necklace-splitting-type version of $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich, and its complexity status is one of the main open questions posed by Borzechowski, Schnider and Weber. We show that the unfair splitting problem is also polynomial-time solvable, and can thus also not be used to show UEOPL-hardness for $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich.</description>

      <title>Upward Pointset Embeddings of Planar st-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study upward pointset embeddings (UPSEs) of planar $st$-graphs. Let $G$ be a planar $st$-graph and let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|= |V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$ that maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the problem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and the problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing is NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed $st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is possible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and to enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an $n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which can be tested in $O(n \log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an algorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing monotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$ space, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.</description>

      <title>A Universal Triangulation for Flat Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result due to Burago and Zalgaller (1960, 1995) states that every orientable polyhedral surface, one that is obtained by gluing Euclidean polygons, has an isometric piecewise linear (PL) embedding into Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$. A flat torus, resulting from the identification of the opposite sides of a Euclidean parallelogram, is a simple example of polyhedral surface. In a first part, we adapt the proof of Burago and Zalgaller, which is partially non-constructive, to produce PL isometric embeddings of flat tori. Our implementation produces embeddings with a huge number of vertices, moreover distinct for every flat torus. In a second part, based on another construction of Zalgaller (2000) and on recent works by Arnoux et al. (2021), we exhibit a universal triangulation with 2434 triangles which can be embedded linearly on each triangle in order to realize the metric of any flat torus.</description>

      <title>Differentiability and Optimization of Multiparameter Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-valued functions on geometric data -- such as node attributes on a graph -- can be optimized using descriptors from persistent homology, allowing the user to incorporate topological terms in the loss function. When optimizing a single real-valued function (the one-parameter setting), there is a canonical choice of descriptor for persistent homology: the barcode. The operation mapping a real-valued function to its barcode is differentiable almost everywhere, and the convergence of gradient descent for losses using barcodes is relatively well understood. When optimizing a vector-valued function (the multiparameter setting), there is no unique choice of descriptor for multiparameter persistent homology, and many distinct descriptors have been proposed. This calls for the development of a general framework for differentiability and optimization that applies to a wide range of multiparameter homological descriptors. In this article, we develop such a framework and show that it encompasses well-known descriptors of different flavors, such as signed barcodes and the multiparameter persistence landscape. We complement the theory with numerical experiments supporting the idea that optimizing multiparameter homological descriptors can lead to improved performances compared to optimizing one-parameter descriptors, even when using the simplest and most efficiently computable multiparameter descriptors.</description>

      <title>On the bottleneck stability of rank decompositions of multi-parameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant part of modern topological data analysis is concerned with the design and study of algebraic invariants of poset representations -- often referred to as multi-parameter persistence modules. One such invariant is the minimal rank decomposition, which encodes the ranks of all the structure morphisms of the persistence module by a single ordered pair of rectangle-decomposable modules, interpreted as a signed barcode. This signed barcode generalizes the concept of persistence barcode from one-parameter persistence to any number of parameters, raising the question of its bottleneck stability. We show in this paper that the minimal rank decomposition is not stable under the natural notion of signed bottleneck matching between signed barcodes. We remedy this by turning our focus to the rank exact decomposition, a related signed barcode induced by the minimal projective resolution of the module relative to the so-called rank exact structure, which we prove to be bottleneck stable under signed matchings. As part of our proof, we obtain two intermediate results of independent interest: we compute the global dimension of the rank exact structure on the category of finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence modules, and we prove a bottleneck stability result for hook-decomposable modules. We also give a bound for the size of the rank exact decomposition that is polynomial in the size of the usual minimal projective resolution, we prove a universality result for the dissimilarity function induced by the notion of signed matching, and we compute, in the two-parameter case, the global dimension of a different exact structure related to the upsets of the indexing poset. This set of results combines concepts from topological data analysis and from the representation theory of posets, and we believe is relevant to both areas.</description>
