      <description>arXiv:2510.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher information matrix is used widely in astronomy (and presumably other fields) to forecast the precision of future experiments while they are still in the design phase. Although many sources describe the mathematics of the formalism, few sources offer simple examples to help the beginner. This pedagogical document works through a few simple examples to develop conceptual understanding of the applications.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Being Adaptable: An Exploration of the Power and Limitations of Domain Adaptation for Simulation-Based Inference with Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep machine learning methods in astronomy has exploded in the last decade, with new models showing remarkably improved performance on benchmark tasks. Not nearly enough attention is given to understanding the models' robustness, especially when the test data are systematically different from the training data, or "out of domain." Domain shift poses a significant challenge for simulation-based inference, where models are trained on simulated data but applied to real observational data. In this paper, we explore domain shift and test domain adaptation methods for a specific scientific case: simulation-based inference for estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray profiles. We build datasets to mimic simulation-based inference: a training set from the Magneticum simulation, a scatter-augmented training set to capture uncertainties in scaling relations, and a test set derived from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We demonstrate that the Test Set is out of domain in subtle ways that would be difficult to detect without careful analysis. We apply three deep learning methods: a standard neural network (NN), a neural network trained on the scatter-augmented input catalogs, and a Deep Reconstruction-Regression Network (DRRN), a semi-supervised deep model engineered to address domain shift. Although the NN improves results by 17% in the Training Data, it performs 40% worse on the out-of-domain Test Set. Surprisingly, the Scatter-Augmented Neural Network (SANN) performs similarly. While the DRRN is successful in mapping the training and Test Data onto the same latent space, it consistently underperforms compared to a straightforward Yx scaling relation. These results serve as a warning that simulation-based inference must be handled with extreme care, as subtle differences between training simulations and observational data can lead to unforeseen biases creeping into the results.</description>

      <title>Time-Dilation Methods for Extreme Multiscale Timestepping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many astrophysical simulations involve extreme dynamic range of timescales around 'special points' in the domain (e.g. black holes, stars, planets, disks, galaxies, shocks, mixing interfaces), where processes on small scales couple strongly to those on large scales. Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and hybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial, physics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following the long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical timestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating simulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling this in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then projected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming in and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is modulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch factor $a({\bf x},\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches (including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and ensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and derive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to ensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different physics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes it possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear scale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is flexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and limitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these methods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be used to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>GMIMS-DRAGONS: A Faraday Depth Survey of the Northern Sky Covering 350 to 1030 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized synchrotron emission at meter to centimeter wavelengths provides an effective tracer of the Galactic magnetic field. Calculating Faraday depth, the most useful parameter for mapping the line-of-sight magnetic field, requires observations covering wide frequency bands with many channels. As part of the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey we have observed polarized emission spanning 350-1030 MHz over the Northern sky, in the declination range ${-20^{\circ}}\leq{\delta}\leq{90^{\circ}}$. We used the 15 m telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), equipped to receive orthogonal circular polarizations, with the Onsala Space Observatory band-1 feed developed for the Square Kilometre Array. Angular resolution varies across the band from $1.3^{\circ}$ to $3.6^{\circ}$. A digital spectrometer provided 42 kHz frequency resolution. Data were taken with the telescope moving rapidly in azimuth and are absolutely calibrated in intensity. Approximately 20% of the band was obscured by radio-frequency interference. Resolution in Faraday depth is $\sim6$ rad m$^{-2}$, and features as wide as $\sim38$ rad m$^{-2}$ are represented. The median sensitivity of the Faraday depth cube is 11 mK. Approximately 55% of sight-lines in this survey show Faraday complexity. This dataset, called ``DRAO GMIMS of the Northern Sky'' (DRAGONS), is the first to probe Faraday depth of the Northern sky in its frequency range and will support many scientific investigations. The data will be used to calibrate surveys with higher angular resolution, particularly Galactic foreground maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, and to provide information on large structures for aperture-synthesis telescopes, particularly the DRAO Synthesis Telescope. The data are available through the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.</description>

      <title>A quantitative performance analysis of two different interferometric alignment sensing schemes for gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise laser alignment in optical cavities is essential for high-precision laser interferometry. We report on a table-top optical experiment featuring two alignment sensing schemes: the conventional Wavefront Sensing (WFS) scheme which uses quadrant photodetectors (QPDs) to recover optical alignment, and the newly developed Radio Frequency Jitter Alignment Sensing (RFJAS) scheme, which uses an electro-optic beam deflector (EOBD) to apply fast angular modulation. This work evaluates the performance of RFJAS through a direct, side-by-side comparison with WFS. We present a detailed noise budget for both techniques, with particular emphasis on limitations at low frequencies, below 30\,Hz. Our results show that WFS performance is constrained by technical noise arising from beam spot motion (BSM), mainly due to beam miscentering on QPDs. In contrast, RFJAS is primarily limited by residual RF amplitude modulation. A blended scheme that combines both sensing methods may offer the most practical approach for use in gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO.</description>

      <title>The survival of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aromaticity is a common chemical functionalities in bioactive molecules. In interstellar and circumstellar environments benzene and other small aromatics are considered the precursor for more complex prebiotic molecules and they have shown to potentially have rich ice-phase photochemistry. The availability of small organic molecules in prebiotic networks depends on their photostability in astrophysical environments preceding planet formation, particularly during the protoplanetary disk stage, as the disk composition is linked to the chemical make-up of planets and planetesimals. We study the ultraviolet (UV) photodestruction (120-160 nm) of five aromatic molecules in undiluted ices and, for selected cases, in astrophysically relevant ice matrices (H2O, CO, CO2). For each ice, we measure the destruction cross sections as a function of photon exposure. In undiluted ices, aromatic molecules exhibit substantially lower photodestruction cross sections (sigma &lt; 10-19 cm2) than aliphatic hydrocarbons, including cyclohexane, (sigma = 2.8-4x10-18 cm2). Furthermore, neither substituent nature nor size affects the aromatic stability in pure ices, suggesting that the strong intermolecular interactions among aromatic molecules provide protection against VUV exposure, even with small to mid-sized ring substituents. In mixed ices, the photodestruction and reactivity of aromatic molecules (sigma = 2.5-6.1x10-18 cm2) increases by more than an order of magnitude, but are still lower than in the gas-phase. We attribute this to a weaker cage effect and matrix-specific interactions. We use the experimental photodestruction cross sections to estimate the lifetime of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks, denileating the disks regions in which aromatic photochemistry is expected to be the most active.</description>

      <title>AMIGO: a Data-Driven Calibration of the JWST Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) hosts a non-redundant Aperture Masking Interferometer (AMI) in its Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument, providing the only dedicated interferometric facility aboard - magnitudes more precise than any interferometric experiment previously flown. However, the performance of AMI (and other high resolution approaches such as kernel phase) in recovery of structure at high contrasts has not met design expectations. A major contributing factor has been the presence of uncorrected detector systematics, notably charge migration effects in the H2RG sensor, and insufficiently accurate mask metrology. Here we present Amigo, a data-driven calibration framework and analysis pipeline that forward-models the full JWST AMI system - including its optics, detector physics, and readout electronics - using an end-to-end differentiable architecture implemented in the Jax framework and in particular exploiting the dLux optical modelling package. Amigo directly models the generation of up-the-ramp detector reads, using an embedded neural sub-module to capture non-linear charge redistribution effects, enabling the optimal extraction of robust observables, for example kernel amplitudes and phases, while mitigating systematics such as the brighter-fatter effect. We demonstrate Amigo's capabilities by recovering the ABDor AC binary from commissioning data with high-precision astrometry, and detecting both HD206893B and the inner substellar companion HD206893c: a benchmark requiring contrasts approaching 10 magnitudes at separations of only 100 mas. These results exceed outcomes from all published pipelines, and re-establish AMI as a viable competitor for imaging at high contrast at the diffraction limit. Amigo is publicly available as open-source software community resource.</description>

      <title>An FPCA-Enhanced Ensemble Learning Framework for Photometric Identification of Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are essential tools for addressing key cosmic questions, including the Hubble tension and the nature of dark energy. Modern surveys are predominantly photometry-based, making the construction of a clean photometric SNe Ia sample crucial. In this study, we investigate whether functional principal component analysis (FPCA) scores derived from photometric light curves, combined with ensemble learning, can reliably distinguish SNe Ia from other transients using the PLAsTiCC dataset. FPCA provides a data-driven, flexible characterization of light curves without relying on rigid theoretical model assumptions. Light curves are fitted by minimizing residuals with penalty terms from clean samples, making the method robust to outliers or poorly sampled bands. The first two FPCA scores and peak magnitudes across the five LSST bands are used as classification features. We implement two complementary binary classifiers: an ensemble boosting model (CatBoost) and a statistical probabilistic method based on Euclidean distances. CatBoost slightly outperforms the statistical method, achieving 98.5% accuracy and 97.8% precision. Performance remains robust (&gt;90%) under typical photometric redshift uncertainties ({\sigma} = 0.1). On the spectroscopic DES Y5 sample, both methods reach approximately 90% accuracy and 95% precision, demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods with limited cross-survey applicability. Applied to DECam DDF and DESIRT transients, the predictions strongly agree, and their intersection provides a high-confidence SNe Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Overall, this FPCA-based framework offers a powerful, flexible tool for classifying transients in upcoming large-scale surveys such as LSST and Roman.</description>

      <title>Photo-$z$ Estimation with Normalizing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation is a key challenge in cosmology, as uncertainties in photo-$z$ directly limit the scientific return of large-scale structure and weak lensing studies, especially in upcoming Stage IV surveys. The problem is particularly severe for faint galaxies with sparse spectroscopic training data. In this work, we introduce nflow-$z$, a novel photo-$z$ estimation method using the powerful machine learning technique of normalizing flow (NF). nflow-$z$ explicitly models the redshift probability distribution conditioned on the observables such as fluxes and colors. We build two nflow-$z$ implementations, dubbed cINN and cNSF, and compare their performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nflow-$z$ on several datasets, including a CSST mock, the COSMOS2020 catalog, and samples from DES Y1, SDSS, and DESCaLS. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art algorithms shows that nflow-$z$ performs favorably. For instance, cNSF surpasses Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neutral Network on the CSST mock test. We also achieve a ~30\% improvement over official results for the faint DESCaLS sample and outperform conditional Generative Adversarial Network and Mixture Density Network methods on the DES Y1 dataset test. Furthermore, nflow-$z$ is computationally efficient, requiring only a fraction of the computing time of some of the competing algorithms. Our algorithm is particularly effective for the faint sample with sparse training data, making it highly suitable for upcoming Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>Beamforming in Interferometer Arrays with Cross-couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an interferometric array, an image of the sky can be synthesized from interferometric visibilities, which are the cross-correlations of the received electric voltages of pairs of array elements. However, to search for transient targets such as the fast radio burst (FRB), it is more convenient to use the beam-forming technique, where the real-time voltage outputs of the array elements are used to generate data streams (beams) which are sensitive to a specific direction. This is usually achieved by a weighted sum of the array element voltages, with the complex weight adjusted so that all outputs have the same phase for that direction. Alternatively, beams can also be formed from the weighted sum of the short time averaged correlation (visibility) data. We shall call these two approaches the electric voltage beam forming (EBF) and cross-correlation beam forming (XBF), respectively. All beams formed with the EBF can also be formed by the XBF method, but the latter can also generate beams which can not be generated by the former. We discuss the properties of these two kinds of beams, and the amount of computation required in each case. For an array with large number of elements, the XBF would require much more computation resource, although this is partly compensated by the fact that it allows integration over time. We study the impact of cross-coupling between array elements on the beamforming, first using a toy model, then for the case of the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array. In both cases, we find that the impact of the cross-coupling on the beam profile is relatively small. The understanding gained in this study is helpful in designing and understanding the beam-forming FRB digital backend for compact arrays such as the Tianlai array.</description>

      <title>An efficient spectral Poisson solver for the nirvana-III code: the shearing-box case with vertical vacuum boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. - Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Energy of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Registered with a Fluorescence Telescope: One Time Frame Might Be Enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of reconstructing the energy of three ultra-high-energy cosmic rays registered with a small fluorescence telescope EUSO-TA that operated in 2015 at the site of the Telescope Array experiment in Utah, USA. Each of these events was recorded within one time frame. Conventional methods of energy reconstruction are not applicable in this case because the events do not have light curves but a single data point. As an alternative, we consider a number of approaches based on artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that a signal recorded by a fluorescence telescope within one time frame might be enough to reconstruct the energy of a primary particle with reasonable accuracy using an ensemble of simple convolutional neural networks. Contrary to the conventional approach, reconstruction of the shower geometry is not needed for this. More than this, preliminary estimates can be obtained even without recognizing the shower track. However, there remain some problems that do not allow us to claim that the suggested method is universal and always works. We discuss difficulties that we faced and possible ways of improving the method.</description>

      <title>Slitless Spectroscopy Source Detection Using YOLO Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slitless spectroscopy eliminates the need for slits, allowing light to pass directly through a prism or grism to generate a spectral dispersion image that encompasses all celestial objects within a specified area. This technique enables highly efficient spectral acquisition. However, when processing CSST slitless spectroscopy data, the unique design of its focal plane introduces a challenge: photometric and slitless spectroscopic images do not have a one-to-one correspondence. As a result, it becomes essential to first identify and count the sources in the slitless spectroscopic images before extracting spectra. To address this challenge, we employed the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm to develop a model for detecting targets in slitless spectroscopy images. This model was trained on 1,560 simulated CSST slitless spectroscopic images. These simulations were generated from the CSST Cycle 6 and Cycle 9 main survey data products, representing the Galactic and nearby galaxy regions and the high galactic latitude regions, respectively. On the validation set, the model achieved a precision of 88.6% and recall of 90.4% for spectral lines, and 87.0% and 80.8% for zeroth-order images. In testing, it maintained a detection rate &gt;80% for targets brighter than 21 mag (medium-density regions) and 20 mag (low-density regions) in the Galactic and nearby galaxies regions, and &gt;70% for targets brighter than 18 mag in high galactic latitude regions.</description>

      <title>Image reconstruction with the JWST Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) above Earth's turbulent atmosphere, the Aperture Masking Interferometer (AMI) on the NIRISS instrument is the highest-resolution infrared interferometer ever placed in space. However, its performance was found to be limited by non-linear detector systematics, particularly charge migration - or the Brighter-Fatter Effect. Conventional interferometric Fourier observables are degraded by non-linear transformations in the image plane, with the consequence that the inner working angle and contrast limits of AMI were seriously compromised. Building on the end-to-end differentiable model &amp; calibration code amigo, we here present a regularised maximum-likelihood image reconstruction framework dorito which can deconvolve AMI images either in the image plane or from calibrated Fourier observables, achieving high angular resolution and contrast over a wider field of view than conventional interferometric limits. This modular code by default includes regularisation by maximum entropy, and total variation defined with $l_1$ or $l_2$ metrics. We present imaging results from dorito for three benchmark imaging datasets: the volcanoes of Jupiter's moon Io, the colliding-wind binary dust nebula WR 137 and the archetypal Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus NGC 1068. In all three cases we recover images consistent with the literature at diffraction-limited resolutions. The performance, limitations, and future opportunities enabled by amigo for AMI imaging (and beyond) are discussed.</description>

      <title>Using chromatic covariance to correct for scintillation noise in ground-based spectrophotometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric scintillation is one of the largest sources of error in ground-based spectrophotometry, reducing the precision of astrophysical signals extracted from the time-series of bright objects to that of much fainter objects. Relative to the fundamental Poisson noise, scintillation is not effectively reduced by observing with larger telescopes, and alternative solutions are needed to maximize the spectrophotometric precision of large telescopes. If the chromatic covariance of the scintillation is known, it can be used to reduce the scintillation noise in spectrophotometry. This paper derives analytical solutions for the chromatic covariance of stellar scintillation on a large telescope for a given atmospheric turbulence profile, wind speed, wind direction, and airmass at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. To demonstrate how scintillation noise is isolated, scintillation-limited exoplanet transit spectroscopy is simulated. Then, a procedure is developed to remove scintillation noise and produce Poisson-noise limited light curves. The efficacy and limits of this technique will be tested with on sky observations of a new, high spectrophotometric precision, low resolution spectrograph.</description>

      <title>Argus: JAX state-space filtering for gravitational wave detection with a pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argus is a high-performance Python package for detecting and characterising nanohertz gravitational waves in pulsar timing array data. The package provides a complete Bayesian inference framework based on state-space models, using Kalman filtering for efficient likelihood evaluation. Argus leverages JAX for just-in-time compilation, GPU acceleration, and automatic differentiation, facilitating rapid Bayesian inference with gradient-based samplers. The state-space approach provides a computationally efficient alternative to traditional frequency-domain methods, offering linear scaling with the number of pulse times-of-arrival, and natural handling of non-stationary processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large-scale radio surveys, generating over 100 petabytes of data annually, has created a pressing need for automated data analysis methods. Recent research has explored the application of machine learning techniques to address the challenges associated with detecting and classifying radio galaxies, as well as discovering peculiar radio sources. This paper provides an overview of our investigations with the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, detailing the methodologies employed-including supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised learning approaches -- and their implications for ongoing and future radio astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Photometry for Deconfusion of Directly Imaged Multi-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planned and future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will aim to directly image Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars in reflected light. Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not know in advance which point source detection corresponds to which planet. This "confusion" problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high occurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of prior knowledge about planets' orbital parameters or characteristics, particularly for systems at high inclination with respect to the observer. This work addresses the confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new orbit ranking function to augment the "deconfuser" tool and account for phase variation exhibited by a planet throughout its orbit. We demonstrate the new ranking scheme on a subset of thirty highly confused simulated multi-planet systems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). Results indicate that photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits in 7/10 of the low inclination cases, 6/10 of the medium inclination cases, and 6/10 of the high inclination cases. This improvement in handling highly confused systems emphasizes that photometry shows promise for supporting orbit discrimination and deconfusion of directly imaged multi-planet systems, and should be considered when fitting orbits to detections.</description>

      <title>Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES): Selection of targets for the Wide survey using decision-tree classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES) on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) includes two flux-limited subsurveys with very high (95\%) completeness requirements: Wide over $\sim\!1200$ deg$^2$ and Deep over $\sim\!65$ deg$^2$. Both are $Z$-band selected, respectively as $Z&lt;21.1$ and $Z&lt;21.25$ mag, and additionally redshift-limited, while the true redshifts are not known a priori but will be only measured by 4MOST. Here, we present a classification-based method to select the targets for WAVES-Wide. Rather than estimating individual redshifts for the input photometric objects, we assign probabilities of them being below $z=0.2$, the redshift limit of the subsurvey. This is done with the supervised machine learning approach of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), trained on a comprehensive spectroscopic sample overlapping with WAVES fields. Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes from $u$ to $K_s$ and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the classification are the $g$-band and the $u-g$, $g-r$ and $J-K_s$ colors. We check the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide limits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude thresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of 94-95\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close to the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic training sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply the classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million photometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands measured. Our work demonstrates that a machine-learning classifier could be used to select a flux- and redshift-limited sample from deep photometric data.</description>

      <title>Interoperability From OpenTelemetry to Kieker: Demonstrated as Export from the Astronomy Shop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observability framework Kieker provides a range of analysis capabilities, but it is currently only able to instrument a smaller selection of languages and technologies, including Java, C, Fortran, and Python. The OpenTelemetry standard aims for providing reference implementations for most programming languages, including C# and JavaScript, that are currently not supported by Kieker. In this work, we describe how to transform OpenTelemetry tracing data into the Kieker framework. Thereby, it becomes possible to create for example call trees from OpenTelemetry instrumentations. We demonstrate the usability of our approach by visualizing trace data of the Astronomy Shop, which is an OpenTelemetry demo application.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing and resampling: a guide to utilising posterior samples from gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories have opened new scientific research in astrophysics, fundamental physics, and cosmology. The collaborations that build and operate these observatories release the interferometric strain data as well as a catalogue of observed signals with accompanying Bayesian posterior distributions. These posteriors, in the form of equally-weighted samples, form a dataset that is used by a multitude of further analyses seeking to constrain the population of merging black holes, identify lensed pairs of signals, and much more. However, many of these analyses rely, often implicitly, on the ability to reconstruct the likelihood and prior from the inputs to the analysis and apply resampling (a statistical technique to generate new samples varying the underlying analysis assumptions). In this work, we first provide a guide on how to reconstruct and modify the posterior density accurately from the inputs for analyses performed with the Bilby inference library. We then demonstrate and compare resampling techniques to produce new posterior sample sets and discuss Pareto-smoothing to improve the efficiency. Finally, we provide examples of how to use resampling to study observed gravitational-wave signals. We hope this guide provides a useful resource for those wishing to use open data products from the LVK for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Data Quality and Decay in Mega-Constellations: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly available information has become fundamental for satellite operators to guarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space environment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds, planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m, while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in mega-constellations.</description>

      <title>JADES Dark Horse: demonstrating high-multiplex observations with JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy in the JADES Origins Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W&lt;30 mag) z$_{\rm phot}$&gt;3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5&lt;z&lt;8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (&lt;200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at $\lambda$~4 $\mu$m, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.</description>

Abstract: In astrophysical simulations, nuclear reacting flows pose computational challenges due to the stiffness of reaction networks. We introduce neural network-based surrogate models using the DeePODE framework to enhance simulation efficiency while maintaining accuracy and robustness. Our method replaces conventional stiff ODE solvers with deep learning models trained through evolutionary Monte Carlo sampling from zero-dimensional simulation data, ensuring generalization across varied thermonuclear and hydrodynamic conditions. Tested on 3-species and 13-species reaction networks, the models achieve $\lesssim 1\%$ accuracy relative to semi-implicit numerical solutions and deliver a $\sim 2.6\times$ speedup on CPUs. A temperature-thresholded deployment strategy ensures stability in extreme conditions, sustaining neural network utilization above 75\% in multi-dimensional simulations. These data-driven surrogates effectively mitigate stiffness constraints, offering a scalable approach for high-fidelity modeling of astrophysical nuclear reacting flows.</description>

      <title>Bayesian recalibration of flux scale factors in diffuse radio maps using low-resolution absolute radiometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Haslam 408 MHz all-sky map is widely used as a template to model the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission at radio and microwave frequencies. Recent studies have suggested that there are large uncorrected flux scale errors in this map, however. We investigate the possibility of statistically recalibrating the Haslam map using absolutely-calibrated (but low angular resolution) radio experiments designed to measure the 21cm global signal at low frequencies. We construct a Gibbs sampling scheme to recover the full joint posterior distribution of $\sim 50,000$ parameters, representing the true sky brightness temperature field, as-yet uncorrected flux scale factors, and synchrotron power-law spectral indices. Using idealised full-sky simulated data, we perform a joint analysis of a $1^\circ$ resolution diffuse map at 408 MHz and multi-band 21cm global signal data with $30^\circ$ resolution under different assumptions about 1) noise levels in the maps, 2) sky coverage, and 3) synchrotron spectral index information. For our fiducial scenario in which the global signal experiment has a 50 mK noise rms per coarse pixel in each of 20 frequency bins between 50 -- 150 MHz -- the typical range for a global signal experiment,, we find that the notional Haslam flux scale factors can be recovered in most (but not all) sub-regions of the sky to an accuracy of $\pm 2 \%$. In all cases we are able to rectify the sky map to within $\sim 5$ K of the true brightness temperature. Our method can be used to correct the Haslam map once maps obtained from global experiments are available.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using Deep Loop Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</description>

      <title>Searching for Free-Floating Planets with TESS: Results from Sectors 61-65</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though free-floating planets (FFPs) may outpopulate their bound counterparts in the terrestrial-mass range, they remain one of the least explored exoplanet demographics. Due to their negligible electromagnetic emission at all wavelengths, the only observational technique able to detect these worlds is gravitational microlensing. Microlensing by terrestrial-mass FFPs induces rare, short-duration magnifications of background stars, requiring high-cadence, wide-field surveys to detect these events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), though designed to detect close-bound exoplanets via transits, boasts a Full-Frame Image cadence as short as 200 seconds and has monitored hundreds of millions of stars, providing a unique dataset in which to search for rare short-duration transients. We have performed a preliminary search for FFP microlensing in 7.5 million light curves from TESS Sectors 61 - 65. We find one short-duration event with a light curve morphology consistent with expectations for a low-mass FFP, but in tension with the expected FFP abundance in this mass range. We consider possible false positive interpretations of this event such as stellar flares, hearbeat binaries, and centrifugal breakout. We find that all interpretations pose some challenges, and discuss the possibility that the event may constitute a first example of a new class of pernicious false positives that future space-based microlensing efforts will encounter. Our ongoing search through the TESS dataset will significantly support the upcoming hunt for rogue worlds with dedicated space-based microlensing surveys, and our results may be used alongside these surveys to place interesting constraints on the spatial distribution of FFPs in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Markov Walk Exploration of Model Spaces: Bayesian Selection of Dark Energy Models with Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Central to model selection is a trade-off between performing a good fit and low model complexity: A model of higher complexity should only be favoured over a simpler model if it provides significantly better fits. In Bayesian terms, this can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices between two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing Markovian random walks for exploring the entire model space. In analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in parameter estimation problem, the process is governed by the logarithmic evidence ratio. We apply our methodology to selecting a polynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ on the basis of data for the supernova distance-redshift relation.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): I. Overview, Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling, and Stokes Profile Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our "SPIn4D" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\times25\times8$ Mm with $16\times16\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available, with 13.7 TB in the initial release.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen intensity mapping with MeerKAT: Preserving cosmological signal by optimising contaminant separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removing contaminants is a delicate, yet crucial step in neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping and often considered the technique's greatest challenge. Here, we address this challenge by analysing HI intensity maps of about $100$ deg$^2$ at redshift $z\approx0.4$ collected by the MeerKAT radio telescope, an SKA Observatory (SKAO) precursor, with a combined 10.5-hour observation. Using unsupervised statistical methods, we removed the contaminating foreground emission and systematically tested, step-by-step, some common pre-processing choices to facilitate the cleaning process. We also introduced and tested a novel multiscale approach: the data were redundantly decomposed into subsets referring to different spatial scales (large and small), where the cleaning procedure was performed independently. We confirm the detection of the HI cosmological signal in cross-correlation with an ancillary galactic data set, without the need to correct for signal loss. In the best set-up we achieved, we were able to constrain the HI distribution through the combination of its cosmic abundance ($\Omega_{HI}$) and linear clustering bias ($b_{HI}$) up to a cross-correlation coefficient ($r$). We measured $\Omega_{HI}b_{HI}r = [0.93 \pm 0.17]\,\times\,10^{-3}$ with a $\approx6\sigma$ confidence, which is independent of scale cuts at both edges of the probed scale range ($0.04 \lesssim k \lesssim 0.3 \,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$), corroborating its robustness. Our new pipeline has successfully found an optimal compromise in separating contaminants without incurring a catastrophic signal loss. This development instills an added degree of confidence in the outstanding science we can deliver with MeerKAT on the path towards HI intensity mapping surveys with the full SKAO.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Event Time Series with Sparse Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection, Similarity Search, and Unsupervised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</description>

      <title>Solar Flux Atlases: The new HARPS-N Quiet Sun Benchmark and Ca II H &amp; K Lines Continuum Normalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H &amp; K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...</description>

      <title>Prospects for dark matter observations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) orbiting the Milky Way are widely regarded as systems supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravity, and as prime targets for the search for indirect dark matter (DM) signatures in the GeV-to-TeV $\gamma$-ray range owing to their lack of astrophysical $\gamma$-ray background. We present forecasts of the sensitivity of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to annihilating or decaying DM signals in these targets. An original selection of candidates is performed from the current catalogue of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint dSphs. For each, the expected DM content is derived using the most comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic data available, within a consistent framework of analysis. This approach enables the derivation of novel astrophysical factor profiles for indirect DM searches, which are compared with results from the literature. From an initial sample of 64 dSphs, eight promising targets are identified -- Draco I, Coma Berenices, Ursa Major II, Ursa Minor and Willman 1 in the North, Reticulum II, Sculptor and Sagittarius II in the South -- for which different DM density models yield consistent expectations, leading to robust predictions. CTAO is expected to provide the strongest limits above $\sim$10 TeV, reaching velocity-averaged annihilation cross sections of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and decay lifetimes up to $\sim$10$^{26}$ s for combined limits. The dominant uncertainties arise from the imprecise determination of the DM content, particularly for ultra-faint dSphs. Observation strategies are proposed that optimise either deep exposures of the best candidates or diversified target selections.</description>
