      <title>Periodic systems have new classes of synchronization stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Master Stability Function is a robust and useful tool for determining the conditions of synchronization stability in a network of coupled systems. While a comprehensive classification exists in the case in which the nodes are chaotic dynamical systems, its application to periodic systems has been less explored. By studying several well-known periodic systems, we establish a comprehensive framework to understand and classify their properties of synchronizability. This allows us to define five distinct classes of synchronization stability, including some that are unique to periodic systems. Specifically, in periodic systems, the Master Stability Function vanishes at the origin, and it can therefore display behavioral classes that are not achievable in chaotic systems, where it starts, instead, at a strictly positive value. Moreover, our results challenge the widely-held belief that periodic systems are easily put in a stable synchronous state, showing, instead, the common occurrence of a lower threshold for synchronization stability.</description>

      <title>Emergence of condensation patterns in kinetic equations for opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we define a class of models to understand the impact of population size on opinion formation dynamics, a phenomenon usually related to group conformity. To this end, we introduce a new kinetic model in which the interaction frequency is weighted by the kinetic density. In the quasi-invariant regime, this model reduces to a Kaniadakis-Quarati-type equation with nonlinear drift, originally introduced for the dynamics of bosons in a spatially homogeneous setting. From the obtained PDE for the evolution of the opinion density, we determine the regime of parameters for which a critical mass exists and triggers blow-up of the solution. Therefore, the model is capable of describing strong conformity phenomena in cases where the total density of individuals holding a given opinion exceeds a fixed critical size. In the final part, several numerical experiments demonstrate the features of the introduced class of models and the related consensus effects.</description>

      <title>Simple fusion-fission quantifies Israel-Palestine violence and suggests multi-adversary solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why humans fight has no easy answer. However, understanding better how humans fight could inform future interventions, hidden shifts and casualty risk. Fusion-fission describes the well-known grouping behavior of fish etc. fighting for survival in the face of strong opponents: they form clusters ('fusion') which provide collective benefits and a cluster scatters when it senses danger ('fission'). Here we show how similar clustering (fusion-fission) of human fighters provides a unified quantitative explanation for complex casualty patterns across decades of Israel-Palestine region violence, as well as the October 7 surprise attack -- and uncovers a hidden post-October 7 shift. State-of-the-art data shows this fighter fusion-fission in action. It also predicts future 'super-shock' attacks that will be more lethal than October 7 and will arrive earlier. It offers a multi-adversary solution. Our results -- which include testable formulae and a plug-and-play simulation -- enable concrete risk assessments of future casualties and policy-making grounded by fighter behavior.</description>
