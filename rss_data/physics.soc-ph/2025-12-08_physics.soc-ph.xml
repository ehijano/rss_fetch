      <title>Opinion dynamics modelling: distinct attraction and repulsion topologies highlight quantitative effects of trolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of opinion dynamics based on networked non-linear differential equations. The model combines a linear attraction with a repulsive hyperbolic tangent interaction, labeled controversialness. For low controversialness the model displays universal consensus, which is typical of opinion models. As controversialness increases, opinion behaviours such as polarisation, clustering and dissensus emerge, dependent on the network topology. By placing attractive and repulsive interactions on distinct networks, this model is able to simulate the manipulative effects of trolls by introducing controversy, which may be associated with mis/disinformation, toxic messaging, and encouraging provocative questioning and/or emotional posting. This work offers an analytical and statistical analysis of model results, under a wide variety of topologies and initial conditions, whilst also generalising cluster detection algorithms typically applied to discrete models.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Rankings in Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of correlation in matching markets, where multiple decision-makers simultaneously face selection problems from the same pool of candidates. We propose a model in which a candidate's priority scores across different decision-makers exhibit varying levels of correlation dependent on the candidate's sociodemographic group. Such differential correlation can arise in school choice due to the varying prevalence of selection criteria, in college admissions due to test-optional policies, or due to algorithmic monoculture, that is, when decision-makers rely on the same algorithms and data sets to evaluate candidates. We show that higher correlation for one of the groups generally improves the outcome for all groups, leading to higher efficiency. However, students from a given group are more likely to remain unmatched as their own correlation level increases. This implies that it is advantageous to belong to a low-correlation group. Finally, we extend the tie-breaking literature to multiple priority classes and intermediate levels of correlation. Overall, our results point to differential correlation as a previously overlooked systemic source of group inequalities in school, university, and job admissions.</description>

      <title>The Power of Network Pluralism: Multi-Perspective Modeling of Heterogeneous Legal Document Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insights are relative - influenced by a range of factors such as assumptions, scopes, or methods that together define a research perspective. In normative and empirical fields alike, this insight has led to the conclusion that no single perspective can generate complete knowledge. As a response, epistemological pluralism mandates that researchers consider multiple perspectives simultaneously to obtain a holistic understanding of their phenomenon under study. Translating this mandate to network science, our work introduces Network Pluralism as a conceptual framework that leverages multi-perspectivity to yield more complete, meaningful, and robust results. We develop and demonstrate the benefits of this approach via a hands-on analysis of complex legal systems, constructing a network space from references across documents from different branches of government as well as including organizational hierarchy above and fine-grained structure below the document level. Leveraging the resulting heterogeneity in a multi-network analysis, we show how complementing perspectives can help contextualize otherwise high-level findings, how contrasting several networks derived from the same data enables researchers to learn by difference, and how relating metrics to perspectives may increase the transparency and robustness of network-analytical results. To analyze a space of networks as perspectives, researchers need to map dimensions of variation in a given domain to network-modeling decisions and network-metric parameters. While this remains a challenging and inherently interdisciplinary task, our work acts as a blueprint to facilitate the broader adoption of Network Pluralism in domain-driven network research.</description>

      <title>Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of delay discounting with bi-faceted impulsivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing mathematical models of delay discounting (e. g. exponential model, hyperbolic model, and those derived from nonextensive statistics) consider impulsivity as a single entity. However, the present article derives a novel mathematical model of delay discounting considering impulsivity as a multi-faceted quantity. It involves the bi-faceted characteristic of impulsivity, and considers impulsivity as a variable represented by two positive and fluctuating quantities (e.g. these facets may be trait and state impulsivity). To derive the model, the superstatistics method, which has been used to describe fluctuating physical systems like a thermal plasma, has been adapted. According to the standard practice in behavioural science, we first assume that the total impulsivity is a mere addition of the two facets. However, we also explore the possibility beyond an additive model and conclude that facets of impulsivity may also be combined in a non-additive way. We name this group of models the Extended Effective Exponential Model or $E^3M$. We find a good agreement between our model and experimental data.</description>
