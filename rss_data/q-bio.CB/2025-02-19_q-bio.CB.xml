      <title>Arrested development and traveling waves of active suspensions in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. An anchoring strength linking the active and passive media tunes the system between active suspension theory in Newtonian fluids in one limit, and active nematic theory in another. For small active Ericksen number or particle concentration the suspension settles to an equilibrium state with uniform alignment. Beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration, the suspension instead can buckle into a steady flowing state. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, the development is arrested by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber emerge at yet higher values of active Ericksen number, and a phase transition is identified at finite anchoring strength. If the active particles are motile, traveling waves emerge, including a traveling, oscillatory `thrashing' mode. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the arrested state.</description>

      <title>A universal formula explains cell size distributions in lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells actively regulate their size during the cell cycle to maintain volume homeostasis across generations. While various mathematical models of cell size regulation have been proposed to explain how this is achieved, relating these models to experimentally observed cell size distributions has proved challenging. In this paper we present a simple formula for the cell size distribution in lineages as observed in e.g. a mother machine, and provide a new derivation for the corresponding result in populations, assuming exponential cell growth. Our results are independent of the underlying cell size control mechanism and explain the characteristic shape underlying experimentally observed cell size distributions. We furthermore derive universal moment identities for these distributions, and show that our predictions agree well with experimental measurements of E. coli cells, both on the distribution and the moment level.</description>
