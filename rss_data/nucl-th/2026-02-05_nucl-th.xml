      <title>Mapping Nuclear Deformation with Differential Radial Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the radial flow of the fireball, usually characterized by transverse momentum spectra of final-state particles, encodes essential information about the hot and dense nuclear matter created in the collisions. However, the response of radial flow, including its $p_T$-differential structure $v_0(p_T)$ and longitudinal fluctuations $v_0(\eta)$, to intrinsic nuclear deformation remains unexplored. Using realistic $(3+1)$-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic calculations with Trento-3D initial conditions, we investigate how nuclear deformation affects the differential radial flow. We observe a clear, positive correlation between quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and radial flow: both magnitudes of $v_0$ and $v_0(p_T)$ are enhanced in central collisions when $\beta_2$ is increased. In contrast, the Pearson coefficient $\rho(n(p_T), [p_T])$ exhibits a universal step-like behavior across all collision systems and centralities. Further analysis of longitudinal decorrelation of radial flow reveals a rich structure: in central collisions, large $\beta_2$ tends to suppress the decorrelation, whereas hexadecapole deformation $\beta_4$ tends to enhance it. Such decorrelation effect increases toward peripheral collisions. Our results demonstrate that precise measurements of radial flow, spanning transverse momentum and longitudinal dependences, can provide powerful, complementary constraints on nuclear deformation in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Hyperon single-particle potentials in nuclear matter based on baryon-baryon interactions derived within chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of the Lambda and Sigma single-particle potentials is presented, based on YN interactions derived within chiral effective field theory up to next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO). The self-consistent Brueckner-Hartree-Fock framework is employed within the continuous choice for the single-particle potential. The result for the Lambda single-particle potential is comparable to the ones obtained with previous chiral YN interactions up to next-to-leading order (NLO). The Sigma single-particle potential is found weakly attractive, in contrast to earlier weakly repulsive results, reflecting new constraints from the recent J-PARC E40 data on $\Sigma^+p$ scattering. An estimate of the theoretical uncertainty of the single-particle potentials is provided.</description>

      <title>Neutron Dark Decay and Exotic Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the compact star XTE J1814-338, with a mass of $M=1.2_{-0.05}^{+0.05}\ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=7_{-0.4}^{+0.4} \ {\rm Km}$ alongside those of HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.20}\ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.4_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ {\rm Km}$, provide compelling evidence for the potential existence of exotic matter in neutron star cores. These observations offer important insights into the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. Recently, Fornal and Grinstein, in order to overcame the discrepancy between the neutron lifetime measured in beam and bottle experiments, proposed the existence of neutron dark decay. In the present work, an effort is made to connect the interpretation of the above exotic compact objects with the possible existence of dark particles, assumed to be products of neutron dark decay. Our hypothesis offers an advantage over comparable proposals, as the coexistence of dark matter and hadronic matter within neutron stars emerges from an intrinsic mechanism, thereby obviating the need to invoke external merger-related processes. It is still unclear to what extent the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme environment within neutron stars. Within this framework, we examined the case in which a mechanism suppressing the dark neutron decay becomes operative at densities few times above nuclear saturation density. We found that the proposed alternative explanation accommodates the simultaneous existence of neutron dark decay while consistently predicting both the two solar mass limit and the presence of compact objects with subsolar masses.</description>

      <title>Exterior complex scaling enables physics-informed neural networks for quantum scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving differential equations, yet their application to quantum scattering problems has been hindered by the oscillatory, non-decaying nature of scattering wave functions. In this work, I demonstrate that exterior complex scaling (ECS) transforms scattering boundary conditions into exponentially decaying waves suitable for neural network solutions, enabling PINNs to solve nuclear scattering problems for the first time. I develop a driven-equation formulation where the source term is confined to the real axis, avoiding the need to analytically continue nuclear potentials into the complex plane. The method is validated on nucleon-nucleus scattering (n+$^{40}$Ca at $E_{\text{lab}}=20$~MeV) with 21 partial waves, achieving phase shift accuracy of $\Delta\delta &lt; 0.1^\circ$ for most channels when compared to conventional solvers. I further demonstrate the approach on heavy-ion scattering ($^6$Li+$^{208}$Pb at 40~MeV) with 41 partial waves and strong Coulomb effects. This work establishes the foundation for extending PINNs to inverse problems where end-to-end differentiability enables direct fitting of optical potential parameters, coupled-channel reactions, and few-body scattering where traditional grid methods face exponential scaling.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Neutron-Skin Thicknesses and Implications for the Symmetry-Energy Slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-skin thicknesses provide a sensitive probe of the isovector sector of the nuclear equation of state and its density dependence, commonly characterized by the symmetry-energy slope parameter L. A wide variety of experimental and observational methods have been used to extract neutron skins, ranging from hadronic and electromagnetic probes of finite nuclei to inferences from neutron-star observations. Each approach carries distinct theoretical and systematic uncertainties, complicating global interpretations and obscuring genuine physical trends. In this work we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for the statistically consistent synthesis of heterogeneous neutron-skin constraints. The neutron-skin thickness is modeled as a smooth latent function of isospin asymmetry and nuclear size, while method-dependent bias parameters and intrinsic nuisance widths are introduced to account for unmodeled experimental and theoretical systematics. Focusing on the tin isotopes, we infer probabilistic neutron-skin trends from 100Sn to 140Sn, finding minimal uncertainties near stability and increasing uncertainties toward the proton-rich and neutron-rich extremes. We assess the consistency of nuclear energy-density functionals and obtain conditional constraints on the symmetry-energy parameters. The resulting posterior exhibits a pronounced compression of the symmetry-energy slope parameter L, reflecting the dominant sensitivity of neutron skins to sub-saturation symmetry pressure. We demonstrate that our hierarchical Bayesian framework provides robust and transparent constraints on the sub-saturation isovector sector of the nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <title>Emergent equilibrium-like yields from nonequilibrium cascade dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium cascades in which fragile bound or coherent structures are formed through intermediate states rather than by direct equilibration. Motivated by light-nuclei production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and by Bose--Einstein condensation in cosmological settings, we analyze such processes within the Schwinger--Keldysh real-time formalism. We show that commonly used rate equations can be understood as a controlled Markovian approximation obtained by integrating out intermediate reservoirs in an underlying multi-component nonequilibrium dynamics. When the finite lifetime of these reservoirs is retained, non-Markovian memory effects naturally appear, leading to delayed and history-dependent formation dynamics. The associated memory time provides a quantitative criterion for the validity of reduced, rate-based descriptions far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Disentangling baryon stopping and neutron skin effects in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the net baryon (B) and net electric charge (Q) stopping in heavy-ion collisions using the statistical model. Focusing first on isobar collisions $\rm{Ru}+\rm{Ru}$ and $\rm{Zr}+\rm{Zr}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$~GeV, we show that the excess baryon-stopping parameter $\gamma_B \equiv (N_B/N_Q)\,(Z/A)$ can be quantitatively extracted from forthcoming RHIC measurements of charge- and baryon-stopping ratios. We then generalize the approach to other collision systems at RHIC and LHC energies and introduce an oxygen-baseline observable, $r^{OX}$, whose central-to-peripheral ratio exhibits strong and systematic sensitivity to the neutron-skin thickness of the target nucleus $X$.</description>

      <title>Glauber predictions for oxygen and neon collisions at energies available at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Glauber model is a widely used framework for describing the initial conditions in high-energy nuclear collisions. TGlauberMC is a Monte Carlo implementation of this model that enables detailed, event-by-event calculations across various collision systems. In this work, I present an updated version of TGlauberMC (3.3), which incorporates recent theoretical developments and improved parameterizations, especially relevant for small collision systems. I focus on the oxygen-oxygen (OO), neon-neon (NeNe), and proton-oxygen (pO) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in July 2025, where precise modelling of nuclear geometry and fluctuations is essential. The updated version includes revised nuclear density profiles and an enhanced treatment of nucleon substructure. Geometrical cross sections for all relevant collision systems are calculated and initial-state observables are explored to provide predictions for particle production trends at $\sqrt{s_{\rm nn}}$=5.36 TeV. In particular, a prediction for the centrality dependence of mid-rapidity multiplicity in OO and NeNe collisions is obtained. The updated code is publicly available to support the heavy-ion community with a robust and flexible tool for studying strongly interacting matter in small and intermediate-sized nuclear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter related to the expansion of matter born in heavy-ion collisions was obtained for nucleons and pions. The calculations were carried out within the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport model. Au+Au collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.8$ GeV at $b = 2.5,\ 5.0,\ 7.5$, and $10.0$ fm were considered. A new method for determining the "microscopic" Hubble parameter from simulated data was used. The ballistic motion was obtained for the longitudinal direction after the separation of the nuclei. In earlier times, the evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter in this direction was more complicated. For transverse directions, an exponential low-time asymptotics of the Hubble parameter was observed. The obtained values of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter are about 40 orders of magnitude higher than the cosmological Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Band Theory for the Rod Phase in the Magnetized Inner Crust Matter: Entrainment, Spin-orbit Coupling, Spin-triplet Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inner crust of neutron stars hosts a rich variety of nuclear phenomena and provides a unique environment for exploring microscopic nuclear properties relevant to diverse astrophysical observations. Particularly magnetars, which possess extremely strong magnetic-fields, have attracted increasing attention in connection with nuclear spin dynamics and unconventional pairing correlations. This work is dedicated to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to describe the structures and properties of two-dimensional (rod-phase) matter in the neutron star inner crust, incorporating band-structure effects, neutron spin-triplet pairing, and strong magnetic-fields on an equal footing. The main results of this study can be summarized as follows. In the first place, the magnetic-fields of the order of $10^{16}\,$G are found to substantially enhance the neutron effective mass by a factor of approximately $1.5$, indicating a significant modification of entrainment properties in strongly magnetized crustal matter. In the second place, while the overall behavior of pairing phase transitions is qualitatively similar to that observed in one-dimensional systems studied previously, the present two-dimensional calculations reveal a nontrivial role of the spin-orbit interaction in inducing spin-polarization under magnetic fields. In the third place, concerning spin-triplet superfluidity, the rank-0 component is shown to emerge as a consequence of magnetic-field-induced spin-polarization, irrespective of the presence of spin-triplet pairing interactions, whereas the rank-2 component appears only when the corresponding interaction channel is included.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ factorisation in the target fragmentation region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the differential cross-section for single-inclusive jet production with transverse momentum $P_\perp$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small Bjorken $x_{\rm Bj}$, mediated by a virtual photon with virtuality $Q^2$. Unlike most studies at small $x$, which focus on particle production in the current fragmentation region, we investigate the kinematic regime where the jet is produced in the target fragmentation hemisphere of the Breit frame, and with $P_\perp \ll Q$. For a longitudinally polarised photon, we demonstrate that this cross-section is not power suppressed in $P_\perp/Q$ and we derive a factorised expression in terms of extended quark and gluon jet fracture functions. Our formula, valid at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ at small $x$, is akin to the Altarelli-Martinelli identity for the longitudinal DIS structure function. Numerical estimates show that the extended quark jet fracture function is the most sensitive to saturation effects in large nuclei.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

      <title>Origin of the nucleon gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent lattice QCD simulations and phenomenological models indicate that the nucleon's gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$ remains remarkably small at finite momentum transfer $t$. While $B_N(0) = 0$ is a known consequence of the equivalence principle, the physical origin of its suppression at finite $t$ has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ arises from a fundamental cancellation within the nucleon's wave functions. Using light-front holographic QCD, we show that $B_N(t)$ is governed by an antisymmetric factor in the longitudinal dynamics that leads to an exact vanishing in the symmetric limit and significant suppression for realistic nucleon structures. Our results suggest that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ is a signature of the nucleon's dominant S-wave character, providing a formal justification for its frequent omission in practical applications like near-threshold $J/\psi$ production.</description>
