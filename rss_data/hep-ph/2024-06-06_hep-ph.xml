      <title>{\mu}TRISTAN and LHC/Tevatron/FCC/SppC Based Antimuon-Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of {\mu^+}{e^-} and {\mu^+}{\mu^+} colliders, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar {\mu^+} ring tangential to LHC/Tevatron/FCC/SppC will give an opportunity to realize {\mu^+}p and {\mu^+}A collisions at multi-TeV scale center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration: L exceeds {10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}p colliders and {10^{30} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}A colliders. Certainly, proposed colliders will provide huge potential for both SM (especially QCD basics) and BSM physics searches.</description>

      <title>A new standard for the logarithmic accuracy of parton showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a major milestone in the construction of logarithmically accurate final-state parton showers, achieving next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy for the wide class of observables known as event shapes. The key to this advance lies in the identification of the relation between critical NNLL analytic resummation ingredients and their parton-shower counterparts. Our analytic discussion is supplemented with numerical tests of the logarithmic accuracy of three shower variants for more than a dozen distinct event-shape observables in $Z \to q \bar q$ and Higgs $\to gg$ decays. The NNLL terms are phenomenologically sizeable, as illustrated in comparisons to data.</description>

      <title>Higher-order corrections to phase-transition parameters in dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of phase transitions (PT) in quantum field theories at finite temperature is most accurately described within the framework of dimensional reduction. In this framework, thermodynamic quantities are computed within the 3-dimensional effective field theory (EFT) that results from integrating out the high-temperature Matsubara modes. However, strong-enough PTs, observable in gravitational wave (GW) detectors, occur often nearby the limit of validity of the EFT, where effective operators can no longer be neglected. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of these interactions on the determination of PT parameters. We find that they allow for strong PTs in a wider region of parameter space, and that both the peak frequency and the amplitude of the resulting GW power spectrum can change by more than one order of magnitude when they are included. As a byproduct of this work, we derive equations for computing the bounce solution in the presence of higher-derivative terms, consistently with the EFT power counting.</description>

      <title>Flavor Hierarchies From SU(2) Flavor and Quark-Lepton Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent attempt to explain flavor hierarchies [1], a gauged SU(2) flavor symmetry acting on left-handed fermions provides a ground to introduce three independent rank-one contributions to the Yukawa matrices: a renormalizable one for the third family, a mass-suppressed one for the second family, and an additional loop-suppressed factor for the first family. Here, we demonstrate how minimal quark-lepton unification \`a la Pati-Salam, relating down-quarks to charged leptons, can significantly improve this mechanism. We construct and thoroughly analyze a renormalizable model, performing a comprehensive one-loop matching calculation that reveals how all flavor hierarchies emerge from a single ratio of two scales. The first signatures may appear in the upcoming charged lepton flavor violation experiments.</description>

      <title>Random fluctuation walk in the boson star formation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the mechanism of formation of the scalar boson star (BS) having a hierarchy of self-similar "lumps" of dark matter (DM) built into the probability distribution function of allowed steps. It can ensure to study the dynamics of the BS formation through the "cross-over" between the free scalar DM and the compact condensate (CC) phase in one-dimensional model of the random fluctuation walk. The main inputs are the random fluctuating weight $\lambda &lt; 1$, the fundamental fluctuating length $\xi (\lambda)$ and the parameter $a &gt;1$ of the spatial separation between the DM "lumps" inside the BS. The solution to the functional equation for the characteristic probability to find the free scalar DM and the CC phase is obtained. The time evolution of the probability to form the DM "lump" (growth of the BS) is presented with the power-law cascades expression depending on $\lambda$ and $a$. The special cases for $\lambda$ in terms of the energy densities of the BS ($\rho_\star$) and the DM ($\rho_\odot$), as well as the Bose-Einstein correlation function for two scalar DM particles, are considered. The lower bounds on the critical temperature at the "cross-over" depending on $\rho_\odot$, $\rho_\star$, the average multiplicities of the scalar DM particles and the parameters related to the chaotically behaviour of the particles are obtained.</description>

      <title>Texture Zeros in modular Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Texture zeros play a crucial role in the phenomenological implementation of a particular model in the Beyond Standard Model framework. As such, in this work we study the possibility concerning the origin of texture zero in the neutrino mass matrix in the context of modular Left-Right Symmetric Model. Implementation of texture zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix brings forth the existence of allowed and disallowed classes of the texture zero classification. In the present work, we have studied Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay, Lepton flavor violation and Resonant Leptogenesis and tried to analyze if the simultaneous study of these three phenomenology are connected with a common parameter space within the model. We have determined the possible combinations of 1-0 and 2-0 textures in the context of resulting light neutrino mass matrix and illustrated the allowed classes for both textures corresponding to the realization of neutrinoless double beta decay, leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation. The study has been carried out for both normal and inverted hierarchy and the results have been illustrated in the present work.</description>

      <title>Exploring active-sterile neutrino mixings models in MES mechanism using modular $S_3$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimal extended seesaw mechanism with one sterile neutrino in a 3+1 framework using modular $S_3$ symmetry. The active-sterile neutrino models are classified based on the assignments of $S_3$ representations and modular weights of the left-handed lepton doublets, triplet right-handed neutrino, and sterile neutrino. No scalar flavons are considered, and the flavor symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the modulus $\tau$. For a particular set of representations of the Leptons and Higgs field, we obtain eleven (11) different models based on different modular weights of charged lepton $(k_L)$ and right-handed neutrino ($k_N$). Out of these, we consider two models, which are discriminated by carrying out the numerical analysis so that the parameter space in each model can fit the latest neutrino oscillation data at 3$\sigma$. The Planck cosmological bound on the upper limit of the sum of the active neutrino masses $\sum m_i &lt;0.12$eV is also considered. Finally, the best-fit parameters of the neutrino observables and model predictions are evaluated using the minimum $\chi^2$ analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning to see R-parity violating scalar top decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With this article we introduce recent, improved machine learning methods from computer vision to the problem of event classification in particle physics. Supersymmetric scalar top decays to top quarks and weak scale bino-like neutralinos, where the neutralinos decay via the $UDD$ operator to three quarks, are difficult to search for and therefore weakly constrained. The jet substructure of the boosted decay products can be used to differentiate signal from background events. We apply transformer-based computer vision models CoAtNet and MaxViT to images built from jet constituents and compare the classification performance to a more classical convolutional neural network (CNN). We find that results from computer vision translate well onto physics applications and both transformer-based models perform better than the CNN. By replacing the CNN with MaxViT we find an improvement of $S/\sqrt{B}$ by a factor of almost 2 for some neutralino masses. We show that combining this classifier with additional features results in a strong separation of background and signal. We also find that replacing a CNN with a MaxViT model in a simple mock analysis can push the 95% C.L. exclusion limit of stop masses by about $100$ GeV and $60$ GeV for neutralino masses of $100$ GeV and $500$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Frontier: White Dwarf-Based Constraints on Light Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vast expanse of our galaxy, white dwarfs (WDs) are natural sentinels, capturing the enigmatic dark matter (DM) particles that incessantly traverse their interiors. These celestial bodies provide a unique vantage point for probing interactions between DM particles and their constituents-nuclei or electrons-should such interactions exist. The captured DM particles may accumulate, undergo mutual annihilation, or be evaporated by the WD's own nuclei or electrons, thereby perturbing the standard cooling sequence predicted by stellar evolution theory. This letter reports pioneering constraints on DM-electron interactions derived from an in-depth analysis of four pulsating WDs. By leveraging the period variation rates of their pulsation modes, we delineate the following constraints: for a form factor $F(q) = 1$, in the DM mass range $20 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 80 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a cross-section limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-56} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$; for a form factor $F(q) = (\alpha m_{e})^{2}/q^{2}$, in a the DM mass range $20\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 70 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-52} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. These newly established constraints surpass current direct detection experiments by over fifteen orders of magnitude, forging a path into the uncharted territories of the DM parameter space. This work not only advances our understanding of light dark matter-electron interactions but also exemplifies the potential of WDs as important astrophysical laboratories for probing the elusive nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating decays $Z\rightarrow l^{\pm}_{i}l^{\mp}_{j}$ in the B-L Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violation (LFV) represents a clear new physics (NP) signal beyond the standard model (SM). In this paper, we study LFV decays $Z\rightarrow l^{\pm}_{i}l^{\mp}_{j}$ in the B-L Supersymmetric Standard Model(B-LSSM). We calculate these processes separately in the mass eigenstate basis and the electroweak interaction basis, and the latter adopt the mass insertion approximation (MIA) method. The MIA clearly shows the effect of parameters on the LFV decays $Z\rightarrow l^{\pm}_{i}l^{\mp}_{j}$ in the analytic level, which provides a new way for us to analyze the LFV processes. At the same time, the corresponding constraints from the LFV decays $l^{-}_{j} \rightarrow l^{-}_{i} \gamma$ and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ are considered to analyze the numerical results.</description>

      <title>The Amaterasu particle: constraining the superheavy dark matter origin of UHECRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amaterasu, the second most energetic ($244$ EeV) cosmic ray particle has been recently detected by the Telescope Array (TA) surface detector. The origin of the TA Amaterasu event is puzzling, as its arrival direction points back to a void in the local Universe, lacking conventional astrophysical ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic ray (CR) sources. Hence, we explore the possibility if this TA Amaterasu event could have originated from the decay of superheavy dark matter (SHDM) in the Milky Way. Such an origin also opens up multi-messenger detection channels in both UHE gamma-rays and UHE neutrinos. In this present work, using the TA Amaterasu event and the multi-messenger limits/sensitivities from various UHE telescopes, we place stringent constraints on the lifetime and mass of the SHDM. We find that the non-detection of the corresponding gamma-rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the TA is in severe tension with the SHDM parameter space required to explain the TA Amaterasu event. Additionally, we extend the multi-messenger analysis to the future UHE gamma-ray and UHE neutrino telescopes such as PAO upgrade, GRAND 200k and IceCube-Gen2. We find that the bounds from the future neutrino telescopes will be able to compete with the present UHECR bounds. However, compared to the existing UHE gamma-ray bounds, the future PAO upgrade and the GRAND 200k gamma-ray detectors will improve the bounds on SHDM lifetime by at least one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis via QCD preheating with nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral phase transition in QCD can be supercooled in the thermal history of the universe to be instantaneously out-of equilibrium, if QCD is coupled to a dark QCD sector exhibiting the dark chiral phase transition of the first order. In that case the QCD sigma meson field (as the chiral order parameter, or the light quark condensate) starts to roll in a nonadiabatic way down to the true QCD vacuum. Meanwhile a dynamic baryonic chemical potential can be generated solely within QCD, which is governed by the dynamic motion of the QCD sigma meson field, analogously to the spontaneous baryogenesis or the leptogenesis via the Higgs or axionlike relaxation scenario. When QCD is further allowed to communicate with a dark fermion with mass of order of 1 GeV and the baryon number violating coupling to neutron, the nonadiabatic QCD sigma motion along with the nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential can trigger the preheating and produce the baryon number asymmetry. We discuss this scenario in details to find that the QCD-induced dynamic baryon chemical potential plays a significant role for the QCD preheating and the baryogenesis, which yields the desired amount of the asymmetry today consistently with current astrophysical, cosmological, and terrestrial experimental constraints. Cosmological and phenomenological consequences characteristic to the present scenario are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Production of $ B \bar{B}$ bound state via $\Upsilon (4S)$ radiative decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent theoretical predictions about the existence of a $ B \bar{B}$ bound state (also denoted as $ X(10550) $), in this work we estimate the production of the $S$-wave $ B^+ B^-$ molecule via $\Upsilon (4S)$ radiative decays. In particular, we make use of effective Lagrangian approach and the compositeness condition to calculate the $ X(10550) $ production rate via $\Upsilon(4S)\rightarrow \gamma X(10550)$ decays employing triangle diagrams. Our results show that the partial decay width of this reaction is of the order of $0.5 - 192 \ \keV $ for a respective binding energy of $1 - 100 $ MeV, corresponding to a branching fraction of $ 10^{-5} - 10^{-3}$. These findings suggest that the existence of the $ X(10550) $ might be checked via the analysis of the mentioned decay in present and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Minimal U(1) two-Higgs-doublet models for quark and lepton flavour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the 2HDM, and assuming that neutrinos acquire masses via the Weinberg operator, we perform a systematic analysis to determine the minimal quark and lepton flavour patterns, compatible with masses, mixing and CP violation data, realisable by Abelian symmetries. We determine four minimal models for quarks, where the number of independent parameters matches the number of observables. For the lepton sector, three minimal predictive models are identified. Namely, we find scenarios with a preference for the upper/lower octant of the $\theta_{23}$ atmospheric mixing angle, that exhibit lower bounds on the lightest neutrino masses currently probed by cosmology and testable at future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, even for a normally-ordered neutrino masses. We investigate the phenomenology of each model taking into account all relevant theoretical, electroweak precision observables, scalar sector constraints, as well as stringent quark flavour processes such as $\overline{B} \rightarrow X_s \gamma$, $B_s \rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+$ and meson oscillations, and the charged lepton flavour-violating decays $e_\alpha^{-} \rightarrow e_\beta^{-} e_\gamma^{+} e_\delta^{-}$ and $e_\alpha \rightarrow e_\beta \gamma$. We show that, in some cases, Abelian flavour symmetries provide a natural framework to suppress flavour-changing neutral couplings and lead to scenarios featuring heavy neutral/charged scalar masses below the TeV scale within the reach of current experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal chiral contributions to generalized parton distributions of the proton at nonzero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop contributions to spin-averaged generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the proton from pseudoscalar mesons with intermediate octet and decuplet baryon states at nonzero skewness. Our framework is based on nonlocal covariant chiral effective theory, with ultraviolet divergences regularized by introducing a relativistic regulator derived consistently from the nonlocal Lagrangian. Using the splitting functions calculated from the nonlocal Lagrangian, we find the nonzero skewness GPDs from meson loops by convoluting with the phenomenological pion GPD and the generalized distribution amplitude, and verify that these satisfy the correct polynomiality properties. We also compute the lowest two moments of GPDs to quantify the meson loop effects on the Dirac, Pauli and gravitational form factors of the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the LuxQED approach to compute the polarized photon PDF (photon pPDF). This approach expresses the pPDF in terms of the structure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$. Different models for the structure functions are employed according to the parameter space region. The resulting pPDF is approximately of the order of $x$ times the unpolarized PDF. The relative uncertainty in the photon pPDF reaches up to $50\%$ for $x \sim 10^{-3}$, decreasing to approximately $10\%$ for higher values of $x$. The computation of the photon pPDF will be essential for improving the precision of polarized calculations and will have fundamental implications for studies at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Analysis of experimental data on neutron decay for the possibility of the existence of a right vector boson $W_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the assumption that sterile neutrinos are right-handed neutrinos, an analysis of the modern experimental situation in neutron decay for right-handed currents was carried out. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there are indications of the existence of a right-handed vector boson $W_R$ with a mass $M_{W_R}\approx 870_{-140}^{+260} \text{GeV}$ and a mixing angle with $W_L$: $\zeta=0.061_{-0.024}^{+0.017}$. This circumstance is the basis for discussing the possibility of expanding the Standard Model with an additional gauge vector boson $W_R$ and right-handed neutrinos.</description>

      <title>SIREN: An Open Source Neutrino Injection Toolkit</title>

Abstract: Modeling of rare neutrino processes often relies on either simple approximations or expensive detector simulations. The former is often not sufficient for interactions with complex morphologies, while the latter is too time-intensive for phenomenological studies. We present SIREN (Sampling and Injection for Rare EveNts), a new tool for neutrino phenomenology and experimental searches alike that enables accurate interaction and detector geometry modeling without the overhead of detailed detector response simulations. SIREN handles the injection of rare process final states and the associated weighting calculations with the speed needed for phenomenological investigations and the detail necessary for dedicated experimental searches. The extensible design of SIREN allows it to support a wide range of experimental designs and Beyond-Standard-Model neutrino interactions. Users need only specify the physical process, detector geometry, and initial neutrino flux under consideration before they can accurately simulate a model in their detector of choice. We demonstrate the capability of SIREN through two examples: (1) Standard Model $\nu_\mu$ deep inelastic scattering in IceCube, DUNE, and ATLAS; and (2) heavy neutral lepton interactions in MiniBooNE, MINER$\nu$A, CCM. A variety of detector geometry descriptions, interaction cross sections, and neutrino fluxes are also provided for users to get started with immediately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Veneziano amplitude of string theory is the unique solution to an analytically solvable bootstrap problem. Uniqueness follows from two assumptions: faster than power-law falloff in high-energy scattering and the existence of some infinite sequence in momentum transfer at which higher-spin exchanges cancel. The string amplitude$\unicode{x2013}$including the mass spectrum$\unicode{x2013}$is an output of this bootstrap. If the amplitude merely vanishes at high energies, the solution is a three-parameter family containing the Veneziano, Coon, and hypergeometric amplitudes, and more.</description>

      <title>Dark magnetohydrodynamics: Black hole accretion in superradiant dark photon clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes threaded by massive vector fields can be subject to a superradiant instability, growing a cloud of massive vector particles around it. In this work, we consider what happens if such a dark matter candidate field mimicking a dark photon interacts with an accretion flow onto the black hole. By including a kinetic mixing term with the standard model photon, we extend the commonly used equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics to a dark photon constituent. The coupling to the dark photon then appears as an effective dynamo term together with a dark Lorentz force acting on the accreting matter. We numerically study the interactions between the superradiant dark photon cloud and the inner accretion flow by solving the coupled system in full numerical relativity. By parameterically varying the mixing parameter between dark and standard model sector, we provide a first investigation of how the accretion flow could be modified. Depending on the coupling strength, our solutions exhibit increased wind launching, as well as oscillation modes in the disk.</description>

      <title>Strange Dwarfs: a review on the (in)stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs are the remnants of stars not massive enough to become supernovae. This review explores the concept of strange dwarfs, a unique class of white dwarfs which contain cores of strange quark matter. Strange dwarfs have different sizes, masses, and evolutionary paths with respect to white dwarfs. They might form through the accumulation of normal matter on strange quark stars or by capture of strangelets. The stability of strange dwarfs has been debated, with initial studies suggesting stability, while later analyses indicated potential instability. This review revisits these discussions, focusing on the critical role of boundary conditions between nuclear and quark matter in determining stability. It also offers insights into their formation, structure, and possible detection in the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use a modified 2-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to study hybrid stars with a hypothesis that the quark matter may not be strange [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 222001 (2018)]. To obtain hybrid equation of states, the Maxwell construction is used to describe the first-order confinement-deconfinement phase transition in hybrid stars. With recent measurements on neutron star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, the hybrid equation of states are constrained. The result suggests that pure nonstrange quark matter cores can exist in hybrid stars, possessing 0.014-0.026 solar mass, and the binary neutron stars in GW170817 may be hadron stars.</description>

      <title>Holographic drag force with translational symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate how the drag force is affected by translational symmetry breaking (TSB), we utilize a holographic model in which the background metric remains translational symmetric while a graviton mass or other fields in the theory break this symmetry. We calculate analytically the drag force, considering an asymptotic AdS$_5$ in which parameter $\alpha$ arises from TSB. This parameter can be intuitively understood as a measure of TSB strength and we anticipate that non-zero values of it will affect the drag force. In this asymptotic AdS$_5$ background, we will demonstrate that a decrease in $\alpha$ results in a reduction of the drag force. Moreover, we study the diffusion constant, which falls with increasing $\alpha$. It will eventually be shown that at lower values of $\alpha$ or $\mu$ (chemical potential), the transverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal one, and the speed of the heavy quark has minimal impact on the ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work a rotating SU(2) gluon system have been studied with the dyon ensemble in dilute limit. By solving the rotation-modified Yang-Mills equation we have obtained rotational corrections to the so-called dyon solutions with arbitrary centers to $\mathcal{O}(\omega^2)$ order and the corresponding semi-classical potential. The radial position dependent deconfinement temperature have been obtained by minimizing the semi-classical potential in both real and imaginary angular velocity cases. Although without the $\omega$-dependent coupling constant the critical temperature behaves different from the lattice simulation at each radial position as the rotation goes faster, its radial dependence is qualitatively the same as the lattice. That is in the real velocity case the outer layer will deconfine more difficult while the reverse is true in the imaginary velocity case.</description>

Abstract: In the wake of measurements on $B_c^+ \to J/\psi K^+$, $B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-\pi^+$, and $B_c^+ \to J/\psi K^+ K^-\pi^+$ at Large Hadron Collider experiments, we propose to study the decays $B_c^+ \to J/\psi M^+$ comprehensively, with $M$ being the light charged pseudoscalar ($P$), vector ($V$), scalar ($S$), axial-vector ($A$), and tensor ($T$) mesons, within the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) formalism at leading order in the Standard Model. The theoretical predictions for experimental observables such as branching fractions, relative ratios, and longitudinal polarization fractions in the iPQCD formalism await near future examinations relying on the upgraded Large Hadron Collider, even the forthcoming Circular Electron-Positron Collider. We emphasize that the investigations on the factorizable-emission-suppressed or -forbidden decays like $B_c^+ \to J/\psi S^+$, $B_c^+ \to J/\psi A^+_{1^1\!P_1}$, and $B_c^+ \to J/\psi T^+$, should go definitely beyond naive factorization to explore the rich dynamics, which could, in turn, further help understand the QCD nature of $B_c$ meson, as well as that of related hadrons. The future confirmations on those predictions about the relative ratios between the branching fractions of $B_c^+ \to J/\psi b_1(1235)^+ (a_0(980)^+, a_0(1450)^+, a_2(1320)^+)$ and $B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+$ could further examine the reliability of this iPQCD formalism. Because of containing only tree-level $\bar b \to \bar c$ transitions, the {\it CP} asymmetries in the $B_c^+ \to J/\psi M^+$ decays exhibit naturally zero.</description>

      <title>Deep Exclusive Meson Production as a probe to the puzzle of $\Lambda$ hyperon polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1970s, an unexpected transverse $\Lambda$ polarization in unpolarized proton-Beryllium collisions was discovered, which initiated extensive studies on spin phenomena in high-energy physics. Over the past five decades, similar transverse $\Lambda$ polarization has been observed across various collision systems, including lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering, hadron-hadron collisions, and electron-positron collisions. Despite numerous promising theoretical models, the fundamental mechanism underlying this polarization phenomenon remains inconclusive to this day. However, in both longitudinally and transversely polarized lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions, it is found that the $\Lambda$ hyperon is not polarized with respect to the initial parton spin direction. How the $\Lambda$ hyperon acquires its spin has become one of the most crucial questions to address in order to resolve this puzzle. In this paper, I propose to use an exclusive process that can be measured at the Electron-Ion Collider, the Deep Exclusive Meson Production, to explicitly test the mechanism of $\Lambda$ polarization. The outcomes of this experimental measurement are anticipated to unveil the dominant mechanism by which $\Lambda$ obtains its spin, eliminating many of the ambiguities that have been encountered in previous studies. Finally, experimental challenges and requirements will be discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent evidence for $B^+\to K^+\bar{\nu} \nu$ decays at Belle II, we point out that fully invisible $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson decays are strongly constrained by LEP. A reinterpretation of an old inclusive ALEPH search for $b$-hadron decays with large missing energy allows us to place the limits $\mathrm{Br}(B_d \rightarrow \mathrm{invisible}) &lt; 1.4\times10^{-4}$ and $\mathrm{Br}(B_s \rightarrow \mathrm{invisible}) &lt; 5.6\times10^{-4}$, both at $90\%$ CL. The $B_d$ limit is only a factor of 6 looser than the world-leading one provided by the BaBar collaboration, while the $B_s$ one is the first limit in the literature on this decay mode. These results are relevant in the context of new light states coupled to quarks and exemplify the power of a future Tera-$Z$ factory at FCC-ee to look for $B$ meson decays containing missing energy.</description>

      <title>Novel Cross Section Ratios as Possible Signals of Saturation in UPCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new cross section ratios in ultra-peripheral A$+$A and $p+$A collisions (UPCs) as a potential experimental signal of saturation physics. We consider the ratio $R_1$ of elastic vector meson photoproduction cross section to the inclusive hadron or jet photoproduction cross section. The ratio can be measured in the $\gamma +$A and $\gamma + p$ collisions taking place in the UPCs. We label the ratios $R_1 ({\rm A})$ and $R_1 (p)$, respectively. Constructing the double ratio $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A}) = R_1 ({\rm A})/R_1 (p)$, and performing a small-$x$ calculation both in the quasi-classical approximation and by including small-$x$ evolution, we observe that $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A})$ exhibits a markedly different dependence on the nuclear atomic number inside and outside the saturation region. This result indicates that $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A})$ and $R_1 ({\rm A})$ measurements in UPCs may help in the experimental searches for the evidence of saturation physics.</description>

Abstract: The Shower Deconstruction methodology is pivotal in distinguishing signal and background jets, leveraging the detailed information from perturbative parton showers. Rooted in the Neyman-Pearson lemma, this method is theoretically designed to differentiate between signal and background processes optimally in high-energy physics experiments. A key challenge, however, arises from the combinatorial growth associated with increasing jet constituents, which hampers its computational feasibility. We address this by demonstrating that the likelihood derived from comparing the most probable signal and background shower histories is equally effective for discrimination as the conventional approach of summing over all potential histories in top quark versus Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) scenarios. We propose a novel approach by conceptualising the identification of the most probable shower history as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Utilising a sophisticated modular point-transformer architecture, our method efficiently learns the optimal policy for this task. The developed neural agent excels in constructing the most likely shower history and demonstrates robust generalisation capabilities on unencountered test data. Remarkably, our approach mitigates the complexity inherent in the inference process, achieving a linear scaling relationship with the number of jet constituents. This offers a computationally viable and theoretically sound method for signal-background differentiation, paving the way for more effective data analysis in particle physics.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of the parameter space of axion and axion-like particle dark matter is a major aim of the future program of astroparticle physics investigations. In this context, we present a possible strategy that focuses on detecting radio emissions arising from the conversion of dark matter axions in the Sun's magnetic field, including conversion in sunspots. We demonstrate that near-future low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the SKA Low, may access regions of unexplored parameter space for masses $m_a\lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\chi_{cJ}\to VV$ decays using the QCD effective field theory approach. The helicity suppressed decay amplitudes are also considered. The colour-singlet contributions of these amplitudes suffer from the endpoint singularities, it is shown that they can be absorbed into renormalisation of the nonfactorisable colour-octet matrix element. The latter can be associated with the colour-octet component of the charmonium wave function. The heavy quark spin symmetry makes it possible to establish the relationships between colour-octet matrix elements for different states $\chi_{cJ}$ up to higher order corrections in small velocity $v$. This allows us to estimate the polarisation parameters for $\chi_{c2}\to VV$ using data for $\chi_{c0,1}\to VV$. This analysis is carried out for the available data on the $\chi_{cJ}\to \phi\phi$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-loop contributions to semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering in the target fragmentation region for a polarized lepton beam and nucleon target. Complete one-loop results at leading twist are derived, with a particular focus on the gluonic channel. It shows that four structure functions are generated uniquely by the gluon fracture functions starting at one-loop. Additionally, we obtain two structure functions associated with the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon, and they are contributed by both gluon and quark channels. By combining existing twist-3 results, all eighteen structure functions for the studied process are predicted in terms of fracture functions convoluted with perturbative coefficient functions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study masses and decays of triply-heavy pentaquarks $QQQn\bar{n}(Q=b,c)$ in the unified MIT bag model. We construct the color-spin wave functions of the triply-heavy pentaquarks we address and use numerical variational method to compute all ground-state masses of these system. By excluding the scattering states in these configurations, we compute the decay width ratios of each decay channels relative to the maximum width for the compact pentaquark states, obtaining main decay modes of the triply-heavy pentaquark systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem in energy-dependent potentials using semiclassical methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave equations with energy-dependent potentials appear in many areas of physics, ranging from nuclear physics to black hole perturbation theory. In this work, we use the semi-classical WKB method to first revisit the computation of bound states of potential wells and reflection/transmission coefficients in terms of the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule and the Gamow formula. We then discuss the inverse problem, in which the latter observables are used as a starting point to reconstruct the properties of the potentials. By extending known inversion techniques to energy-dependent potentials, we demonstrate that so-called width-equivalent or WKB-equivalent potentials are not isospectral anymore. Instead, we explicitly demonstrate that constructing quasi-isospectral potentials with the inverse techniques is still possible. Those reconstructed, energy-independent potentials share key properties with the width-equivalent potentials. We report that including energy-dependent terms allows for a rich phenomenology, particularly for the energy-independent equivalent potentials.</description>

      <title>A randomly generated Majorana neutrino mass matrix using Adaptive Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A randomly generated complex symmetric matrix using Adaptive Monte Carlo method, is taken as a general form of Majorana neutrino mass matrix, which is diagonalized by the use of eigenvectors. We extract all the neutrino oscillation parameters i.e. two mass-squared differences ($\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$ ), three mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and three phases i.e. one Dirac CP violating phase ($\delta_{CP}$) and two Majorana phases ($\alpha$ and $\beta$). The charge-parity (CP) violating phases are extracted from the mixing matrix constructed with the eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix formed by the complex symmetric matrix. All the neutrino oscillation parameters within 3$\sigma$ bound are allowed in both normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) consistent with the latest Planck cosmological upper bound, $\sum\vert m_i\vert&lt;0.12$ eV. This latest cosmological upper bound is allowed only in three cases of zero texture for $m_{11}=0$; $m_{11},m_{12}=0$ and $m_{11},m_{13}=0$ in normal hierarchy whereas none of zero texture is allowed in inverted hierarchy. We also study effective neutrino masses $m_{\beta}$ in tritium beta decay and $m_{\beta\beta}$ in neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Understanding the nature of the $\Delta(1600)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a coupled-channel analysis of the $ J^P = 3/2^+ \Delta $-baryon spectrum, based in the framework of Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We construct a Hamiltonian which mixes quark model-like single-particle states and two-particle meson-baryon channels, and constrain this via experimentally measured $ \pi N \to \pi N $ scattering observables. In the same vein as L\"{u}scher's approach, we then connect this infinite-volume inspired Hamiltonian with finite-volume lattice QCD results. Drawing on lattice correlation-matrix eigenvectors identifying the $ 1s $ and $ 2s $ states in the finite-volume $ \Delta(3/2^+) $ spectrum, and utilising the HEFT eigenvectors describing the composition of the energy eigenstates, we resolve the structure of these states and their relation to the $ \Delta(1600) $ resonance. We find the dominant contributions to this resonance come from strong rescattering in the $ \pi N $ and $ \pi \Delta $ channels. This contrasts the long-held view of a dominant quark model-like core for the $ \Delta(1600) $. Further discussion of other contemporary lattice results for the $ \Delta $ spectrum and $ \pi N $ scattering states is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If millicharged particles (MCPs) exist they can be created in the atmosphere when high energy cosmic rays collide with nuclei and could subsequently be detected at neutrino experiments. We extend previous work, which considered MCPs from decays of light mesons and proton bremsstrahlung, by including production from $\Upsilon$ meson decays and the Drell-Yan process. MCPs with masses below a GeV primarily arise from proton bremsstrahlung, while heavier MCPs predominantly originate from heavy meson decays and Drell-Yan. We analyse the resulting single scatter and multiple scatter signals at SuperK and JUNO. Searches for low energy coincident signals at JUNO will be sensitive to MCPs with milli-charges up to an order of magnitude beyond current constraints for MCP masses between 2 GeV and 10 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark photons that kinetically mix with the Standard Model photon give rise to new spectral anisotropies (patchy dark screening) in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) due to conversion of photons to dark photons within large-scale structure. We utilize predictions for this patchy dark screening signal to provide the tightest constraints to date on the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter ($\varepsilon \lesssim 4\times 10^{-8}$ (95% confidence level)) over the mass range $10^{-13} \,\, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_{{A^\prime}} \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, almost an order of magnitude stronger than previous limits, by applying state-of-the-art component separation techniques to the cross-correlation of $\textit{Planck}$ CMB and $\textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey data.</description>

Abstract: Existing Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) operate by detecting either the electrons or holes created in an ionization event. We propose a new type of imager, the Dual-Sided CCD, which collects and measures both charge carriers on opposite sides of the device via a novel dual-buried channel architecture. We show that this dual detection strategy provides exceptional dark-count rejection and enhanced timing capabilities. These advancements have wide-ranging implications for dark-matter searches, near-IR/optical spectroscopy, and time-domain X-ray astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cores of massive neutron stars offer a unique environment for the nuclear matter at intermediate density in the universe. The global characteristics of a neutron star, as well as the gravitational waves emitted from the mergers of two neutron stars, offer valuable insights into dense nuclear matter. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the potential hadron-quark transition on the properties of neutron stars and the signals of the gravitational waves stemming from the merger of binary neutron stars, including waveforms, frequency evolutions as well as the spectrum curves, utilizing the equations of state constructed from the Maxwell ansatz, Gibbs ansatz and, the crossover scenario. We explicitly construct the equations of state in such a way that they converge at low and high densities therefore the differences are only from the scenarios of the transitions and the locations -- or the parameters in the equation of state. Using such constructed equations of state, we simulate the signals of the GW and analyze their differences due to locations of the transition, the scenarios of the transition, and the masses of the component stars. By combining our findings with the expected detection of gravitational waves around $(2-4)$ kHz from binary neutron star mergers and their associated electromagnetic signals, we expect to uncover some key characteristics of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter interpretation of Crater II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The satellite galaxy Crater II of the Milky Way is extremely cold and exceptionally diffuse. These unusual properties are challenging to understand in the standard model of cold dark matter. We investigate the formation of Crater II in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), where dark matter particles can scatter and thermalize. We conduct a series of controlled N-body simulations to model the tidal evolution of Crater II, varying the self-interacting cross section, orbit parameters, and initial stellar distribution. Dark matter self-interactions lead to halo core formation and the distribution of stars expands accordingly. A cored SIDM halo also boosts tidal mass loss, allowing for a high orbit. Our simulations show that SIDM halos with a $1~{\rm kpc}$ core can simultaneously explain the low stellar velocity dispersion and the large half-light radius of Crater II, remaining robust to the initial distribution of stars. For the orbit motivated by the measurements from Gaia Early Data Release 3, the favored self-interacting cross section is approximately $60~{\rm cm^2/g}$ on the mass scale of Crater II.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram's complexities, including quark deconfinement transitions, liquid-gas phase changes, and critical points, using the chiral mean-field (CMF) model that is able to capture all these features. We introduce a vector meson renormalization within the CMF framework, enabling precise adjustments of meson masses and coupling strengths related to vector meson interactions. Performing a new fit to the deconfinement potential, we are able to replicate recent lattice QCD results, low energy nuclear physics properties, neutron star observational data, and key phase diagram features as per modern constraints. This approach enhances our understanding of vector mesons' roles in mediating nuclear interactions and their impact on the equation of state, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the QCD phase diagram and its implications for nuclear and astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes and Entanglement Islands in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Karch-Randall braneworld provides a natural set-up to study the Hawking radiation from a black hole using holographic tools. Such a black hole lives on a brane and is highly quantum yet has a holographic dual as a higher dimensional classical theory that lives in the ambient space. Moreover, such a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath which is absorbing its Hawking radiation. This allows us to compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation by studying the bath using the quantum extremal surface prescription. The quantum extremal surface geometrizes into a Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the ambient space. The topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in time from connecting different portions of the bath to the one connecting the bath and the brane gives the Page curve of the Hawking radiation that is consistent with unitarity. Nevertheless, there doesn't exit a derivation of the quantum extremal surface prescription and its geometrization in the Karch-Randall braneworld. In this paper, we fill this gap. We mainly focus on the case that the ambient space is (2+1)-dimensional for which explicit computations can be done in each description of the set-up. We show that the topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponds to the formation of the replica wormhole on the Karch-Randall brane as the dominate contribution to the replica path integral. For higher dimensional situations, we show that the geometry of the brane satisfies Einstein's equation coupled with conformal matter. We comment on possible implications to the general rule of gravitational path integral from this equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>
