      <title>Study of light $\phi$-mesic nuclei with HAL QCD $\phi N$ interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possible existence of light $\phi$-mesic nuclei using HAL QCD $\phi N$ interactions for the $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^4S_{3/2}$ channels. Particularly, using the Faddeev formalism in configuration space, the $\phi NN$ system, and $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He nuclei within the framework of the three-body cluster model, are investigated. The $\phi\alpha$ effective potential, obtained through a folding procedure, involves the HAL QCD $\phi N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel which does not lead to a bound state of the $\phi N$ pair while the $\phi N$ $^2S_{1/2}$ channel yields the bound state as the $^3_\phi$H nucleus. The $^4S_{3/2}$ potential ensures that the folding procedure is appropriate because there are no open channels like $\phi+N$ and $\phi +2N $ near or below the $\phi+ 4N$ threshold, and it utilizes different matter distributions of $^4$He proposed in the literature. The folding potential is approximated by the Woods-Saxon formula. The mirror systems $\phi$+$\alpha$+$\alpha$ and $\phi$+$\phi$+$\alpha$ have energy ranges from 1-11 MeV and 3-10~MeV, respectively. The predicted binding energies represent the minimal values for the hypothetical $\phi$ mesic nuclei $^{5}_{\phi}$He, $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He. The phenomenological $\alpha\alpha$ and $\phi\phi$ potentials are adopted from the literature.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic moments in the Sn-Gd region determined within the nuclear DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the nuclear DFT framework, employing the Skyrme UNEDF1 functional and incorporating pairing correlations, we determined the spectroscopic electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of the $\nu11/2^{-}$ and $\pi7/2^{+}$ configurations in heavy, deformed, open-shell odd nuclei with $50\leq Z \leq 64$. The notions of self-consistent shape and spin polarisations due to odd nucleons, which are responsible for generating total electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments, were transformed into detailed computational procedures. The alignment of intrinsic angular momentum along the axis of axial symmetry, necessitating signature and time-reversal symmetry breaking, followed by the restoration of rotational symmetry, proved to be essential components of the method. In contrast, the restoration of particle number symmetry yields modifications of only about 1%. With the isovector spin-spin terms of the functional previously adjusted in near doubly magic nuclei across the mass chart, the calculations were parameter-free. Effective charges and $g$-factors were not employed. A reasonably good agreement was achieved between the calculated and measured electric quadrupole moments. A similarly fair description of the magnetic dipole moments was obtained for the intruder configurations $\nu11/2^{-}$ alongside a poor description of those for $\pi7/2^{+}$.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay in the interacting boson model based on the nuclear energy density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations of neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) are carried out within the interacting boson model (IBM) that is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF) theory. The Hamiltonian of the IBM that gives rise to the energies and wave functions of the ground and excited states of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay emitter isotopes and corresponding final nuclei is determined by mapping the self-consistent mean-field deformation energy surface obtained with a given EDF onto the corresponding bosonic energy surface. The transition operators are formulated using the generalized seniority scheme, and the pair structure constants are determined by the inputs provided by the self-consistent calculations. The predicted values of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay NMEs with the nonrelativistic and relativistic EDFs are compared to those resulting from different many-body methods. Sensitivities of the predicted NMEs to the model parameters and assumptions, including those arising from the choice of the effective interactions, are discussed.</description>

      <title>The role of spin-isospin symmetries in nuclear beta-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost a century ago, Wigner SU(4) symmetry was introduced to explain the properties and beta-decays of atomic nuclei. Despite recent revived interest, its impact on nuclear structures, transitions, and reactions has not been fully explored. In this work we show that even in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking terms in the nuclear force, as much as 90% of the spin-isospin structure of light nuclei is captured by a single SU(4) irreducible representation. We also dissect one- and two-body axial current operators derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and prove that they are largely block diagonal in the SU(4) representation, suppressing weak transitions between different representations. Since SU(4) symmetry is emergent in $\chi$EFT, the corresponding matrix elements do not follow the EFT power counting.</description>

      <title>Acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants, long-range correlations, and the antiproton puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze joint factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and point out that they obey the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p\rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$ as a function of acceptance when only long-range correlations are present in the system, such as global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations. This hypothesis can be directly tested experimentally without the need for corrections for volume fluctuations. We show that if correlations among protons and antiprotons are driven by global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations only, the equality $\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2 = \hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2$ holds for large systems created in central collisions. We point out that the experimental data of the STAR Collaboration from phase I of RHIC beam energy scan are approximately consistent with the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p \rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$, but the normalized antiproton correlations are stronger than that of protons, $-\hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2 &gt; -\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2$, indicating that global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations alone cannot explain the data. We also discuss high-order factorial cumulants which can be measured with sufficient precision within phase II of RHIC-BES.</description>

      <title>Suppression of elliptic anisotropy inside jets: A new perspective for jet quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle azimuthal anisotropies inside jets, defined within the momentum plane perpendicular to the jet axis, carry the information of the QCD cascade process for jet formation. In this work, we propose to measure the medium-induced modifications of the elliptic anisotropy inside jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to provide novel insight into the jet quenching phenomenon. By simulating the jet propagation in the hot and dense nuclear medium with a Linear Boltzmann Transport model, we observe a de-correlation in the two-particle azimuthal angular distribution for inclusive jet production in AA collisions relative to that in pp collisions, which results in significant suppression of the in-jet elliptic anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. This phenomenon arises from the stochastic and strong interactions with the thermal QGP medium undergone by the jet particles. Furthermore, the nuclear modifications of the in-jet $v_2$ are found to be sensitive to the medium properties in the model study, which provide a potential probe for the jet tomography of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>NuPECC Long Range Plan 2024 for European Nuclear Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee ( NuPECC, http://nupecc.org/ ) hosted by the European Science Foundation represents today a large nuclear physics community from 23 countries, 3 ESFRI (European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures) nuclear physics infrastructures and ECT* (European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas), as well as from 4 associated members and 10 observers.
  As stated in the NuPECC Terms of Reference one of the major objectives of the Committee is: "on a regular basis, the Committee shall organise a consultation of the community leading to the definition and publication of a Long Range Plan (LRP) of European nuclear physics". To this end, NuPECC has in the past produced five LRPs: in November 1991, December 1997, April 2004, December 2010, and November 2017.
  The LRP, being the unique document covering the whole nuclear physics landscape in Europe, identifies opportunities and priorities for nuclear science in Europe and provides national funding agencies, ESFRI, and the European Commission with a framework for coordinated advances in nuclear science. It serves also as a reference document for the strategic plans for nuclear physics in the European countries.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and finite-size effects in integrable virial statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze thermodynamic models for fluid systems in equilibrium based on a virial expansion of the internal energy in terms of the volume density. We prove that the models, formulated for finite-size systems with $N$ particles, are exactly solvable to any expansion order, as expectation values of physical observables (e.g., volume density) are determined from solutions to nonlinear C-integrable PDEs of hydrodynamic type. In the limit $N\to\infty$, phase transitions emerge as classical shock waves in the space of thermodynamic variables. Near critical points, we argue that the volume density exhibits a scaling behavior consistent with the Universality Conjecture in viscous transport PDEs. As an application, we employ our framework to nuclear matter and construct a global QCD phase diagram revealing critical points for the nuclear liquid-gas and hadron gas-QGP transitions. We demonstrate how finite-size effects smear critical signatures, indicating the importance of thoughtful considerations in the search for the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Constraint Phase Space Formulations for Finite-State Quantum Systems: The Relation between Commutator Variables and Complex Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently developed the \textit{constraint} coordinate-momentum \textit{phase space} (CPS) formulation for finite-state quantum systems. It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. A} \textbf{2021}, 125, 6845-6863], each {connected} component of the generalized CPS is the \textit{complex Stiefel manifold} labeled by the eigenvalue set of the mapping kernel. Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{2016}, 145, 204105; \textbf{2017}, 146, 024110; \textbf{2019}, 151, 024105] lead to a complex Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{U}(F)/\mathrm{U}(F-2)$. It is expected that the generalized CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadiabatic transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions.</description>

Abstract: We compute the differential cross section for inclusive $\mathrm{D}^0$ production in ultraperipheral collisions within the Color Glass Condensate framework. Our predictions are found to be in relatively good agreement with the CMS data at small transverse momentum, which is the region of validity of our approach. Furthermore, we quantify saturation effects by a nuclear modification ratio $R_{pA}$ for $\mathrm{D}^0$ photoproduction and examine both analytically and numerically the collinear factorization limit of the $\mathrm{D}^0$ differential photoproduction cross section.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the sea: universality of the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we demonstrate that back-to-back dijet correlations in dilute-dense collisions involving a small-$x$ quark from the nuclear target can be factorised in terms of universal transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) for the sea quarks. Two building blocks are needed to construct all these TMDs at the operator level: the sea quark TMD operator which appears in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) or in the Drell-Yan process and the elastic $S$-matrix for a quark-antiquark dipole. Compared to SIDIS, the saturation effects are stronger for dijet production in forward proton-nucleus collisions, due to additional scattering in the initial and final state, effectively resulting in a larger value for the nuclear saturation momentum.</description>

      <title>Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics and other applications: a comprehensive programme for the next decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray physics in the GeV-to-TeV energy range has entered a precision era thanks to recent data from space-based experiments. However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework allowing to make an explicit connection between the phenomenology of QCD, namely the properties of the gluon correlator and Wilson loops, and a particular relativistic model for the description of nuclear matter and neutron stars, the chiral confining model. Starting with the Field Correlator Method, which incorporates explicitly and simultaneously confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, we describe how to obtain the response of the composite nucleon to the nuclear scalar field, the relative role of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the in-medium nucleon mass evolution, generating the three-body forces needed for the saturation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Effects of symmetry energy on the properties of hadron-quark mixed phase in hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the nuclear symmetry energy slope affects the properties of hadron-quark pasta phases and their sizes in massive hybrid stars ($&gt; 2 M_{\odot}$). We utilize the relativistic mean-field model with a density-dependent isovector coupling constant fitted by varying values of the symmetry energy slope $L$ to describe the hadronic matter, while the quark matter is described by a modified MIT bag model with vector interactions. We construct the hadron-quark phase transition using the energy minimization (EM) method and compare with the Gibbs construction (GC) in the hybrid star. We find that the massive hybrid stars generally tend to have a hadron-quark pasta phase core rather than a pure quark core for most values of $L$, except in some special cases where they have a small pure quark core. Furthermore, we show that the mass and size of the pasta phase core are strongly influenced by the symmetry energy. The radius associated with the onset of pasta phases is also influenced by the symmetry energy. Additionally, we also evaluate the effects of the surface tension $\sigma$, the bag constant $B$, and the vector interaction $G_{V}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>

      <title>Qutrit and Qubit Circuits for Three-Flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the peak of the sound velocity for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a system composed of strongly interacting matter with an isospin imbalance, using as an effective description of QCD the two-flavor Linear Sigma Model with quarks. From the one-loop effective potential, including the two light quarks, pions and sigma contributions, and enforcing the restrictions imposed by chiral symmetry, we show that the development of an isospin condensate comes together with the emergence of a Goldstone mode that provides a constraint for the chiral and isospin condensates as a result of a non-trivial mixing between the charged pions and the sigma. We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the peak of the sound velocity to the proper treatment of the Goldstone mode and to the non-trivial mixing of the charged pions and sigma in the isospin condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Lattice gradient flows (de-)stabilizing topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological charge under gradient flow taking the admissibility condition into account. For the $SU(2)$ Wilson gauge theory with $\beta=2.45$ and $L^4=12^4$, we numerically show that the gradient flows with the Iwasaki and DBW2 gauge actions stabilize the topological sectors significantly, and they have qualitatively different behaviors compared with the Wilson and tree-level Symanzik flows. By considering the classical continuum limit of the flow actions, we discuss that the coefficient of dimension-$6$ operators has to be positive for stabilizing the one-instanton configuration, and the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions satisfy this criterion while the Wilson and Symanzik actions do not. Moreover, we observe that the DBW2 flow stabilizes the topological sectors at the very early stage of the flow ($\hat{t}\approx 0.5$--$1$), suggesting that a further systematic investigation of the DBW2 flow is warranted to confirm its computational efficiency in determining the gauge topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the first measurements of the same ion species in OO collisons at RHIC and LHC, we propose an observable to distinguish whether collective behavior builds up through a hydrodynamic expansion of a strongly interacting QGP or few final state re-scatterings. Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on anisotropic flow. We validate its ability to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical catalysis constrained by LQCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidences of vortical effects have been recently found by experiments in heavy ion collisions, instigating new insights into the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Considering the effect of rotations, lattice QCD data shows that the temperatures for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration should increase with real angular velocity, and the dominant effects are related to gluonic degrees of freedom. These findings could be essential for quark models in rotating systems that lack gluonic interactions, which predicts the decreasing of the chiral temperature transition with the angular velocity. To address this issue properly, in this work we apply the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to explore the phase diagram in a rotating rigid cylinder with constant angular velocity in the mean field approximation. To circumvent the absence of gluons, we propose the application of an effective coupling dependent of the angular velocity, fitted to match the pseudocritical temperature of chiral phase transition in the model through lattice QCD data. Our results indicate that the running coupling induces the enhancement of the chiral condensate as a function of angular velocity, strengthening the breaking of chiral symmetry, an effect previously dubbed as chiral vortical catalysis. For the chiral susceptibility we observe stronger fluctuations around the transition temperature when we consider the running coupling. The phase diagram is affected by these findings shifting the critical end point (CEP) to higher temperatures and chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Neutrino energy and momentum emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>
