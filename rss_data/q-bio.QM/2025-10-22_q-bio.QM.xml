      <title>CBINNS: Cancer Biology-Informed Neural Network for Unknown Parameter Estimation and Missing Physics Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of tumor-immune interactions within a complex tumor microenvironment are typically modeled using a system of ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations. These models introduce some unknown parameters that need to be estimated accurately and efficiently from the limited and noisy experimental data. Moreover, due to the intricate biological complexity and limitations in experimental measurements, tumor-immune dynamics are not fully understood, and therefore, only partial knowledge of the underlying physics may be available, resulting in unknown or missing terms within the system of equations. In this study, we develop a cancer biology-informed neural network model(CBINN) to infer the unknown parameters in the system of equations as well as to discover the missing physics from sparse and noisy measurements. We test the performance of the CBINN model on three distinct nonlinear compartmental tumor-immune models and evaluate its robustness across multiple synthetic noise levels. By harnessing these highly nonlinear dynamics, our CBINN framework effectively estimates the unknown model parameters and uncovers the underlying physical laws or mathematical structures that govern these biological systems, even from scattered and noisy measurements. The models chosen here represent the dynamic patterns commonly observed in compartmental models of tumor-immune interactions, thereby validating the generalizability and efficacy of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Protein generation with embedding learning for motif diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in protein design is the trade-off between generating structural diversity while preserving motif biological function. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as partial diffusion in RFdiffusion, often fail to resolve this trade-off: small perturbations yield motifs nearly identical to the native structure, whereas larger perturbations violate the geometric constraints necessary for biological function. We introduce Protein Generation with Embedding Learning (PGEL), a general framework that learns high-dimensional embeddings encoding sequence and structural features of a target motif in the representation space of a diffusion model's frozen denoiser, and then enhances motif diversity by introducing controlled perturbations in the embedding space. PGEL is thus able to loosen geometric constraints while satisfying typical design metrics, leading to more diverse yet viable structures. We demonstrate PGEL on three representative cases: a monomer, a protein-protein interface, and a cancer-related transcription factor complex. In all cases, PGEL achieves greater structural diversity, better designability, and improved self-consistency, as compared to partial diffusion. Our results establish PGEL as a general strategy for embedding-driven protein generation allowing for systematic, viable diversification of functional motifs.</description>

      <title>Triangle Multiplication Is All You Need For Biomolecular Structure Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer.</description>

      <title>Enhancing mortality prediction in cardiac arrest ICU patients through meta-modeling of structured clinical data from MIMIC-IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information, specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918, compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%. The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.</description>

      <title>Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>HeFS: Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection via Pareto-Optimized Genetic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard. Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at https://healthinformaticslab.org/supp/.</description>

      <title>LAMP-PRo: Label-aware Attention for Multi-label Prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding Proteins using Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.</description>

      <title>Spherical Radiomics -- A Novel Approach to Glioblastoma Radiogenomic Analysis of Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and validate a novel spherical radiomics framework for predicting key molecular biomarkers using multiparametric MRI. Conventional Cartesian radiomics extract tumor features on orthogonal grids, which do not fully capture the tumor's radial growth patterns and can be insensitive to evolving molecular signatures. In this study, we analyzed GBM radiomic features on concentric 2D shells, which were then mapped onto 2D planes for radiomics analysis. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics from four different regions in GBM. Feature selection was performed using ANOVA F-statistics. Classification was conducted with multiple machine-learning models. Model interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis, clustering analysis, feature significance profiling, and comparison between radiomic patterns and underlying biological processes. Spherical radiomics consistently outperformed conventional 2D and 3D Cartesian radiomics across all prediction tasks. The best framework reached an AUC of 0.85 for MGMT, 0.80 for EGFR, 0.80 for PTEN, and 0.83 for survival prediction. GLCM-derived features were identified as the most informative predictors. Radial transition analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates that transition slopes between T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion regions, as well as between T2 intense lesion and a 2 cm peritumoral expansion region, are significantly associated with biomarker status. Furthermore, the observed radiomic changes along the radial direction closely reflected known biological characteristics. Radiomic features extracted on the spherical surfaces at varying radial distances to the GBM tumor centroid are better correlated with important tumor molecular markers and patient survival than the conventional Cartesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Computer Navigated Spinal Surgery Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh. Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.</description>
