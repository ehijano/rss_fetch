      <title>Holographic thermodynamics of a charged AdS black holes with global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By regarding the Newton constant {G}N and cosmological constant {\Lambda} as variables, we in this paper study the thermodynamics and phase transition of Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole with global monopole in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence. It is found that there are interesting critical phenomena and phase behaviors in the (grand) canonical ensembles of fixed (Q, V, C), ({\Phi}, V, C) and (Q, V, {\mu}). When the other parameters are fixed, the free energy increases with the global monopole increases. In (Q, V, C) ensemble, the range of unstable region increases with the increase of global monopole. In ({\Phi}, V, C) ensemble, when {\Phi} &lt; {\Phi}c, the free energy appears two branches, the upper and lower branches correspond to low entropy and high entropy respectively. When (Q, V, {\mu}) is fixed, a new zero-order phase transition occurs in the high-entropy phase and the low-entropy phase at certain {\mu}-dependent temperatures. When {\mu} increases to a certain value, this zero-order phase transition disappears. This certain value is positively related to the magnitude of the global monopole. Finally, we find that p-V criticality does not appear with the change of global monopole. Therefore, it is important to note that the CFT states of charged black holes with global monopole do not correspond to Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we find that charged black holes with global monopoles can better reflect thermodynamic phase transitions and critical phenomena under the AdS/CFT correspondence. By adjusting the change of the global monopole, the thermodynamic phase transition will also change.</description>

      <title>Anthropic Selection for a Low-Entropy Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of thermodynamic entropy is dependent on one's assignment of physical microstates to observed macrostates. As a result, low entropy in the distant past could be equivalently explained by selection of a particular observer. In this paper, I make the case that because we observe a low-entropy past everywhere even as we look further and further away, anthropic selection over observers does not explain the non-equilibrium state of the observed cosmos. Under a uniform prior over possible world states, the probability of a non-equilibrium past, given our local observations, decreases to zero as the size of the world tends toward infinity. This claim is not dependent on choice of observer, unless the amount of information used to encode the observer's coarse-graining perception function scales linearly with the size of the world. As a result, for anthropic selection to choose a world like the one we live in, the initial state of a universe with size $N$ must be low-information, having Kolmogorov complexity that does not scale with $N$.</description>

      <title>Decomposition squared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we test and extend a proposal of Gu, Pei, and Zhang for an application of decomposition to three-dimensional theories with one-form symmetries and to quantum K theory. The theories themselves do not decompose, but, OPEs of parallel one-dimensional objects (such as Wilson lines) and dimensional reductions to two dimensions do decompose, in two independent ways. We apply this to extend conjectures for quantum K theory rings of gerbes (realized by three-dimensional gauge theories with one-form symmetries) via both orbifold partition functions and gauged linear sigma models.</description>

      <title>Gravitons on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study free graviton entanglement between Rindler wedges in the Minkowski vacuum state via the Euclidean path integral. We follow Kabat's method for computing the conical entropy, using the heat kernel on the cone with the tip removed, whose resulting von Neumann entropy for photons correctly predicted electromagnetic edge modes. We find that, in addition to the bulk graviton contributions, the conical entropy has a contact term that can be attributed to a vector field anchored to the (d-2)-dimensional (Euclidean) Rindler horizon whose contribution equals d-2 times Kabat's contact term for photons. We suggest that graviton edge modes are hence the d-2 large diffeomorphisms which act internally within the Rindler horizon. Along the way, we address several known issues regarding graviton entanglement. We furthermore sketch how our results may be used to study edge modes in closed bosonic string theory.</description>

      <title>A Diamond of Infrared Equivalences in Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a tree-level equivalence between four distinct infrared objects in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories. These are ($i$) the large gauge charge $Q_\varepsilon$ where the function $\varepsilon$ on the sphere parameterizing large gauge transformations is identified with the Goldstone mode $\theta$ of spontaneously broken large gauge symmetry; ($ii$) the soft effective action that captures the dynamics of the soft and Goldstone modes; ($iii$) the edge mode action with Neumann boundary conditions; and ($iv$) the Wilson line dressing of a scattering amplitude, including a novel dressing for soft photons, which have local charge distributions despite having vanishing global charge. The promotion of the large gauge parameter to the dynamical Goldstone and the novel dressing of soft gauge particles give rise to intriguing possibilities for the future study of infrared dynamics of gauge theories and gravity.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and chaos bound in slow-rotating curved acoustic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the incorporation of acoustic black holes into Schwarzschild spacetime has enabled the simultaneous existence of event and acoustic horizons, as derived from the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. This paper investigates the dynamics of a particle-like vortex in free fall as it approaches the horizon of a curved slowly-rotating acoustic black hole, specifically within the context of the Lens-Thirring spacetime. We analyze the circular orbits of vortices around the acoustic black hole and delve into the chaotic motion of the vortex at the unstable equilibrium in the vicinity of the horizon. Furthermore, we explore whether a universal bound exists for the Lyapunov exponent characterising this chaotic motion, drawing parallels to the known bounds for the particle motion in general relativity. We anticipate that future experiments will be able to corroborate these findings.</description>

      <title>Communication protocols and QECC from the perspective of TQFT, Part II: QECCs as spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption lan- guage for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. In the accompanying Part I, we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) on the agent-environment boundary. Such QECCs can be regarded as implementing or inducing the emergence of spacetimes on such boundaries. Here we investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime, exploiting different realizations of TQFT. We delve into TQFTs that support on their boundaries spin-networks as computational systems: these are known as topological quan- tum neural networks (TQNNs). TQNNs, which have a natural representation as tensor networks, implement QECC. We recognize into the HaPPY code a paradigmatic example. We then show how generic QECCs, as bulk-boundary codes, induce effective spacetimes. The effective spatial and temporal separations that take place in QECC enables LOCC protocols between spatially separated observers. We then consider the implementation of QECCs in BF and Chern-Simons theories, and show that QECC-induced spacetimes provide the classical redundancy required for LOCC. Finally, we consider topological M-theory as an implementation of QECC in higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous contribution, we introduced a matrix formulation of a three-dimensional quantum space named the fuzzy onion. The novel part of the construction is the radial derivative term, which has been defined to recover the correct continuum limit. Here, we describe a numerical simulation of the scalar field theory in this space and test some physical properties of the model with emphasis on the interaction between neighbouring layers.</description>

      <title>Unifying Monopole and Center Vortex as the Semiclassical Confinement Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic excitations play a crucial role in understanding the color confinement of $4$d Yang-Mills theory, and we have the monopole and the center vortex as plausible candidates to explain its mechanism. Under suitable compactified setups of $4$d Yang-Mills theory, we can achieve different weakly-coupled descriptions of confinement phenomena: The monopole mechanism takes place on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with the double-trace deformation, and the center-vortex mechanism is effective on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with the 't Hooft flux. We unify these two semiclassical descriptions by showing the explicit relation between the monopole and center vortex.</description>

      <title>Integrable Structure of Higher Spin CFT and the ODE/IM Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two dimensional systems with extended conformal symmetry generated by the ${\mathcal W}_3$ algebra. These are expected to have an infinite number of commuting conserved charges, which we refer to as the quantum Boussinesq charges. We compute the eigenvalues of the quantum Boussinesq charges in both the vacuum and first excited states of the higher spin module through the ODE/IM correspondence. By studying the higher spin conformal field theory on the torus, we also calculate thermal correlators involving the energy-momentum tensor and the spin-3 current by making use of the Zhu recursion relations. By combining these results, we show that it is possible to derive the current densities, whose integrals are the quantum Boussinesq charges. We also evaluate the thermal expectation values of the conserved charges, and show that these are quasi-modular differential operators acting on the character of the higher spin module.</description>

      <title>Local Supersymmetry Enhancement and Black Hole Microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In string theory, black holes can be made from brane systems that are partially delocalized in string theory's extra dimensions. It is expected that they correspond to an ensemble of pure, horizonless microstates sourced by localized versions of this brane system. This thesis aims at studying the relationship between supersymmetric black holes and their microstates. In particular, we apply a concept called local supersymmetry enhancement to 1/4-BPS and 1/8-BPS systems that correspond to two-, three-, and four-charge black holes. This concept locally increases the number of preserved supercharges to 16 by adding dipole charges to the system. These bound states are then expected to be horizonless and describe the microstates of the black hole. First, we list all dipole charges for 1/4-BPS systems in Type II string theory. Then, we apply these to generate two structures to enhance 1/8-BPS systems, one with exclusively internal dipole charges and the other with a non-trivial shape in the non-compact dimensions. Thus, we identify the dipole charges for the microstates of various supersymmetric black holes, including new internal dipole charges for the D1-D5-P black hole and external ones for the D2-D2-D2-D6 black hole. These dipole charges reveal the local structure of the black hole's microstates and will be used in the construction of the corresponding supergravity solutions.</description>

      <title>A Symmetry-centric Perspective on the Geometry of the String Landscape and the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As famously observed by Ooguri and Vafa nearly twenty years ago, scalar field moduli spaces in quantum gravity appear to exhibit various universal features. For instance, they seem to be infinite in diameter, have trivial fundamental group, and feature towers of massive particles that become light in their asymptotic limits. In this essay, we explain how these features can be reformulated in more modern language using generalized notions of global symmetries. Such symmetries are ubiquitous in non-gravitational quantum field theories, but it is widely believed that they must be either gauged or broken in quantum gravity. In what follows, we will see that the observations of Ooguri and Vafa can be understood as consequences of such gauging or breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for local temperature variations and the ensuing stochastic effects. This framework provides a deeper understanding of energy balance, second law of thermodynamics, and thermostated steady states in active matter, while also addressing the systematic violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorem and detailed balance. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, using von Neumann entropy we examine the entanglement entropy for the neutrino oscillations in the presence of the subsequent phase shift. We numerically show that the entanglement entropy for the subsequent periods of the two-flavor neutrino oscillations increases asymmetrically with time depending on the space-time deformation. We also explored the obtained results for the three-flavor neutrino oscillations to show that this result is also valid for the three-flavor neutrino oscillations. These results, obtained for the first time in this Letter, are quite different from the computing for the standard neutrino oscillation theory. We concluded that these interesting results play an important role in the cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We propose that the spectrum of the surface area of the apparent horizon (AH) of de Sitter (dS) spacetime leads to corrected temperature and entropy of the dS spacetime, offering new insights into its thermodynamic properties. This is done by employing the spectrum of the AH radius, acquired from the Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation, together with the Stefan--Boltzmann law, the time-energy uncertainty relation, and the unified first law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter aims to advance novel properties of a class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity [Universe 9, 467 (2023)]. Therein, it was shown that a wormhole acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions under rainbow gravity effects in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relativistic energy spectrum for Dirac fermions under rainbow gravity effects in the $(3+1)$-dimensional Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime, where we work with the curved Dirac equation in cylindrical coordinates. Using the tetrads formalism of General Relativity and considering a first-order approximation for the trigonometric functions, we obtain a Bessel equation. To solve this differential equation, we also consider a region where a hard-wall confining potential is present (i.e., some finite distance where the radial wave function is null). In other words, we define a second boundary condition (Dirichlet boundary condition) to achieve the quantization of the energy. Consequently, we obtain the spectrum for a fermion/antifermion, which is quantized in terms of quantum numbers $n$, $m_j$ and $m_s$, where $n$ is the radial quantum number, $m_j$ is the total magnetic quantum number, $m_s$ is the spin magnetic quantum number, and explicitly depends on the rainbow functions $F(\xi)$ and $G(\xi)$, curvature parameter $\alpha$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$, fixed radius $r_0$, and on the rest energy $m_0$, and $z$-momentum $p_z$. So, analyzing this spectrum according to the values of $m_j$ and $m_s$, we see that for $m_j&gt;0$ with $m_s=-1/2$ (positive angular momentum and spin down), and for $m_j&lt;0$ with $m_s=+1/2$ (negative angular momentum and spin up), the spectrum is the same. Besides, we graphically analyze in detail the behavior of the spectrum for the three scenarios of rainbow gravity as a function of $\Lambda$, $r_0$, and $\alpha$ for three different values of $n$ (ground state and the first two excited states).</description>

      <title>Electric field induction in quark-gluon plasma due to thermoelectric effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is locally thermalized. QGP with higher thermal conductivity advances towards global thermalization. Being made of electrically charged particles (quarks), QGP exhibits interesting thermoelectric phenomena during its evolution, resulting in the induction of an electric field in the medium. For the first time, we estimate the induced electric field in the QGP due to thermoelectric effect. This can be seen even in the QGP produced in the head-on collisions. The Seebeck coefficient is essential in determining the induced field. However, spectator current can produce a magnetic field in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. This breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric coefficient matrix and introduces magneto-Seebeck and Nernst coefficients that contribute to the induced electric field in peripheral collisions. We have taken care of the temperature evolution of QGP with different hydrodynamic cooling rates to calculate the transport coefficients. The induced electric field is estimated with the cooling rate obtained from Gubser hydrodynamic flow. We estimated the space-time profile of the induced field and found that it is zero at the center and increases as we go away from the center. At the early time of evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, and the strength decreases in time. Moreover, we estimated the transport coefficients in the presence of the external time-varying magnetic field. The effect of the intensity and decay parameter of the magnetic field on the induced electric field is also explored.</description>

Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity is highly successful in explaining a wide range of gravitational phenomena including the gravitational waves emitted by binary systems and the shadows cast by supermassive black holes. From a modern perspective the theory is not fundamental though, but constitutes the lowest order term in an effective field theory description of the gravitational force. As a consequence, the gravitational dynamics should receive corrections by higher-derivative terms. This essay discusses structural aspects associated with these corrections and summarizes their imprint on static, spherically symmetric geometries. Along these lines, we critically reassess the common practice of using local field redefinitions in order to simplify the dynamics at the danger of shifting physics effects into sectors which are beyond the approximation under consideration.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian multiform for cyclotomic Gaudin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian multiform for the class of cyclotomic (rational) Gaudin models by formulating its hierarchy within the Lie dialgebra framework of Semenov-Tian-Shansky and by using the framework of Lagrangian multiforms on coadjoint orbits. This provides the first example of a Lagrangian multiform for an integrable hierarchy whose classical $r$-matrix is non-skew-symmetric and spectral parameter-dependent. As an important by-product of the construction, we obtain a Lagrangian multiform for the periodic Toda chain by choosing an appropriate realisation of the cyclotomic Gaudin Lax matrix. This fills a gap in the landscape of Toda models as only the open and infinite chains had been previously cast into the Lagrangian multiform framework. A slightly different choice of realisation produces the so-called DST model. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by coupling the periodic Toda chain with the DST model and by obtaining a Lagrangian multiform for the corresponding integrable hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: Sandwich gravitational waves exhibit the velocity memory effect (VM) which however can become, for specific values of the wave parameters, pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. Fixing such a "miraculous" value, the particle trajectory is an (approximate) standing wave characterized by a unique integer $m$, for which the particle does not absorb any energy from the passing wave. Our statements are illustrated by a simple Gaussian and by the P\"oschl-Teller potential as profiles.</description>

Abstract: The action growth proposal relates the holographic complexity to the value of the action on the Wheeler-de Witt patch. We introduce a new method of calculating the gravitational action using the "bulk" term, i.e. the part of the Einstein-Hilbert action quadratic in connection coefficients. We demonstrate how to address the issue of non-covariance of the bulk action and evaluate it using the tetrad formalism. Due to the boundary term-free nature of the bulk action, we can gain further insights into the spatial structure of the action on the Wheeler-de Witt patch. We then argue that our entire scheme can be naturally covariantized within the framework of teleparallel geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider rigid-body quantization of the Skyrmion in the most general four-derivative generalization of the Skyrme model with a potential giving pions a mass, as well as in a class of higher-order Skyrme models. We quantize the spin and isospin zeromodes following the results of Pottinger and Rathske. Although one could hope that a one-parameter family of theories could provide a smaller spin contribution to the energy at some point in theory space -- which would be welcome for BPS-type models, we find that the standard Skyrme model limit, with two time derivatives, gives rise to the smallest spin contribution to the energy. We speculate whether this tuning of the spin energy could be useful in the larger picture of quantizing vibrational and light massive modes of the Skyrmions. Finally, we establish a topological energy bound for the Pottinger-Rathske model with potential terms as well as new bounds for higher-order Skyrme models, with and without a potential.</description>

      <title>Discrete Global Symmetries: Gauging and Twisted Compactification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete global symmetries of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs are studied via two operations: gauging and twisted compactification. We consider gauging of discrete symmetries in several well-known 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs, including $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ SQCD with $2n$ flavors, theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of type $A_{2n-1}$, and Argyres--Douglas theories of type $(A_N, A_N)$, as well as propose new 4d SCFTs as a result. The wreathing technique, which involves gauging a subgroup of the automorphism group of the quiver diagram of the corresponding 3d mirror theory, is exploited. This allows us to understand several properties of discretely gauged theories, including moduli spaces and how discrete gauging affects the mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the 1-form symmetry and the 0-form flavor symmetry. Many examples are viewed through the lens of the Argyres--Seiberg duality and its generalization. We also examine discrete gauging of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ SQCD with 4 flavors by various $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroups of the permutation group $S_4$ using the superconformal index. Regarding compactification, we propose a magnetic quiver for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ SQCD with $2n$ flavors compactified on a circle with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ twist. The twisted compactification by non-invertible symmetries of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory with gauge group $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ is revisited. The non-invertible symmetry naturally gives rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_k$ action on the scalar fields parametrizing the moduli space. Upon examining the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ invariant chiral ring of the Higgs branch, we find that, in addition to the largest branch of the moduli space that is expected to be captured by the ABJ(M) theory, there exist in general nilpotent operators that lead to a branch of the moduli space which is a radical ideal.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Dynamics and Critical Phenomena in the Holographic Landscape of Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of critical phenomena in a holographic Weyl semi-metal (WSM) using the $D3/D7$ brane configuration. The research explores the non-linear response of the longitudinal current \( J \) when subjected to an external electric field \( E \) at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, the study identifies a potential quantum phase transition in the \( J \)-\( E \) relationship, driven by background parameters the particle mass, and axial gauge potential. This transition is characterized by a unique reconnection phenomenon resulting from the interplay between WSM-like and conventional nonlinear conducting behaviors, indicating a quantum phase transition.
  Additionally, at non-zero temperature with dissipation, the system demonstrates first- and second-order phase transitions as the electric field and axial gauge potential are varied. The longitudinal conductivity is used as an order parameter to identify the current-driven phase transition. Numerical analysis reveals critical exponents in this non-equilibrium phase transition that show similarities to mean-field values observed in metallic systems.</description>

Abstract: The $4$-dimensional semi-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory of Costello and Yamazaki provides a gauge-theoretic origin for the Lax connection of $2$-dimensional integrable field theories. The purpose of this paper is to extend this framework to the setting of $3$-dimensional integrable field theories by considering a $5$-dimensional semi-holomorphic higher Chern-Simons theory for a higher connection $(A,B)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{C}P^1$. The input data for this theory are the choice of a meromorphic $1$-form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and a strict Lie $2$-group with cyclic structure on its underlying Lie $2$-algebra. Integrable field theories on $\mathbb{R}^3$ are constructed by imposing suitable boundary conditions on the connection $(A,B)$ at the $3$-dimensional defects located at the poles of $\omega$ and choosing certain admissible meromorphic solutions of the bulk equations of motion. The latter provides a natural notion of higher Lax connection for $3$-dimensional integrable field theories, including a $2$-form component $B$ which can be integrated over Cauchy surfaces to produce conserved charges. As a first application of this approach, we show how to construct a generalization of Ward's $(2+1)$-dimensional integrable chiral model from a suitable choice of data in the $5$-dimensional theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1804.05460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the permutohedral geometry of the poles of a certain differential form introduced in recent work of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, He and Yan. There it was observed that the poles of the form determine a family of polyhedra which have the same face lattice as that of the permutohedron. We realize that family explicitly, proving that it in fact fills out the configuration space of a particularly well-behaved family of generalized permutohedra, the zonotopal generalized permutohedra, that are obtained as the Minkowski sums of line segments parallel to the root directions $e_i-e_j$.
  Finally we interpret Mizera's formula for the biadjoint scalar amplitude $m(\mathbb{I}_n,\mathbb{I}_n)$, restricted to a certain dimension $n-2$ subspace of the kinematic space, as a sum over the boundary components of the standard root cone, which is the conical hull of the roots $e_1-e_2,\ldots, e_{n-2}-e_{n-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I argue that the rules of unitary quantum mechanics imply that observers who will themselves be subject to measurements in a linear combination of macroscopic states (``cat" measurements) cannot make reliable predictions on the results of experiments performed after such measurements. This lifts the inconsistency in the interpretation of quantum mechanics recently identified by Frauchiger and Renner. The Born rules for calculating the probability of outcomes and for communicating with other observers do not generally apply for cat-measured observers, nor can they generally be amended to incorporate upcoming cat measurements. Quantum mechanical rules completed with these conditions become fully consistent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16946v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the ground state structure of quantum models with all-to-all interactions such as mean-field quantum spin glass models and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we propose a tensor network architecture which can accomodate volume law entanglement and a large ground state degeneracy. We call this architecture the non-local renormalization ansatz (NoRA) because it can be viewed as a generalization of MERA, DMERA, and branching MERA networks with the constraints of spatial locality removed. We argue that the architecture is potentially expressive enough to capture the entanglement and complexity of the ground space of the SYK model, thus making it a suitable variational ansatz, but we leave a detailed study of SYK to future work. We further explore the architecture in the special case in which the tensors are random Clifford gates. Here the architecture can be viewed as the encoding map of a random stabilizer code. We introduce a family of codes inspired by the SYK model which can be chosen to have constant rate and linear distance at the cost of some high weight stabilizers. We also comment on potential similarities between this code family and the approximate code formed from the SYK ground space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine whether or not H II starburst galaxies (H IIG) are standardizable candles, we study the correlation between the H$\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from H IIG measurements by simultaneously constraining the $L-\sigma$ relation parameters and the cosmological model parameters. We investigate six flat and nonflat relativistic dark energy cosmological models. We find that low-redshift and high-redshift H IIG data subsets are standardizable but obey different $L-\sigma$ relations. Current H IIG data are too sparse and too non-uniformly distributed in redshift to allow for a determination of why the samples follow different relations, but it could be caused by the high-redshift sample containing relatively fewer intrinsically dimmer sources (Malmquist bias) or it could be a consequence of H IIG evolution. Until this issue is better understood, H IIG data cosmological constraints must be treated with caution.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the findings presented in the first three papers of this series, we formulate an effective field theory for interacting collective states. These states consist of a large number of interconnected neurons and are distinguished by their intrinsic activity. The field theory encompasses an infinite set of fields, each of which characterizes the dynamics of a specific type of collective state. Interaction terms within the theory drive transitions between various collective states, allowing us to describe processes such as activation, association, and deactivation of these states.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectra of black holes in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in electrically charged black brane spacetimes that asymptote to AdS by means of the pseudospectrum. Methodologically, we adopt ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to cast QNMs in terms of a generalised eigenvalue problem involving a non-selfadjoint operator; this simplifies the computation significantly in comparison with previous results in the literature. Our analysis reveals spectral instability for (neutral) scalar as well as gravitoelectric perturbations. This indicates that the equilibration process of perturbed black branes is sensitive to external perturbations. Particular attention is given on the hydrodynamic modes, which are found to be the least unstable. In contrast with computations in hyperboloidal coordinates, we find that the pseudospectral contour lines cross to the upper half plane. This indicates the existence of pseudo-resonances as well as the possibility of transient instabilities. We also investigate the asymptotic structure of pseudospectral contour levels and we find remarkable universality across all sectors, persistent in the extremal limit.</description>

      <title>Acausality in truncated 'MIS'-type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The causal-stable Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory is known to have a finite number of out of equilibrium derivative order corrections but requires treating the viscosity tensor as a separate degree of freedom with its own equations of motion, apart from the fundamental fluid degrees of freedom like velocity and temperature. In this work, I will show that it is possible to rewrite the MIS theory only in terms of velocity and temperature, but the resultant constitutive relation for dissipation must include all orders of gradient corrections. In this work I will argue that an all-order resummation of gradient contributions is equivalent to introducing new `non-fluid' degrees of freedom in the MIS theory. It will also be shown, using the relativistic quantum causality condition, that any finitely truncated order of derivative correction, however high it is, leads to a theory that is acausal, unless the corrections are infinitely summed up to all orders.</description>

      <title>A unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity of the metric-affine geometry with the M\"{o}bius representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical fundamentals for a unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity 2-forms in the way extending the so-called M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group, which is the method to convert the semi-direct product into the ordinary matrix product, to revive the fertility of gauge theories of gravity. First of all, we illustrate the basic concepts for constructing the metric-affine geometry. Then the curvature and torsion 2-forms are described in a unified manner by using the Cartan connection of the M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group. In this unified-description, the curvature and torsion are derived by Cartan's structure equation with respect to a common connection 1-form. After that, extending the M\"{o}bius representation, the dilation and shear 2-forms, or equivalently, the non-metricity 2-form, are introduced in the same unified manner. Based on the unified-description established in this paper, introducing a new group parametrization and applying the In\"{o}n\"{u}-Wigner group contraction to the full theory, the relationships among symmetries, geometric quantities, and geometries are investigated with respect to the three gauge groups: the metric-affine group and its extension, and an extension of the (anti)-de Sitter group in which the non-metricity exists. Finally, possible applications to theories of gravity are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A lattice formulation of Weyl fermions on a single curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard lattice domain-wall fermion formulation, one needs two flat domain-walls where both of the left- and right-handed massless modes appear. In this work we investigate a single domain-wall system with a nontrivial curved background. Specifically we consider a massive fermion on a $3D$ square lattice, whose domain-wall is a $2D$ sphere. In the free theory, we find that a single Weyl fermion is localized at the wall and it feels gravity through the induced spin connection. With a topologically nontrivial $U(1)$ link gauge field, however, we find a zero mode with the opposite chirality localized at the center where the gauge field is singular. In the latter case, the low-energy effective theory is not chiral but vectorlike. We discuss how to circumvent this obstacle in formulating lattice chiral gauge theory in the single domain-wall fermion system.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roy-equation analyses on lattice data of $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shifts at $m_\pi=391$MeV reveals that the lowest $f_0$ meson becomes a bound state under this condition. In addition, there is a pair of complex poles below threshold generated by crossing symmetry [X.-H. Cao et al., Phys. Rev. D 108, 034009 (2023)]. We use the $N/D$ method to partially recover crossing symmetry of the $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model amplitude at leading order of $1/N$ expansion, and qualitatively reproduce the pole structure and pole trajectories with varying pion masses as revealed by Roy-equation analyses. The $\sigma$ pole trajectory with varying temperature is also discussed and found to be similar to its properties when varying $m_\pi$. As the temperature increases, the complex $\sigma$ poles firstly move from the second Riemann sheet to the real axis becoming two virtual state poles, and then one virtual state pole moves to the first sheet turning into a bound state pole and finally tends to the pion pole position at high temperature which is as expected from the chiral symmetry restoration. Our results provide further evidences that the lowest $f_0$ state extracted from experiments and lattice data plays the role of $\sigma$ meson in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Finally, we also briefly discuss the problems of the effective potential in the situation when $m_\pi$ and temperature get large.</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>A study of the fine-structure constant dependence of radiative capture in Halo-EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This provides a solution to a longstanding mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>

      <title>Probing Massive Fields with Multi-Band Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multi-band observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16}$ eV to $10^{-15}$ eV, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the milli-Hertz band observations alone. Multi-band observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multi-band observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>
