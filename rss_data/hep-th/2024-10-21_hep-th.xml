      <title>M-theory geometric engineering for rank-0 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-theory geometric engineering on non-compact Calabi-Yau fourfolds (CY4) produces 3d theories with 4 supercharges. Carefully establishing a dictionary between the geometry of the CY4 and the QFT in the transverse directions remains, to a large extent, an unresolved challenge, complicated by subtleties arising from M5-brane instanton corrections. Such difficulties can be circumvented in the restricted and yet controlled setting offered by CY4 with terminal singularities, as they do not admit crepant resolutions with compact exceptional divisors. After a general review of their properties and partial classifications, we focus on a subclass of terminal CY4 constructed as deformed Du Val singularities, that admit crepant resolutions with at most exceptional 2-cycles. We extract the corresponding 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theory descendant in an unambiguous fashion, as the absence of compact 4-cycles leaves no room for a choice of background $G_4$ flux. These turn out to be theories of chiral multiplets with no gauge group and at most abelian flavor factors: we argue that they serve as the simplest building blocks to substantiate a rigorous CY4/3d QFT geometric engineering mapping.</description>

      <title>Singularity Structure of the Four Point Celestial Leaf Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the four-point celestial leaf amplitudes of massless scalar and MHV gluon scattering. These leaf amplitudes are non-distributional decompositions of the celestial amplitudes associated with a hyperbolic foliation of the Klein spacetime. Bulk scale invariance imposes constraints on the total conformal weights of the massless scalars or gluons. Using this constraint we show that the four-point leaf amplitudes have a \textit {simple pole singularity at $ z = \bar z $}, where, $ z,\bar z $ are two real independent conformal cross ratios. The distributional nature of the four-point celestial amplitudes is recovered by adding the leaf amplitudes in the timelike and spacelike wedges of the spacetime. We also verify that the MHV gluon leaf amplitudes satisfy a set of differential equations previously obtained for celestial MHV gluon amplitudes by considering the soft gluon theorems and the subleading terms in the OPE expansion between two positive helicity gluons.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing from previous work on the integer quantum Hall effect, we construct the effective action for the analog of Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions. The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.</description>

      <title>Higher form symmetries, membranes and flux quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher Forms Symmetries (HFS) of a closed bosonic M2-brane theory formulated from the world-volume perspective on a compactified target space $\mathcal{M}_9 \times T^2$ are obtained. We show that the cancellation of the 't Hooft anomaly present in the theory is related to a 3-form flux with 1-gerbe structure associated to the world-volume flux quantization condition. A Wilson surface is naturally defined on the topological operator that characterize the holonomy of the M2-brane. The projection of the flux quantization condition onto the spatial part of the worldvolume, leads to a flux quantization on the M2-brane. The topological operators realise discrete symmetries associated with the winding and the flux/monopole condition. The algebra of operators is well defined.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical properties of baryon rich thermal plasma with flavour quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we holographically study the hydrodynamical properties of strongly coupled $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM baryon rich thermal plasma with large number of flavour quarks. Specifically, we study the drag force acting on the moving heavy probe quark and corresponding energy loss. We also study the jet quenching parameter, screening length and binding energy of the quark-antiquark pair. Due to the presence of finite baryon density and flavour quarks the drag force, energy loss, jet quenching parameter and binding energy of the quark-antiquark pair are enhanced for the increase in temperature. However, the screening length of the quark-antiquark pair is reduced, leading to the thermal plasma phase being achieved at a lower temperature, which is consistent with the thermal phase diagram of the quark-gluon plasma. We observed that the perpendicular orientation of quark-antiquark pair with respect to the direction of motion deconfined early compare to the parallel orientation once temperature raises.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in an evaporating black hole through non-isometric map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole information paradox has been an important problem in quantum gravity. In the study of evaporating black hole, it has been proposed that the holographic map between the semi-classical effective description in bulk and the fundamental description in boundary cannot be isometric. In this work, we would like to study the reflected entropy in an evaporating black hole model through non-isometric holographic map. We assume that the evaporating is slowly enough that it makes sense to ascribe a slowly varying temperature to the Hawking radiation. We then introduce a two-sided black hole model to canonically purify the semi-classical state. The holographic map to the fundamental description is non-isometric and defined by a Haar random unitary matrix. We show that the entanglement entropy of the radiation in the model matches the result read from the quantum extremal surface formula and agrees with the Page curve. Furthermore, we study the reflected entropies between different regions, including the one between the black holes on different sides, the one between the radiations distributed symmetrically but disconnectedly, and the one between the black hole and the radiation on single side. Our results are consistent with the existing ones based on the effective descriptions.</description>

      <title>To stealth or not to stealth: Thermodynamics of stealth black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Euclidean methods we investigate the thermodynamics of stealth black hole solutions, which are solutions that geometrically are indistinguishable from those of general relativity, however they are accompanied by a non-trivial additional field that does not back-react to the metric. We find that in general, one can observe shifts in the mass and/or the entropy of such black holes, hence, at least at the thermodynamic level, the stealth solutions may be distinguished by the those of general relativity. We also point out an example, the {\it{bona fide stealth}}, where a non-trivial scalar field can accompany an (A)dS-Schwarzschild black hole without altering the thermodynamic quantities. We point out that thermodynamic discrepancies arise due to the additional boundary terms emanating from the stealth fields, where care should be given in order for the theory at hand to possess a well-defined variational procedure.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology, Photon Spheres, and Evidence for Weak Gravity Conjecture in Charged Black Holes with Perfect Fluid within Rastall Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) within the context of photon spheres in charged black holes, framed by Perfect Fluid in Rastall Theory. We aim to validate the WGC by identifying the extremality states of these black holes. We highlight the interplay between quantum dynamics and gravitational forces, opening new avenues in high-energy physics and quantum gravity. Our analysis reveals significant system changes with varying perfect fluid intensity $(\alpha)$ and Rastall parameters ( $k$ and $\lambda$ ). For dust field $(\omega=0)$, the WGC is met in extremality $(T=0)$ with $(Q / M)_{\text {ext }}&gt;1$, indicating a black hole due to the presence of photon spheres (PS) with a total charge-1. However, further increases in $k$ and $\lambda$ or decreases $(\alpha)$ lead to $P S=0$ that determines a singularity, not a black hole. We observed that the radiation field $(\omega=1 / 3)$, quintessence field ( $\omega=-2 / 3$ ), and phantom fields field ( $\omega=-4 / 3$ ) also confirmed the WGC and maintaining a total charge of $P S=-1$ in some regions of the free parameters. Our numerical solutions identify points satisfying the WGC, establishing a bridge between quantum and cosmic realms. The results are summarized in Table (I). We also examine Duans topological current $\phi$-mapping theory by analyzing generalized Helmholtz free energy methods to study the topological classes of our black hole. We reveal that for given values of the free parameters, the total topological numbers $(W=0)$ exist for the generalized Helmholtz free energy method for $\omega=0,1 / 3,-2 / 3,-4 / 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions to determine whether a D=3 gauged maximal supergravity can be obtained from consistent Kaluza-Klein truncation of ten- or eleven-dimensional supergravity. We describe the procedure to identify the internal geometry and explicitly construct the frame encoding the reduction ansatz. As byproducts, we derive several results on twistings, deformations and global aspects of E$_8$ exceptional geometry and define E$_8$ generalised diffeomorphism for massive IIA supergravity. We devise simple algebraic conditions for imposing compactness of the internal space and derive no-go results for the uplift of compact gaugings and of a large class of gauged maximal supergravities with N=(8,0) AdS$_3$ solutions.</description>

      <title>Chiral gauge theories, generalized anomalies and breaking of the color-flavor-locked center symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong-interaction dynamics of a class of $4D$ chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories with a fermion in a symmetric second-rank tensor representation and a number of fermions in an anti-antisymmetric tensor representation, extending the previous work on chiral gauge theories such as the Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. The main tool of our analysis is the anomalies obstructing the gauging of certain 1-form color-flavor-locked center symmetry, together with some flavor symmetries. The matching requirement for these mixed-anomalies strongly favors dynamical Higgs phases caused by bifermion condensate formation, against a confinement phase with no condensates and no symmetry breaking, or a confinement phase with multifermion color-singlet condensates only. Dynamical gauge symmetry breaking and the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry caused by such condensates mean that the color-flavor-locked 1-form center symmetry itself is lost in the infrared. One is led to a solution, if not unique, which satisfies fully the conventional as well as the new, generalized 't Hooft anomaly matching requirements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The D0-brane/Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix theory is a strongly coupled quantum system with an interesting gravity dual. We develop a scheme to derive bootstrap bounds on simple correlators in the matrix theory at infinite $N$ at zero energy by imposing the supercharge equations of motion. By exploiting SO(9) symmetry, we are able to consider single-trace operators involving words of length up to 9 using very modest computational resources. We interpret our initial results as strong evidence that the bootstrap method can efficiently access physics in the strongly coupled, infinite $N$ regime.</description>

      <title>Mass Prediction of the Weak and Higgs Bosons Using the Massless Spin-Exchange Preons Model: An Alternative to the Higgs Mechanism in Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We modify the Yang-Mills model using massless preon pairs to describe the photon isospin singlet and the Z and W bosons. Unlike the Higgs mechanism, which depends on a scalar field, our model employs Gell-Mann generators, revealing that the masses of W and Z bosons arise from the internal dynamics of chiral preon pairs. With no adjustable parameters, we predict 0.87 (experimental value: 0.88), a Weinberg angle of 30{\deg} (vs. 29{\deg}), and a decay width ratio of 0.87 (vs. 0.84). Additionally, we find (vs. 1.56) for the Higgs boson. Our approach introduces a curl operator leading to chirality, characterized by a topological structure of M\"obius tori, providing new insights into particle interactions and challenging existing theoretical paradigms.</description>

      <title>Tensor Integrals in the Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for evaluating tensor integrals in the large-scale structure. Decomposing a $\Lambda$CDM-like universe into a finite sum of scaling universes using the FFTLog, we can recast loop integrals for biased tracers in the large-scale structure as certain tensor integrals in quantum field theory. While rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken by the fixed reference frame in which biased tracers are observed, the tensor structures can still be organized to respect the underlying symmetry. Projecting the loop integrands for scaling universes onto spherical harmonics, the problem effectively reduces to the evaluation of one-dimensional radial integrals, which can be solved analytically. Using this method, we derive analytic expressions for the one-loop power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum for arbitrary multipole moments in the basis of scaling universes.</description>

      <title>Structure, maximum mass, and stability of compact stars in f(Q,T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physically based changes to general relativity (GR) often predict significant differences in how spacetime behaves near massive neutron stars. One of these modifications is represented by $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})$, with $\mathcal{Q}$ being the non-metricity and ${ \mathit{T}}$ representing the energy-momentum tensor trace. This theory is viewed as a neutral expansion of GR. Neutron stars weighing more than 1.8 times the mass of the Sun, when observed as radio pulsars, provide valuable opportunities to test fundamental physics under extreme conditions that are rare in the observable universe and cannot be replicated in experiments conducted on land. We derive an exact solution through utilizing the form $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})=\mathcal{Q}+\psi { \mathcal{T}}$, where $\psi$ represents a dimensional expression. We elucidate that all physical quantities within the star can be expressed using the dimensional parameter $\psi$ and the compactness, which is defined as $C=\frac{ 2GM}{Rc^2}$. We set $\psi$ to a maximum value of $\psi_1=\frac{\psi}{\kappa^2}=-0.04$ in the negative range, based on observational constraints related to radius and mass of the pulsar ${\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}$. Here, ${\mathrm \kappa^2}$ represents the coupling constant of Einstein, defined as ${\mathrm \kappa^2=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}}$. Unlike in GR, the solution we derived results in a stable compact object without violating the conjectured sound speed condition $c_s^2\leq\frac{c^2}3$.It is crucial to mention that no equations of state were assumed in this investigation. Nevertheless, our model fits nicely with linear form. Generally, when $\psi$ is negative, the theory predicts a star with a slightly larger size than GR for the same mass. The difference in predicted size between the theory with a negative $\psi$ and GR for the same mass is attributed to an additional force.</description>

      <title>Existence of Vacuum Wormholes in Einsteinian Cubic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wormhole solutions in gravitational theories typically require exotic matter. Here we present a wormhole solution to the field equations of Einsteinian Cubic Gravity -- a phenomenological competitor to general relativity that includes terms cubic in the curvature -- that has no matter, exotic or otherwise. These purely gravitational wormhole geometries are asymptotically AdS but contain a geometric deficit at infinity. The deficit, interpreted as a global monopole, plays an essential role in our construction. We find that our wormhole solution satisfies traversablility criteria. We also find, for different parameters, a range of possible wormhole solutions.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Conjecture Validation with Photon Spheres of Quantum Corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes in Kiselev Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in the context of quantum-corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom (AdS-RN) black holes within Kiselev spacetime. Our focus is on photon spheres, which serve as markers for stable and unstable photon spheres. We confirm the validity of the WGC by demonstrating that quantum corrections do not alter the essential charge-to-mass ratio, thereby supporting the conjecture's universality. Our analysis reveals that black holes with a charge greater than their mass ($Q &gt; M$) possess photon spheres or exhibit a total topological charge of the photon sphere (PS = -1), which upholds the WGC. This finding is significant as it reinforces the conjecture's applicability even in the presence of quantum corrections. Furthermore, we examine various parameter configurations to understand their impact on the WGC. Specifically, we find that configurations with $\omega = -\frac{1}{3}$ and $\omega = -1$ maintain the conjecture, indicating that these values do not disrupt the charge-to-mass ratio required by the WGC. However, for $\omega = -\frac{4}{3}$, the conjecture does not hold, suggesting that this particular parameter value leads to deviations from the expected behavior. These results open new directions for research in quantum gravity, as they highlight the importance of specific parameter values in maintaining the WGC. The findings suggest that while the WGC is robust under certain conditions, there are scenarios where it may be challenged, prompting further investigation into the underlying principles of quantum gravity</description>

      <title>Observational imprints from Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14435v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe that undergoes a period of exponential expansion very early on, named inflation. This stretches quantum fluctuations from the onset of inflation to cosmological scales, which seed the temperature, polarization and matter anisotropies that we observe. However, this paradigm ignores pre-inflationary physics, as shortly before inflation there is the initial big-bang singularity. Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is a promising approach to quantum cosmology. Its most outstanding result is that of the resolution of the classical initial singularity in terms of a quantum bounce that connects a contracting branch of the Universe with an expanding one. Consequently, it provides singularity-free pre-inflationary dynamics. Within this context, it is no longer justified to consider that every mode of the cosmological perturbations reaches the onset of inflation in the natural vacuum state of standard cosmology. In fact, some modes might reach it in an excited state, which may leave imprints in their power spectra at the end of inflation and therefore in observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The goal of this thesis is to search for such imprints from LQC in the CMB. We work in the hybrid approach to cosmological perturbations in LQC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Quantum Brownian motion of a point particle induced by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of a real massless scalar field in Einstein universe under Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is studied. Using the Wightman functions, general expressions for the renormalized dispersion of the physical momentum are derived. Distinct expressions are found for the dispersion associated with each component of the particle physical momentum, indicating that the global properties of homogeneity and isotropy of space are lost, as a consequence of the introduced boundary conditions. Divergences also arise and are related to the compact nature of Einstein universe and the introduced boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework for SU(2) lattice gauge theory, leveraging continuous variables instead of discrete qubits to represent the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the gauge fields. We consider a ladder as well as a two-dimensional grid of plaquettes, detailing the use of gauge fixing to reduce the degrees of freedom and simplify the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the system dynamics, ground states, and energy gaps can be computed using the continuous-variable approach to quantum computing. Our results indicate that it is feasible to study non-Abelian gauge theories with continuous variables, providing new avenues for understanding the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background anisotropies from inflation with non-Bunch-Davies states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that has been known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our analysis of open string field theory based on A-infinity-algebras obtained from Witten's theory by attaching stubs to the elementary vertex. Classical solutions of the new theory can be obtained from known analytic solutions in Witten's theory by applying a cohomomorphism. In a previous work, two such cohomomorphisms were found, one non-cyclic, obtained from the homological perturbation lemma and another cyclic one by geometric methods. Here we show that the two resulting maps are related by a combination of a gauge transformation and a term vanishing on-shell. In the second part of the paper we generalize the whole construction to non-BPZ even stubs, in particular sliver frame stubs. We discuss algebraic and geometric aspects and analyze the resulting conditions on the homotopy operator. Moreover, we explicitly calculate the first few orders of the new A-infinity-algebra solution for the tachyon vacuum in the sliver frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct closed string vertex operators with various ghost numbers in addition to the conventional ones, using the Faddeev-Popov procedure for the gauge fixing of the conformal Killing group, from matter primary fields. We find that these operators give solutions to the descent equations in the framework of the BRST formalism. Similarly, we also construct solutions to the descent equations for the dilaton vertex operator with the Lorentz covariant form. Using the unintegrated vertex operator of the dilaton with the ghost number three, we obtain the correct result of the tadpole amplitude on the disk, including a non-zero contribution from a BRST exact term which comes from a conformal transformation.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

      <title>Covariant operator formalism for higher derivative systems: Vector spin-$0$ dual model as a prelude to generalized QED$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we extend the Kugo-Ojima-Nakanishi covariant operator formalism to quantize two higher derivative systems, considering their extended phase space structures. More specifically, the one describing spin-$0$ particles by a vector field and the generalized electrodynamics. We investigate the commutator structure of these theories and present the definition of their physical Hilbert subspaces. The first model presents a reducible gauge symmetry, implying the necessity of two sets of auxiliary fields. The massless limit is also carefully analyzed. After this prelude, the generalized QED$_4$ can be investigated with such machinery. Regarding the interacting regime, the positive norm subspace is no longer time invariant, since the interaction can create negative norm states from an initially ghost-free one. Then, we furnish an alternative description of the situation by analyzing a set of spectral representations highlighting the lack of positivity associated with the well-known ultraviolet improvement. Finally, based on these efforts and also on recent discussions about Lee-Wick like models, we prove that it is possible to establish a specific higher derivative interacting model compatible with establishing a time-invariant positive norm subspace.</description>

      <title>Note on higher-group structure in 6d self-dual gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze higher-group structure of a 6d model coupled with a self-dual 2-form gauge field. This model is defined from 6d axion-electrodynamics with a 1-form Chern-Weil(CW) symmetry gauged dynamically. The gauging leads to a Green-Schwarz-West-Sagnotti(GSWS) term, which gives rise to an anomaly through a GSWS transformation acting on the 2-form gauge field. We cancel this anomaly by gauging a 3-form CW symmetry in 6d axion-electrodynamics. We find out the global symmetries in the resultant model and derive the gauge invariant action in the presence of the background gauge fields. It is argued that a discrete 1-form symmetry is anomalous because turning on the associated background gauge field causes quantum inconsistency due to an operator-valued ambiguity. Higher-group structure in this model that is manifested as a Green-Schwarz-like transformation for CW background gauge fields is discussed.</description>

Abstract: The Robinson-Trautman solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system admits a shear-free and twist-free null geodesic congruence with a nonvanishing expansion. Restricting to the case where the Maxwell field is aligned, i.e., the spacetime is algebraically special, we provide an exhaustive classification of supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity. The differential constraints that arise from the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equation enable us to systematically reconstruct the metric. We derive the explicit form of the Killing spinor either by directly integrating the Killing spinor equation or by casting the solution into the canonical form of supersymmetric solutions given in hep-th/0307022. In any case, the supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman solution generically exhibits a naked singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

Abstract: We consider heterotic string theories in nine and eight dimensions. We identify the disconnected part of the spacetime gauge group by studying the outer automorphism of the charge lattices. The absence of the global symmetry indicates the existence of non-supersymmetric codimension two branes. Moreover, we provide a list of gauge groups and matter contents of non-supersymmetric rank-reduced heterotic string theories (a branch corresponding to the $E_8$ string on $S^1$) from the orbifolding of the outer automorphism as well as the fermion parity. We also provide examples in eight dimensions.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06606v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Slow Roll Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new classes of inflation models based on the modular symmetry, where the modulus field $\tau$ serves as the inflaton. We establish a connection between modular inflation and modular stabilization, wherein the modulus field rolls towards a fixed point along the boundary of the fundamental domain. We find the modular symmetry strongly constrain the possible shape of the potential and identify some parameter space where the inflation predictions agree with cosmic microwave background observations. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be smaller than $10^{-6}$ in our models, while the running of spectral index is of the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Strings or Seeds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of QCD axion strings in the cosmological history of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking, focussing on the minimal KSVZ axion model. We consider the case of the pure SM Higgs potential as well as a simple scenario with a first order EW phase transition. We capture the effect of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) sector within an effective-theory approach for the Higgs field, where the axion string core and the heavy PQ states are integrated out. The relevant parameters in this effective theory are controlled by the size of the portal coupling between the Higgs and the PQ scalar, and the mass of the PQ radial excitation. We determine the range of portal couplings for which the axion strings can strongly affect the dynamics of EW symmetry breaking. In the case of a first order EW phase transition, the strings can act as seeds by either catalyzing the nucleation of (non-spherical) bubbles, or leading to the completion of the phase transition by triggering a classical instability.</description>

      <title>Yangian for cotangent Lie algebras and spectral $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a canonical quantization of Lie bialgebra structures on the formal power series $\mathfrak{d}[\![t]\!]$ with coefficients in the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d} = T^*\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g} \ltimes \mathfrak{g}^*$ to a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that these quantizations produce twists to the natural analog of the Yangian for $\mathfrak{d}$. Moreover, we construct spectral $R$-matrices for these twisted Yangians as compositions of twisting matrices.
  The motivation for the construction of these twisted Yangians over $\mathfrak{d}$ comes from certain 4d holomorphic-topological gauge theory. More precisely, we show that pertubative line operators in this theory can be realized as representations of these Yangians. Moreover, the comultiplications of these Yangians correspond to the monodial structure of the category of line operators.</description>

      <title>Managing Singular Kernels and Logarithmic Corrections in the Staggered Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of the staggered six-vertex model with ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetry for arbitrary system sizes $L$ using non-linear integral equations (NLIEs). Our study is motivated by two key questions: what is the accuracy of results based on the ODE/IQFT correspondence in the asymptotic regime of large system sizes, and what is the optimal approach based on NLIE for analyzing the staggered six-vertex model?
  We demonstrate that the quantization conditions for low-lying primary and descendant states, derived from the ODE/IQFT approach in the scaling limit, are impressively accurate even for relatively small system sizes. Specifically, in the anisotropy parameter range $\pi/4 &lt; \gamma &lt; \pi/2$, the difference between NLIE and ODE/IQFT results for energy and quasi-momentum eigenvalues is of order $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2})$.
  Furthermore, we present a unifying framework for NLIEs, distinguishing between versions with singular and regular kernels. We provide a compact derivation of NLIE with a singular kernel, followed by an equivalent set with a regular kernel. We address the stability issues in numerical treatments and offer solutions to achieve high-accuracy results, validating our approach for system sizes ranging from $L=2$ to $L=10^{24}$.
  Our findings not only validate the ODE/IQFT approach for finite system sizes but also enhance the understanding of NLIEs in the context of the staggered six-vertex model. We hope the insights gained from this study have significant implications for resolving the spectral problem of other lattice systems with emergent non-compact degrees of freedom and provide a foundation for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>The Third Structure Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-consider the graviton self-energy induced by a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars on de Sitter background. On flat space background it can be represented as a sum of two tensor differential operators acting on scalar structure functions. On a general background these tensor differential operators can be constructed from the linearized Ricci scalar and the linearized Weyl tensor. However, in cosmology one requires a third contribution which we derive here.</description>

      <title>A theory of time based on wavefunction collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Superconducting strings in the two-Higgs doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present superconducting vortex solutions in the two-Higgs doublet model which has a gauged $U(1)$ Higgs-family symmetry. We write down an ansatz for the solution and study its basic properties, for the case of both global and gauged symmetries. We demonstrate its prima-facie stability using 3D numerical simulations of a global version of the theory, observing the flow of current along the string. We discuss how generic such a phenomena might be and the possible consequences if such a model is found in nature.</description>
