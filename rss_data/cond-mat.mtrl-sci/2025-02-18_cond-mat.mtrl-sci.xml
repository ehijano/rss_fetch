      <title>Incorporation of physics-based strengthening coefficients into phenomenological crystal plasticity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efforts associated with parametrization of continuum-based models for crystal plasticity are a significant obstacle for the routine use of these models in materials science and engineering. While phenomenological constitutive descriptions are attractive due to their small number of adjustable parameters, the lack of physical meaning of their parameters counteracts this advantage to some extent. This study shows that interaction/strengthening coefficients determined with the help of discrete dislocation dynamics simulations for use in physics-based formulations can also be used to improve the predictive quality of phenomenological models. Since the values of these parameters have been determined for most technologically relevant materials, the findings enable to improve the parametrization of phenomenological crystal plasticity models at no costs.</description>

      <title>Si-compatible topological and infrared materials: the promise of Low-Sn GeSn digital alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, GeSn alloys have attracted much interest for direct-gap infrared photonics and as potential topological materials which are compatible with the semiconductor industry. However, for photonics, the high-Sn content required leads to low detectivity, associated with poor material quality, and the (&gt;35%) Sn required for topological properties have been out of reach experimentally. Here, we demonstrate that by patterning the Sn distribution within Ge, the electronic properties have a far greater tunability than is possible with the random alloy. For the GeSn \delta-digital alloy (DA) formed by confining Sn atoms in atomic layer(s) along the [111] direction of Ge, we show that ~10% Sn can lead to a triple-point semimetal. These findings are understood in terms of Sn ordering causing spatial separation of Sn and Ge band edges, leading to band inversion. This mechanism can also lead to a weak topological insulator, Weyl semimetal, and enables tunable direct bandgaps down to 2 meV, covering the entire infrared range. Our findings are generally applicable to other semiconductors DAs and point to a new class of currently unexplored topological systems accessible by epitaxy and establish the promise of low-Sn GeSn DAs for application as infrared laser diodes and photodetectors in Si photonic integrated circuits and infrared image sensors.</description>

      <title>Controlling phase selection, preferred orientation and epitaxy in molybdenum oxide films on mica and sapphire with oxygen content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum oxide films are attractive for diverse applications due to properties offered by multiple phases and polymorphs, which also makes exclusive synthesis of desired phases a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen flow ratio pO2 is key to phase selection, the type and extent of preferred orientation and epitaxy. Exclusive formation of non-layered monoclinic MoO2 crystals is supported on both mica and sapphire substrates at 500 {\deg}C within much of the 0.1 \le pO2 \le 0.25 range, outside which the films are amorphous. At 400 {\deg}C, the behavior is qualitatively similar, except for layered orthorhombic MoO3 formation at high pO2 and greater sensitivity of phase selection to pO2 due to the presence of a larger number of other phases. Increasing the pO2 tends to enhance preferred orientation and epitaxy, with fine-grained petal-like microstructure forming at low pO2, and large thin-sheeted crystals for at high pO2; however, MoO2 grows epitaxially on both f-mica and c-sapphire substrates while layered \alpha-MoO3 grows epitaxially on f- mica but not on sapphire These findings should facilitate the rationale synthesis of MoOx thin films with control over preferred orientation and microstructure to access and tune properties for applications. The research highlights the critical role of control over deposition parameters in tailoring the properties of MoOx films for applications such as electrochromic coatings and gas sensing.</description>

      <title>van der Waals epitaxy of {\alpha}-MoO3 films on f-mica by pulsed sputter deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the growth characteristics and structural properties of {\alpha}-MoO3 thin films with thicknesses ranging from 2.5 to 160 nm, deposited on f-mica and c-sapphire substrates at 400 {\deg}C. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the films are predominantly orthorhombic {\alpha}-MoO3 with a preferred 0k0 orientation along the out-of-plane direction on both substrates. The d-spacing for the 060 reflection shows a slight reduction with increased thickness, particularly on f-mica, which suggests minimal out-of-plane strain in the film and a stabilization of lattice parametes over larger thicknesses. Furthermore, full-width at half maximum measurements indicate improved stacking and crystal quality on f-mica compared to c-sapphire. The films on f-mica exhibit epitaxial growth with specific orientation relationships, while films on c-sapphire display a fiber texture. The near- thickness-independent nature of the peak positions on f-mica suggests stable lattice parameters and reduced strain accumulation, could be attributed to the van der Waals epitaxy. These results highlight the role of substrate choice in {\alpha}-MoO3 film growth and minimizing strain, providing valuable insights into the tuning of thin-film properties.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Large Hole Polarons in BiVO4-Implications for Photocatalysis and Solar Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4 BVO) is a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion, but its efficiency is limited by small polaron formation. However, some physical properties of BVO deviate from typical small polaron behavior. Using the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that BVO forms a quasi-large hole polaron with a radius around 2 nm, resembling free carriers with high mobility. This polaron is stabilized primarily by acoustic phonon modes, creating a shallow trap state near the valence band maximum, which prolongs its lifetime. Simultaneously, it retains a redox potential comparable to that of free carriers. We propose that such large polarons explain the superior properties of BVO and other transition metal oxide photocatalysts. Tuning phonon modes to stabilize large polarons offers a promising strategy for designing materials with enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency.</description>

      <title>Analysis of adiabatic shear coupled to ductile fracture and melting in viscoplastic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material failure by adiabatic shear is analyzed in viscoplastic metals that can demonstrate up to three distinct softening mechanisms: thermal softening, ductile fracture, and melting. An analytical framework is constructed for studying simple shear deformation with superposed static pressure. A continuum power-law viscoplastic formulation is coupled to a ductile damage model and a solid-liquid phase transition model in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Criteria for localization to a band of infinite shear strain are discussed. An analytical-numerical method for determining the critical average shear strain for localization and commensurate stress decay is devised. Averaged results for a high-strength steel agree reasonably well with experimental dynamic torsion data. Calculations probe possible effects of ductile fracture and melting on shear banding, and vice-versa, including influences of cohesive energy, equilibrium melting temperature, and initial defects. A threshold energy density for localization onset is positively correlated to critical strain and inversely correlated to initial defect severity. Tensile pressure accelerates damage softening and increases defect sensitivity, promoting shear failure. In the present steel, melting is precluded by ductile fracture for loading conditions and material properties within realistic protocols. If heat conduction, fracture, and damage softening are artificially suppressed, melting is confined to a narrow region in the core of the band.</description>

      <title>An attention-based neural ordinary differential equation framework for modeling inelastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To preserve strictly conservative behavior as well as model the variety of dissipative behavior dis- played by solid materials, we propose a significant enhancement to the internal state variable-neural ordinary differential equation (ISV-NODE) framework. In this data-driven, physics-constrained modeling framework internal states are inferred rather than prescribed. The ISV-NODE consists of: (a) a stress model dependent, on observable deformation and inferred internal state, and (b) a model of the evolution of the internal states. The enhancements to ISV-NODE proposed in this work are multifold: (a) a partially input convex neural network stress potential provides polyconvexity in terms of observed strain and inferred state, and (b) an internal state flow model uses common latent features to inform novel attention-based gating and drives the flow of internal state only in dissipative regimes. We demonstrated that this architecture can accurately model dissipative and conservative behavior across an isotropic, isothermal elastic-viscoelastic-elastoplastic spectrum with three exemplars.</description>

      <title>Multi-Carrier Thermal Transport in Electronic and Energy Conversion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium multi-carrier thermal transport is essential for both scientific research and technological applications in electronic, spintronic, and energy conversion devices. This article reviews the fundamentals of phonon, electron, spin, and ion transport driven by temperature gradients in solid-state and soft condensed matters, and the microscopic interactions between energy/charge carriers that can be leveraged for manipulating electrical and thermal transport in energy conversion devices, such as electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon interaction, and ion-solvent interactions, etc. In coupled electron-phonon transport, we discuss the basics of electron-phonon interactions and their effects on phonon dynamics, thermalization, and nonequilibrium thermal transport. For the phonon-spin interaction, nonequilibrium transport formulation is introduced first, followed by the physics of spin thermoelectric effect and strategies to manipulate them. Contributions to thermal conductivity from magnons as heat carriers are also reviewed. For coupled transport of heat and ions/molecules, we highlight the importance of local molecular configurations that determine the magnitude of the electrochemical gradient, which is the key to improving the efficiency of low-grade heat energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast demagnetization dynamics of 4f antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ultrafast demagnetization dynamics of LnRh$_2$Si$_2$ (Ln $=$ Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho) antiferromagnets (AFM) after excitation by a laser pulse, using a combination of density functional theory and atomistic spin and spin-lattice dynamics simulations. First, we calculate the Heisenberg interactions using the magnetic force theorem and compare two approaches, where the $4f$ states of the rare earths are treated as frozen core states or as valence states with added correlation corrections. We find marked quantitative differences in terms of predicted Curie temperature for most of the systems, especially for those with large orbital moment of the rare earth cations. This can be attributed to the importance of indirect interactions of the $4f$ states through the Si states, which depend on the binding energy of the $4f$ states and coexists with RKKY-type interactions mediated by the conduction states. However, qualitatively, both approaches agree in terms of the predicted AFM ordering at low temperatures. In the second step, the atomistic dynamics simulations are combined with a heat-conserving two-temperature model, allowing for the calculation of spin and electronic temperatures during the magnetization dynamics simulations. Despite quite different demagnetization times, magnetization dynamics of all studied LnRh$_2$Si$_2$ AFM exhibit similar two-step behavior, in particular, the first fast drop followed by slower demagnetization. We observe that the demagnetization amplitude depends linearly on laser fluence for low fluences, which is in agreement with experimental observations. We also investigate the impact of lattice dynamics on ultrafast demagnetization using coupled atomistic spin-lattice dynamics simulations and a heat-conserving three-temperature model, which confirm linear dependence of magnetisation on laser fluence.</description>

      <title>Semiconducting behaviors at epitaxial Ca0.5TaO3 interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent phenomena take place in symmetry-breaking systems, notably the recently discovered two-dimensional electron gas and its tunable superconductivities near the KTaO3 interfaces. Here, we synthesized perovskite Ca0.5TaO3 films along both [001] and [111] orientations. Different from the KTaO3 system, Ca0.5TaO3 films show semiconducting behaviors when capped with LaAlO3 films in both [001] and [111] orientations. By growing films at higher temperatures, more oxygen vacancies can be introduced, and the carrier density can be tuned from ~ 1014 cm-2 to ~ 1016 cm-2. Another difference is that the superconducting transition temperature Tc in KTaO3 (111) increases linearly along with its carrier density, while the Ca0.5TaO3 (111) remains semiconducting when carrier density ranges from ~ 1014 cm-2 to ~ 1016 cm-2. Based on the density function theory calculation, Ca0.5TaO3 and KTaO3 show similar electronic band structures. According to the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we found heavy Sr diffusion from the substrate to the Ca0.5TaO3 layer, which may destroy the interfacial conductivity. Our work demonstrates that besides the oxygen vacancies, electronic transport is sensitive to the atomic intermixing near the interface in tantulates.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Softer Lattice Dynamics in Defect Engineered GeTe Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the low-temperature lattice dynamics in two GeTe crystals with varying Ge defect stoichiometry. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) of the as-cleaved ingots indicate that the orientation is mainly along the h0l direction. From the Raman spectra, a comparison of the linewidth variation with temperature for the in-plane (E-mode) vibrations reveals a subtle enhancement around 170 K for the less stoichiometric crystal, depicting a more anharmonic nature, via the 4-phonon scattering processes. Furthermore, a comparison of the out-of-plane A_T^1 mode indicates a sensitivity of a weaker Raman signal ( about 239 cm -1) from disordered GeTe4 tetrahedra that has adversely affected the mode dynamics in the less stoichiometric sample (S1). However, this weaker signal is not observed for the more stoichiometric sample (S2) below 200 K. The Machine Learned Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations performed to calculate the phonon spectral densities reveal that the heavier atom, Te dominate below 100 cm-1, while, the lighter Ge has more significant contribution above 100 cm-1. Thus, the change observed only in the 120 cm-1 (A_T^1) mode is justified by defects at the Ge sites. Specific heat capacity measurements are performed that show a broad hump near 14 K, when plotted as Cp/T^3 versus T indicative of a non-Debye nature. Hence, considering the two optical modes in the Raman spectra, a Debye and two-Einstein modes model is conceptualized to explain the low-temperature specific heat. These calculations reveal a softer bonding vis-a-vis lowering of Debye temperature in S1. Lower Einstein temperatures are also observed in S1, which is attributed to the easy activation of these localized modes that affect the harmonicity of the lattice. Finally, the low-temperature resistivity measurements reveal a reduction in the effective phonon frequency (w_e) through the estimation of Te.</description>

      <title>Understanding Magnesium Dissolution through Machine Learn-ing Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium alloys have become increasingly important for various potential industrial applications, especially in energy storage, due to their outstanding properties. However, a clear under-standing of the dissolution mechanism of magnesium in the most common aqueous environments re-mains a critical challenge, hindering the broader application of magnesium alloys. To address pending key controversies in magnesium alloys research, the atomic-scale hydrogen evolution process and dis-solution mechanism of magnesium were investigated by combining machine learning molecular dy-namics with density functional theory. These controversies include the presence of magnesium reaction intermediates, the formation of uni-positive Mg+, the specific reaction steps involved in hydrogen evo-lution and magnesium dissolution, and the generation and growth mechanisms of the surface films. The results indicate that the intermediate species in the magnesium dissolution process is solid-phase MgOH, which exhibits an MgO-like structure. The magnesium in MgOH is identified as the widely recognized uni-positive Mg+. The intermediate film is formed, consisting primarily of the MgOH phase with a small amount of MgO. This film grows inward by extending into the magnesium substrate. Un-der sufficient water availability, the film undergoes further oxidation to form Mg(OH)2. These findings highlight the critical role of the MgOH phase in the magnesium dissolution process, leading to the pro-posal of a dissolution model based on MgOH/MgO solid phases as intermediates. These insights deep-en the understanding of magnesium dissolution, pave the way for the development of more effective anti-corrosion strategies for magnesium alloys, and may also advance the utilization of magnesium in energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing catalyst activity of two-dimensional C$_4$N$_2$ through doping for the hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of pristine and doped C$_4$N$_2$ nanosheets as potential electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The pristine C$_{36}$N$_{18}$ nanosheets exhibit limited HER activity, primarily due to high positive Gibbs free energies ($&gt;$ 2.2 eV). To enhance catalytic performance, doping with B, Si, or P at the nitrogen site was explored. Among these systems, B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets exhibit the most promising catalytic activity, with a Gibbs free energy close to zero ($\approx$ -0.2 eV), indicating efficient hydrogen adsorption. Band structure, projected density of states, charge density, and Bader charge analyses reveal significant changes in the electronic environment due to doping. While stacking configurations (AA$'$A$''$ and ABC) have minimal effect on catalytic performance, doping - particularly with B -substantially alters the electronic structure, optimizing hydrogen adsorption and facilitating efficient HER. These findings suggest that B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets could serve as efficient cocatalysts when combined with metallic materials, offering a promising approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications.</description>

Abstract: We visualize the topological ladder and band inversions in PtTe$_2$ using spin-polarized photoemission spectroscopy augmented by three-dimensional momentum imaging. This approach enables the detection of spin polarization in dispersive bands and provides access to topological properties beyond the reach of conventional methods. Extensive mapping of spin-momentum space reveals distinct topological surface states, including a surface Dirac cone at the binding energy $E_B \sim 2.3$ eV and additional states at $E_B \sim 1.6$ eV, $E_B \sim 1.0$ eV, and near the Fermi level. The electronic structure analysis demonstrates strong hybridization between Pt and Te atomic orbitals, confirming the nontrivial topology of these surface states. Furthermore, by comparison to one-step model photoemission calculations, we identify a robust correlation between the initial-state and measured spin polarizations while revealing asymmetries in specific experimental spin textures. These asymmetries, absent in the initial states due to symmetry constraints, arise from the breaking of time-reversal symmetry during the photoemission process, emphasizing the crucial influence of symmetries on experimental signatures of topology.</description>

      <title>Dimension Effect of Nanocarbon Precursors on Diamond Synthesis and Transformation Mechanism under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond holds significant promise for a wide range of applications due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. Investigating the controlled diamond preparation from nanocarbon precursors with varying dimensions is crucial to optimize the transition conditions and even elucidate the daunting transformation mechanism, however, this remains outstanding challenge despite considerable effort. Herein, we report the imperative dimension effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and physical mechanism under high temperature and high pressure, by comparing the distinct transition processes of zero-dimensional (0D) carbon nanocages (CNCs) and one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from conventional graphite. The optical and structural characterizations evidently demonstrated that both 0D CNCs and 1D CNTs first undergo collapse and graphitization, followed by the formation of mixed amorphous carbon with embedded diamond clusters, eventually leading to cubic diamond. The plotted pressure-temperature diagram exhibits the unique dimension effect of carbon nanomaterials to diamond transformation. These results provide valuable insights into the phase transition mechanisms of diamond synthesis and its derivatives under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Schottky-barrier-height in high-symmetry 2D WSe$_2$: Momentum-space anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show significant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy in k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone have different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we construct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D metal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of these two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit p-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different (of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are different along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space. There are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different interface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a difference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation of ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So, high-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in momentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work extends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high real-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for anisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of 2D material devices via controlling transport directions.</description>

      <title>Electrothermal manipulation of current-induced phase transitions in ferrimagnetic Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions driven by external stimuli are central to condensed matter physics, providing critical insights into symmetry breaking and emergent phenomena. Recently, ferrimagnetic (FiM) Mn3Si2Te6 has attracted considerable attention for its magnetic-field-induced insulator-metal transitions (IMTs) and unconventional current-driven phase transitions, yet the role of applied currents in the magnetic phase remains poorly understood. Here, by combining local magnetization probes and time-resolved transport measurements, we uncover an electrothermal origin for the current-induced first-order-like phase transitions, characterized by abrupt voltage jumps and distinct magnetic domain evolution. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics measured under triangular waveforms exhibit strong non- reciprocal and hysteretic behaviors, which are significantly suppressed at frequencies ~1000 Hz. Time-resolved studies using rectangular pulsed currents demonstrate that the resistance dynamics closely mirror the equilibrium resistance-temperature profile, directly implicating Joule heating as the driving mechanism. Furthermore, we reveal that the intrinsic I-V response adheres to Ohm's law, displaying linearity across various magnetic fields and temperatures. Our work advocates for a cautious approach in distinguishing between genuine current-induced nonequilibrium quantum states and thermal effects.</description>

      <title>Spin-chirality-driven second-harmonic generation in two-dimensional magnet CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and light can create abundant optical phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of an unconventional magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) stemming from vector spin chirality, denoted as chiral second-harmonic generation (SHG). Taking the antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr bilayer as a prototype, we theoretically show that, via spin canting, the chiral SHG can be continuously tuned from zero to a value one order of magnitude larger than its intrinsic MSHG. Remarkably, chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the N\'eel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a unique SHG with exceptional tunability but also promotes the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection techniques.</description>

      <title>Charge Orders in Fully Intercalated Bilayer TaSe$_2$: Dependence on Interlayer Stacking and Intercalation Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful technique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely controllable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase diagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the self-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the interplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated bilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated experimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the suppression of an intrinsic $3\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent TaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\times 2$, $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$, or the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer stacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the $2\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level compared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of typical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in these Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures comparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit coupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while simultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two competing effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across different Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that magnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying physics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for studying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.</description>

      <title>Correlative and in situ microscopy investigation of phase transformation, crystal growth and degradation of antimony sulfide thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimony sulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$), a compound of earth-abundant elements with highly anisotropic, quasi-layered crystal structure, triggered growing interest as a solar absorber in photovoltaics and as a phase change material in memory devices, yet challenges remain in achieving high-quality thin films with controlled nucleation and growth for optimal performance. Here, we investigate the phase transformation, crystal structure and properties, growth and degradation of atomic layer deposited Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films using in situ TEM and correlative ex situ analysis. The as-deposited amorphous films crystallized at 243{\deg}C, forming grains with an [100] out-of-plane texture and developed into tens to hundreds of micrometer, leaves-shaped grains. Introducing an ultra-thin ZnS interfacial layer increased nucleation density, and resulted in a few micrometer-sized, more uniform grains while retaining the overall [100] texture. In situ observations and subsequent crystal orientation analysis with cutting-edge 4D-STEM and EBSD revealed that the grains grew faster along the [010] ribbon direction and that the bare films underwent early-stage degradation, forming holes in amorphous regions during annealing. The ZnS interlayer mitigated degradation, stabilizing the films and improving their uniformity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films for applications both as solar cell materials and phase change materials.</description>

      <title>3D Electron Diffraction as GIWAXS Alternative for Quantitative Structural Characterization of Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate elastically filtered 3D Electron Diffraction (3D ED) as a powerful alternative technique to Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) for quantitatively characterizing the structure of organic semiconductor films. Using a model material system of solvent vapor annealed DRCN5T:PC71BM thin film, which is employed in organic solar cells (OSCs), we extract the structural data obtained from 3D ED and compare with that from GIWAXS, utilizing both laboratory and synchrotron X-ray sources. Quantitative evaluation of the datasets in terms of peak positions, peak widths and mosaicity revealed good agreement between both techniques, qualifying 3D ED as an alternative tool for analyzing highly beam-sensitive organic thin films. Furthermore, the respective advantages and limitations of 3D ED and GIWAXS are discussed, emphasizing the unique capability of 3D ED to integrate seamlessly with the diverse imaging and spectroscopic modalities in modern TEM. This integration enriches the techniques of structural characterization of OSCs, paving the way for deeper insights into their structural properties and ultimately their performance.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Classification for Constraint-Aware Alloy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alloy design can be framed as a constraint-satisfaction problem. Building on previous methodologies, we propose equipping Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPCs) with physics-informed prior mean functions to model the boundaries of feasible design spaces. Through three case studies, we highlight the utility of informative priors for handling constraints on continuous and categorical properties. (1) Phase Stability: By incorporating CALPHAD predictions as priors for solid-solution phase stability, we enhance model validation using a publicly available XRD dataset. (2) Phase Stability Prediction Refinement: We demonstrate an in silico active learning approach to efficiently correct phase diagrams. (3) Continuous Property Thresholds: By embedding priors into continuous property models, we accelerate the discovery of alloys meeting specific property thresholds via active learning. In each case, integrating physics-based insights into the classification framework substantially improved model performance, demonstrating an efficient strategy for constraint-aware alloy design.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced twist and untwist of moir\'{e} superlattices in TMDC heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional twisted bilayer moir\'e structures provide a versatile material platform for realizing a rich variety of strongly correlated electronic quantum phases intricately coupled with the periodically modulated lattice structures. In this work, we use ultrafast electron diffraction to directly reveal the photoinduced dynamic evolution of the moir\'e superlattice in $2^\circ$ and $57^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers. Upon above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moir\'e superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, accompanied by a collective lattice excitation of a moir\'e phonon mode with sub-THz frequency. This unique response deviates markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating, and suggests dynamic twisting and untwisting of the local moir\'e chiral structure. We infer large oscillations in the local twist angle, approaching $1^\circ$ peak to trough, that are driven by ultrafast charge carrier excitation and relaxation -- a phenomenon further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest a novel approach for real-time dynamic reconfiguration of moire superlattices to achieve ultrafast modulation of their strongly correlated behaviors.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of Magnetic Behaviour in Ni-Adsorbed Nb2C-OF MXene using Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic 2D materials have achieved significantly consideration owing to their encouraging applications. A variation of these 2D materials by occurrence of defects, by the transition-metal doping or adsorption or by the surface functionalization can initiate both the spin-polarization and magnetic properties in these materials. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to determine the electric, magnetic properties along with the electronic structures and stability of synthesized two-dimensional materials. This work describes the magnetic properties of Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF MXene. The study focuses on the computational approach based first principal calculation providing insight onto the magnetic properties of adsorbed compound and comparing it with pristine Nb2C-OF MXene. The pristine Nb2C-OF and Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF structures are simulated and optimized using Wien2k software. Using exchange-correlational functionals; spin-GGA and spin-GGA+U (for Nickel U= 6eV), Ni-ad-Nb2C-OF electronic band structure is found to be metallic having magnetic moment calculated +1.01516{\mu}_\b{eta} showing its non-superconducting and ferromagnetic behaviour. Owing to this magnetic nature, this 2D compound can be used for new upcoming applications such as spintronics and nano magnetic data storage devices.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Super-Resolution EBSD for Measurements of Relative Deformation Gradient Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize a data analysis approach for electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) which uses high-resolution Kikuchi pattern simulations to measure isochoric relative deformation gradient tensors from experimentally measured Kikuchi patterns of relatively low resolution. Simulation-based supersampling of the theoretical test diffraction patterns enables a significant precision improvement of tensor parameters obtained in best-fit determinations of strains and orientations from low-resolution experimental patterns. As an application, we demonstrate high-resolution orientation and strain analysis for the model case of hardness test indents on a Si(100) wafer, using Kikuchi patterns of variable resolution. The approach shows noise levels near $1 \times 10^{-4}$ in the relative deviatoric strain norm and in the relative rotation angles on nominally strain-free regions of the silicon wafer. The strain and rotation measurements are interpreted by finite element simulations. While confirming the basic findings of previously published studies, the present approach enables a potential reduction in the necessary pattern data size by about two orders of magnitude. We estimate that pattern resolutions in the order of $256\times256$ pixels should be enough to solve a majority of EBSD analysis tasks using pattern matching techniques.</description>

      <title>Phase-change materials for volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator and charge density wave transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and non-linear behaviors. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behavior and thus hold great potential for realizing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of neuronal oscillator devices based on three archetypal electronic phase-change materials: the correlated oxide VO2, the charge density wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progress from the perspective of materials development, including structural phase transitions, synthesis methods, electrical properties, and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>New insights into crystallographic relation and lattice dynamics effects in {CdO/MgO} superlattices grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the structural properties of molecular beam epitaxy grown {CdO/MgO} superlattices on sapphire substrates of different crystallographic orientations (a-, c-, r-, and m-plane). The investigations involve a comprehensive analysis using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution X-ray diffraction studies unveil a significant influence of surface symmetry on both the substrates and the epitaxial layers, particularly with respect to the occurrence of twins in the superlattices. Remarkably, no twins are observed on r-oriented sapphire substrates, resulting in improved interface and crystallographic quality. The results of studies demonstrated in this work show that the growth rate of CdO sublayers within {CdO/MgO} superlattices is intricately dependent on the substrate orientation. Notably, the c-plane and m-plane sapphire substrates yielded thicker CdO sublayers, indicating comparable growth rates for these crystallographic orientations. Conversely, the a-plane and r-plane orientations seemed to favor a slower growth rate of CdO sublayers.</description>

      <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Ta2O5 with One Formula Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify a stable triclinic crystal structure of Ta2O5 (named as {\gamma}1-Ta2O5) at atmospheric pressure whose unit cell contains one formula unit (Z=1). Comparison with the Z=1 Ta2O5 structures from the Materials Project [APL Mater. 1, 011002 (2013)] reveals that {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 is energetically the most stable among the Z=1 Ta2O5 phases, and is the second most stable among all the Ta2O5 phases. Characterization of {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 is carried out by analyzing the X-ray powder diffraction patterns, the elastic, vibrational, thermal and electronic properties. The electronic structures of {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 are calculated using standard DFT as well as many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation. The results indicate that {\gamma}1-Ta2O5 is a wide band gap semiconductor with an indirect gap of ~ 3.361 eV.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling Enhanced Hydrogen Desorption from Graphene Surface: Atomic versus Molecular Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the desorption mechanism of hydrogen isotopes from graphene surface using first-principles calculations, with focus on the effects of quantum tunneling. At low temperatures, quantum tunneling plays a dominant role in the desorption process of both hydrogen monomers and dimers. In the case of dimer desorption, two types of mechanisms, namely the traditional one-step desorption in the form of molecules (molecular mechanism), and the two-step desorption in the form of individual atoms (atomic mechanism) are studied and compared. For the ortho-dimers, the dominant desorption mechanism is found to switch from the molecular mechanism to the atomic mechanism above a critical temperature, which is respectively ~ 300 K and 200 K for H and D.</description>

      <title>Surface magnetoelectric driven spin dynamics in metallic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although magnetoelectric effects in metals are usually neglected, assuming that applied electric fields are screened by free charge carriers, the skin depth, defining the penetration depth of the fields, is non-zero and for THz electric fields typically reaches 400 nm. Hence, if the thickness of an antiferromagnetic film is of the order of tens of nm, electric field induced effects cannot be neglected. Here, we theoretically study the THz electric field induced spin dynamics in the metallic antiferromagnets $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$ and $\mathrm{CuMnAs}$, whose spin arrangements allow them to exhibit a linear magnetoelectric effect. We shown that the THz magnetoelectric torque in metallic antiferromagnets is proportional to the time derivative of the THz electric field induced polarization. Our simulations reveal that the magnetoelectric driven spin dynamics is indeed not negligible and can fairly explain the previously published experimental results on antiferromagnetic dynamics excited by the THz pump pulses in $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$ at the corresponding magnetoelectric susceptibility value $\alpha_{\mathrm{ME}} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-5}$ without involving other mechanisms. This value is about one order of magnitude smaller than that known for collinear and rare-earth-free antiferromagnets such as $\mathrm{Cr}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$. For such a value of magnetoelectric response, it appears that the THz electric fields of realistic strengths of about 1 MV/cm are sufficient in order to achieve spin dynamics with the amplitudes sufficiently strong enough for switching of the antiferromagnetic N\'eel vector between the stable ground states. Thus, we contend that the experimental studies of the coherent dynamics of the antiferromagnetic N\'eel vector driven by the THz pulses in magnetoelectric metal films necessitate a careful consideration of the linear magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Exploring Novel 2D Analogues of Goldene: Electronic, Mechanical, and Optical Properties of Silverene and Copperene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad application potential. Building on the success of goldene, a monolayer lattice of gold atoms, we explore its proposed silver and copper analogs, silverene and copperene, using density functional theory calculations. Our findings reveal that silverene and copperene are energetically stable, with formation energies of -2.3 eV/atom and -3.1 eV/atom, closely matching goldene's -2.9 eV/atom. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their structural and dynamical stability at room temperature, showing no bond breaking or structural reconfiguration. Mechanical analyses indicate isotropy, with Young's moduli of 73 N/m, 44 N/m, and 59 N/m for goldene, silverene, and copperene, respectively, alongside Poisson's ratios of 0.46, 0.42, and 0.41. These results suggest comparable rigidity and deformation characteristics. Electronic band structure analysis highlights their metallic nature, with variations in the band profiles at negative energy levels. Despite their metallic character, these materials exhibit optical properties akin to semiconductors, pointing to potential applications in optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of radiation-induced damage in nuclear graphite - a comparative structural and microstructural study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphite, as a material for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR), will be exposed to harsh environment. The stability of graphite structure under irradiation is of a key importance for efficiency, reliability and security of the Generation IV nuclear reactors. Three types of nuclear grade graphite were subjected to irradiation in this research - two commercially manufactured (IG-110 and NBG-17) and the laboratory's in-home material (NCBJ). The samples were exposed to 150 keV Ar+ and He+ ions bombardment at 400 C with fluences ranging from 1E12 to 2E17 ion/cm2 in order to simulate in-reactor conditions. For analysis of the level of structure damage, type of created defects and crystallite size changes under ion irradiation ex-situ Raman spectroscopy was used. The methodology of spectra fitting was developed. Furthermore, SEM observation of irradiated materials was performed. Results showed structural degradation of materials by the means of amorphisation: slight at a low fluence level, rising rapidly at higher irradiation values. Furthermore, stronger structural disorder was found in the materials irradiated with heavier Ar+ ions than with lighter He+. Microstructural evolution of the nuclear graphites aligned with the structural deterioration in its stepwise character.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the atomic structure of substitutional platinum dopants in MoS$_2$ with single-sideband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We substitute individual Pt atoms into monolayer MoS$_2$ and study the resulting atomic structures with single-sideband (SSB) ptychography supported by ab initio simulations. We demonstrate that while high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging provides excellent Z-contrast, distinguishing some defect types such as single and double sulfur vacancies remains challenging due to their low relative contrast difference. However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Weyl and Dirac Semimetals for Thermoelectric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl and Dirac semimetals, characterized by their unique band structures with linear energy dispersion (E vs k) near the Fermi level (EF), have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation technology based on thermoelectric materials. Their exceptional electronic properties, notably high carrier mobility and substantial Berry curvature, offer the potential to surmount the limitations inherent in conventional thermoelectric materials. A comprehensive understanding of the fundamental physics underlying these materials is essential. This chapter mainly focused into the topological properties and distinctive electronic band structures of Weyl and Dirac semimetals, providing a theoretical framework for comprehending their thermoelectric transport properties such as Seebeck coefficients, electrical and thermal conductivity. The pivotal role of Berry curvature in enhancing Seebeck coefficients while reducing thermal conductivity is a key focus. Experimental advancements in synthesizing single crystals and characterizing these materials have been significant. Recent development in material growth and characterization techniques have propelled research forward. The intricate relationship between material properties, such as carrier concentration, electronic bandgap, and crystal structure, and thermoelectric performance is explored. Realizing the potential of Weyl and Dirac semimetals for practical thermoelectric applications necessitates overcoming specific challenges. This chapter outlines strategies to optimize thermoelectric figures of merit (ZT) through band engineering, carrier doping, and nanostructuring. Moreover, the exploration of hybrid materials and heterostructures offers promising avenues for enhancing thermoelectric performance for renewable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Identification of Polytypism and Their Dislocations in Bilayer MoS2 Using Correlative Transmission Electron Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking orders and topological defects substantially influence the physical properties of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, the inherent features of 2D materials challenge the effectiveness of single characterization techniques in identifying stacking sequences, necessitating correlative approaches. Using bilayer MoS2 as a benchmark, we differentiate its polytypism and specific dislocations through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Perfect and partial dislocations were revealed in TEM, which are closely linked to the stacking sequences, thus indirectly indicating the 2H and 3R polytypes. 3D electron diffraction reconstruction on relrods and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy further validated these polytypes owing to their reliance on crystal symmetry. Surprisingly, we unexpectedly resolved both polytypes despite starting with 2H bulk crystal, pointing to a possible phase transition during mechanical exfoliation. The correlative TEM-Raman approach can be extended to other 2D materials, paving the way for property alteration via stacking and defect engineering.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetoelastic stress in disordered iron-gallium alloy thin films revealed by direct measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.</description>

      <title>Review on thermoelectric properties of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered an advantageous alternative to their celebrated two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals akin compound, graphene, for a number of applications, especially those requiring a gapped and possibly tunable band structure. Thermoelectricity is one of the application fields where TMDs could indeed outperform graphene, thanks to their lower thermal conductivity, large effective masses, valley degeneracy, varied and tunable transport properties, as well as sensitivity of their band structures and phonon spectra to confinement. Yet, despite promising theoretical predictions, thermoelectric properties of TMDs have not been extensively investigated so far and a clear assessment of TMDs as viable thermoelectric materials, based on experimental results, is still missing. In this paper, we review the experimental findings of literature on thermoelectric properties of TMDs, to sort out the countless combinations of chemical compositions, doping, off-stoichiometry and sample forms which could potentially result in optimized and possibly competitive thermoelectric properties. Based on the experimental data of literature, we simulate the performance of an all-TMD thermoelectric device for practical application as a micron sized cryocooler or power generator.</description>

      <title>Irreversible multi-band effects and Lifshitz transitions at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface under field effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the irreversible effects of an applied electric field on the magnetotransport properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 conducting interfaces, with focus on their multiband character. We study samples of different types, namely with either crystalline or amorphous LaAlO3 overlayer. Our two-band analysis highlights the similarity of the electronic properties of crystalline and amorphous interfaces, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities. Furthermore, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns, at least in qualitative terms, in the two types of samples. In agreement with previous works on crystalline interfaces, we observe that an irreversible charge depletion takes place after application of a first positive back gate voltage step. Such charge depletion affects much more, in relative terms, the higher and three-dimensional dyz, dzx bands than the lower and bidimensional dxy, driving the system through the Lifshitz transition from two-band to single band behavior. The quantitative analysis of experimental data evidences the roles of disorder, apparent in the depletion regime, and temperature. Noteworthy, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns in crystalline and amorphous samples, at least in qualitative terms, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities.</description>

      <title>Resolving the sodiation process in hard carbon anodes with nanostructure specific X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard carbons show significant promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, monitoring the sodiation process in the hard carbon electrode during cycling and understanding the sodiation mechanism remain challenging. This article reports on operando 2D scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and ex situ 3D SAXS tomography of hard carbon electrodes during the sodiation process. Structural changes are monitored with spatial and temporal resolution during the electrochemical process and shows that sodiation through micropore filling is the more dominating mechanism in the later stages of sodiation, i.e. in the plateau region of the voltage profile, while intercalation occurs continuously. Spatial inhomogeneities are resolved over the electrode and reveal an increased level of inhomogeneity at higher degree of sodiation with regions of different degrees of micropore filling. Resolving the processes spatially enables us to correlate plating, starting from the interface between the electrode and the current collector, to a higher degree of micropore filling. The work demonstrates how SWAXS imaging can contribute to understanding the sodiation of hard carbon anodes, not only by spatially resolved analysis, but also as a method to decouple contributions from different components in a cell, enabling more accurate scattering analysis in in situ environments.</description>

      <title>Correlative X-ray and electron tomography for scale-bridging, quantitative analysis of complex, hierarchical particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive workflow for investigating particulate materials through combined 360{\deg} electron tomography (ET), nano-computed X-ray tomography (nanoCT), and micro-computed X-ray tomography (microCT), alongside a versatile sample preparation routine. The workflow enables the investigation of size, morphology, and pore systems across multiple scales, from individual particles to large hierarchical structures. A customized tapered sample shape is fabricated using focused ion beam milling with the aim to optimize each imaging technique's field of view, facilitating high-resolution analysis of small volumes containing single particles, while also allowing for large-scale studies of thousands of particles for statistical relevance. By correlating data from same locations in different imaging modalities, the approach enhances the precision of quantitative analyses. The study highlights the importance of cross-scale, correlative three-dimensional microscopy for a comprehensive understanding of complex hierarchical materials. Precise data registration, segmentation using machine learning, and multimodal imaging techniques are crucial for unlocking insights into process-structure-property relationships and thus to optimize functional, hierarchical materials.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Control of the Speed of Light Using Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate nonreciprocal control of the speed of light by sending a microwave pulse through a cavity magnonics device. In contrast to reciprocal group velocity controlled by conventional electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect, incorporating dissipative magnon-photon coupling establishes a non-reciprocal EIT effect, allowing slow and fast light propagation in opposite directions at the same frequency with comparable amplitude. Remarkably, reversing the magnetic field enables a directional switch between non-reciprocal fast and slow light. This discovery may offer new possibilities for pulse time regulation in microwave signal communications, neuromorphic computing, and quantum signal processing.</description>

      <title>Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability of Skyrmion Tubes in Nanostructured Cuboids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in bulk materials are typically regarded as two-dimensional structures. However, they also exhibit three-dimensional configurations, known as skyrmion tubes, which elongate and extend in-depth. Understanding the configurations and stabilization mechanism of skyrmion tubes is crucial for the development of advanced spintronic devices. However, the generation and annihilation of skyrmion tubes in confined geometries are still rarely reported. Here, we present direct imaging of skyrmion tubes in nanostructured cuboids of a chiral magnet FeGe using Lorentz transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), while applying an in-plane magnetic field. It is observed that skyrmion tubes stabilize in a narrow field-temperature region near the Curie temperature (Tc). Through a field cooling process, metastable skyrmion tubes can exist in a larger region of the field-temperature diagram. Combining these experimental findings with micromagnetic simulations, we attribute these phenomena to energy differences and thermal fluctuations. Our results could promote topological spintronic devices based on skyrmion tubes.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission medium to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Characterize Charge Transport and Hysteresis in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology, already achieving efficiencies surpassing 25%. However, effects such as hysteresis are commonly observed due to the interplay of ionic and electronic transport occurring over different timescales. Despite the widespread use of impedance spectroscopy (IS), physical interpretation in PSCs is specially challenging due to memory effects. In this study, we focus on integrating experimental data with an analytical device transport model. The PSCs under investigation were fabricated using a Cs$_{0.17}$FA$_{0.83}$Pb(I$_{0.83}$Br$_{0.17}$)$_3$ active layer between Nb$_2$O$_5$/TiO$_2$ (compact/mesoporous) and Spiro-OMeTAD. Our fully analytical charge transport model incorporates independent charge transport channels, enabling the correlation of experimental observations in both dark and under illumination. We employed IS together with various voltammetry techniques to reveal the dynamics of the transport processes, including voltage pulses and both small and large amplitude sinusoidal excitations. Although small perturbations are commonly used in IS, our findings demonstrate that large sinusoidal excitation provides new valuable insights in the transition from capacitive to inductive-like responses. The proposed model based purely on charge trapping and generation effectively captures device behavior under both small and large voltages without inductive elements, validated through accurate simulations of hysteresis and other electrical phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Vendiscope: An Algorithmic Microscope For Data Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th century, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the microscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures and phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the need for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of complex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first algorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to computational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family of differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics -- and assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall diversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis at scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine learning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein universe, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that AlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute most to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database led to similar findings: more than $85\%$ of the crystals with formation energy data are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance diversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as memorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized training samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the best-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least to diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a powerful tool for data-driven science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin MoSe2 is a promising platform for investigating quantum phenomena due to its large effective mass, high crystal quality, and strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we demonstrate a triple-gate device design with bismuth contacts, enabling reliable ohmic contact down to low electron densities, with a maximum Hall mobility of approximately 22,000 cm2/Vs. Low-temperature transport measurements illustrate metal-insulator transitions, and density-dependent quantum oscillation sequences. Enhanced spin susceptibility and density-dependent effective mass are observed, attributed to interaction effects and valley polarization. These findings establish monolayer MoSe2 as a versatile platform for further exploring interaction-driven quantum states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ti-based two-dimensional transition-metal carbides (MXenes) have attracted attention due to their superior properties and are being explored across various applications1,2. Despite their versatile properties, superconductivity has never been demonstrated, not even predicted, for this important group of 2D materials. In this work, we have introduced an electrochemical intercalation protocol to construct versatile organometallic-inorganic hybrid MXenes and achieved tunable superconductivity in the metallocene-modified layered crystals. Through structural editing of MXene matrix at atomic scale and meticulously modulated intercalation route, Ti3C2Tx intercalated with metallocene species exhibits a superconductive transition temperature (Tc) of 10.2 K. Guest intercalation induced electron filling and strain engineering are responsible for the emerging superconductivity in this intrinsically non-superconducting material. Theoretically, simulated electron-phonon interaction effects further elucidate the nature of the changes in Tc. Furthermore, the Tc of crafted artificial superlattices beyond Ti-based MXenes have been predicted, offering a general strategy for engineering superconductivity and magnetism in layered hybrid materials.</description>

      <title>Imaging current flow and injection in scalable graphene devices through NV-magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global electronic properties of solid-state devices are strongly affected by the microscopic spatial paths of charge carriers. Visualising these paths in novel devices produced by scalable processes would provide a quality assessment method that can propel the device performance metrics towards commercial use. Here, we use high-resolution nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry to visualise the charge flow in gold-contacted, single-layer graphene devices produced by scalable methods. Modulating the majority carrier type via field effect reveals a strong asymmetry between the spatial current distributions in the electron and hole regimes that we attribute to an inhomogeneous microscopic potential landscape, inaccessible to conventional measurement techniques. In addition, we observe large, unexpected, differences in charge flow through nominally identical gold-graphene contacts. Moreover, we find that the current transfer into the graphene occurs several microns before the metal contact edge. Our findings establish high-resolution NV-magnetometry as a key tool for characterizing scalable 2D material based devices, uncovering quality deficits of the material, substrate, and electrical contacts that are invisible to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</description>

      <title>Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</description>

      <title>Why is the strength of a polymer network so low?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments have long shown that a polymer network of covalent bonds commonly ruptures at a stress that is orders of magnitude lower than the strength of the covalent bonds. Here we investigate this large reduction in strength by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the network ruptures by sequentially breaking a small fraction of bonds, and that each broken bond lies on the minimum "shortest path". The shortest path is the path of the fewest bonds that connect two monomers at the opposite ends of the network. As the network is stretched, the minimum shortest path straightens and bears high tension set by covalent bonds, while most strands off the path deform by entropic elasticity. After a bond on the minimum shortest path breaks, the process repeats for the next minimum shortest path. As the network is stretched and bonds are broken, the scatter in lengths of the shortest paths first narrows, causing stress to rise, and then broadens, causing stress to decline. This sequential breaking of a small fraction of bonds causes the network to rupture at a stress that is orders of magnitude below the strength of the covalent bonds.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the charge-density-wave superlattice of 1$T$-TiSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of intriguing phenomena, including exciton condensation, orbital ordering, and emergence of chirality, have been proposed to accompany charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$. Explaining these effects relies on knowledge of the atomic displacement pattern underlying the CDW, yet structural proposals based on spatially-averaging bulk crystal diffraction and surface-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy have remained inconsistent. Here, we revisit the CDW superlattice structure with selected-area electron diffraction, a bulk-sensitive probe capable of capturing sub-micrometer spatial variations while maintaining high momentum resolution. We resolved two distinct, spatially separated CDW phases characterized by different interlayer ordering. In both phases, previously reported atomic displacement patterns fail to account for the observed extinction rules. Instead, our analysis reveals a new superlattice structure, which features a large number of nearly degenerate CDW domains. These findings not only provide a new basis for understanding the gyrotropic electronic order and metastability in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, they also underscore the importance of bulk-sensitive mesoscopic techniques in investigating materials that host unconventional superlattices.</description>

      <title>Exerting chemical pressure on the kagome lattice as frustration control in the kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$ forms a series of compounds, wherein the chemical pressure realized by the $A-$site cation tunes the spin exchange in the frustrated distorted kagome lattice. Via hydrothermal synthesis we have grown single crystals of the whole series for $A=$ rare-earths and found a clear structural transition to a superstructure variant at a specific chemical pressure level exerted by $A$~=~Dy. Phases with crystal structures in the vicinity of this superstructure transition realize a distorted kagome lattice of the Cu$^{2+}$ cations with characteristic features of a spin liquid. Here, subtle structural disorder as well as controlled chemical pressure can stabilize the spin liquid phase. We study the crystal structure and the magnetic ground state of these phases via single crystal x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and muon spin spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases arise as the parameters of a quantum system are varied as a function of time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependency can be removed and the Berry topological phase can be obtained from a trajectory on the parameter space. Although this approach is usually applied in solid-state physics without further reflection, in many cases, say in Dirac or Weyl materials, the adiabatic approximation is never met as many systems are gapless. Here it is shown how to use other time dependent defined topological quantities, in particular the Aharonov-Anandan phase that provides information not only about the topology but also about band transitions. Therefore, we analyze the problem of graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, demonstrating how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary information about the topology and interband transitions. This is achieved using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>Single-Molecule Water Motion on h-BN and Graphene: A Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Behaviour of Water on 2D Material Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding water behaviour on 2D materials is crucial for sensing, microfluidics, and tribology. While water/graphene interactions are well studied, water on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) remains largely unexplored. Despite structural similarity to graphene, h-BN's slightly polar B-N bonds impart a large band gap, high thermal conductivity, and chemical stability, making it promising for electronics, lubricants, and coatings. Moreover, existing water studies often focus on multilayer water dynamics, overlooking single-molecular details. We bridge this gap by studying single-molecular water friction and diffusion on h-BN, comparing it with graphene using helium spin-echo experiments and ab initio calculations. Our findings show that water diffusion on h-BN/Ni follows a complex rotational-translational dynamic, unlike graphene. While conventional views treat water motion as discrete jumps between equivalent adsorption sites, we demonstrate that on h-BN, water molecules rotate freely around their centre of mass. Although the binding energies of water on h-BN and graphene are similar, the activation energy for water dynamics on h-BN is 2.5 times lower than on graphene, implying a much lower barrier for molecular mobility. The fundamentally different diffusion characteristics which classical models cannot capture, underscores the need to rethink how we model water on polar 2D materials. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the metal substrate strongly influences water friction, with h-BN/Ni showing a markedly lower friction than graphene/Ni, in stark contrast to the free-standing materials. These findings challenge assumptions about 2D material-water interactions, highlighting the crucial role of substrate effects in chemistry and material science and offer insights for designing next-generation microfluidic devices that require precise water mobility control.</description>

      <title>A novel method to determine the layer number of 2D TMD materials based on Optical Microscopy and Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dicakcoganite (TMD) materials have unique electronic and optical properties. The electronic band structures of the materials alter as a function of layer numbers, which results in modifications to the whole characteristic properties. Therefore, the determination of the layer number is crucial for optoelectronic applications. In this study, a fast and easily applicable method is proposed for determining the layer number of two-dimensional TMD materials by using an optical microscopy and computatial methods. The method uses image processing techniques on digital images taken with a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera under a conventional reflecting microscope. The chromaticity differences and lightness difference in International Commission on Illumination (Commission internationale de ,CIE) Luv color space values between the layered areas on the flakes and substrates are used together to train the model to be identified the layer numbers of the materials and corrected via photoluminescence spectroscopy. The random forest clasifier algorithm is applied to predict layer numbers on unknown materials. This approach provides high accuracy under varying microscope configurations such as brightnesses, gain etc. and material-substrate combinations. From ML to bulk whole layers numbers of MoS2, WSe2 and WS2 flakes are determined with high accuracy by training only a single flake of each has various layer numbers. Compared with traditional methods such as Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL), our method is not only faster but also easier to apply. Moreover, unlike the prominent methods in the literature such as machine learning or clustering-based, it requires only single training for a material/substrate combination and further accelerates the processes.</description>

      <title>A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n&gt;4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.</description>

      <title>Nanoindentation of single crystalline Mo: Atomistic defect nucleation and thermomechanical stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanical responses of single crystalline Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) metals, such as molybdenum (Mo), outperform other metals at high temperatures, so much so that they are considered as excellent candidates for applications under extreme conditions, such as the divertor of fusion reactors. The excellent thermomechanical stability of molybdenum at high temperatures (400-1000$^{\rm o}$C) has also been detected through nanoindentation, pointing towards connections to emergent local dislocation mechanisms related to defect nucleation. In this work, we carry out a computational study of the effects of high temperature on the mechanical deformation properties of single crystalline Mo under nanoindentation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of spherical nanoindentation are performed at two indenter tip diameters and crystalline sample orientations [100], [110], and [111], for the temperature range of 10-1000K. We investigate how the increase of temperature influences the nanoindentation process, modifying dislocation densities, mechanisms, atomic displacements and also, hardness, in agreement with reported experimental measurements. Our results suggest that the characteristic formation and high-temperature stability of [001] dislocation junctions in Mo during nanoindentation, in contrast to other BCC metals, may be the cause of the persistent thermomechanical stability of Mo.</description>

      <title>Parameterizing empirical interatomic potentials for predicting thermophysical properties via an irreducible derivative approach: the case of ThO$_2$ and UO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of classical physical property predictions using molecular dynamics simulations is determined by the quality of the interatomic potentials. Here we introduce a training approach for empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs) which is well suited for capturing phonons and phonon-related properties. Our approach is based on direct comparisons of the second- and third-order irreducible derivatives between an EIP and the Born-Oppenheimer potential within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Irreducible derivatives fully exploit space group symmetry and allow for training without redundant information. We demonstrate the fidelity of our approach in the context of ThO$_2$ and UO$_2$, where we optimize parameters of an embedded-atom method potential in addition to core-shell interactions. Our EIPs provide thermophysical properties in good agreement with DFT and outperform widely utilized EIPs for phonon dispersion and thermal conductivity predictions. Reasonable estimates of thermal expansion and formation energies of Frenkel pairs are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Site-selective polar compensation of Mott electrons in a double perovskite heterointerface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double perovskite oxides (DPOs) with two transition metal ions ($A_2$$BB^\prime$O$_6$) offer a fascinating platform for exploring exotic physics and practical applications. Studying these DPOs as ultrathin epitaxial thin films on single crystalline substrates can add another dimension to engineering electronic, magnetic, and topological phenomena. Understanding the consequence of polarity mismatch between the substrate and the DPO would be the first step towards this broad goal. We investigate this by studying the interface between a prototypical insulating DPO Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and a wide-band gap insulator SrTiO$_3$. The interface is found to be insulating in nature. By combining several experimental techniques and density functional theory, we establish a site-selective charge compensation process that occurs explicitly at the Mn site of the film, leaving the Ni sites inert. We further demonstrate that such surprising selectivity, which cannot be explained by existing mechanisms of polarity compensation, is directly associated with their electronic correlation energy scales. This study establishes the crucial role of Mott physics in polar compensation process and paves the way for designer doping strategies in complex oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated photon-helicity-induced magnetization precession in Co$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$ alloy thin films. In addition to field-like torque, attributable to magnetic field generation owing to {\it the inverse Faraday effect}, we observed non-trivial and large damping-like torque which has never been discussed for single ferromagnetic layer. The composition dependence of those two torques is effectively elucidated by a model that considers mutual coupling via spin-orbit interaction between magnetization and the electronic orbital angular momentum generated by photon-helicity. This work significantly enhances our understanding of the physics relevant to the interplay of photon-helicity and magnetization in magnetic metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic data, particularly diffraction data, contain detailed crystal and microstructure information and thus are crucial for materials discovery. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are greatly effective in identifying crystals. Although machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced the analysis of powder XRD patterns, the progress is hindered by a lack of training data. To address this, we introduce SimXRD, the largest open-source simulated XRD pattern dataset so far, to accelerate the development of crystallographic informatics. SimXRD comprises 4,065,346 simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns, representing 119,569 distinct crystal structures under 33 simulated conditions that mimic real-world variations. We find that the crystal symmetry inherently follows a long-tailed distribution and evaluate 21 sequence learning models on SimXRD. The results indicate that existing neural networks struggle with low-frequency crystal classifications. The present work highlights the academic significance and the engineering novelty of simulated XRD patterns in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of novel quantum materials within ternary phase spaces containing antagonistic pair such as Fe with Bi, Pb, In, and Ag, presents significant challenges yet holds great potential. In this work, we investigate the stabilization of these immiscible pairs through the integration of Cerium (Ce), an abundant rare-earth and cost-effective element. By employing a machine learning (ML)-guided framework, particularly crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), combined with first-principles calculations, we efficiently explore the composition/structure space and predict 9 stable and 37 metastable Ce-Fe-X (X=Bi, Pb, In and Ag) ternary compounds. Our findings include the identification of multiple new stable and metastable phases, which are evaluated for their structural and energetic properties. These discoveries not only contribute to the advancement of quantum materials but also offer viable alternatives to critical rare earth elements, underscoring the importance of Ce-based intermetallic compounds in technological applications.</description>

      <title>A DFT+$U$+$V$ study of pristine and oxygen-deficient HfO$_2$ with self-consistent Hubbard parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics have emerged as promising materials for advanced nanoelectronics, with their robust polarization and silicon compatibility making them ideal for high-density, non-volatile memory applications. Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than $1\,\%$ error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), enabling the mapping of microstructures to mechanical responses using solely physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields, Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. SPiFOL achieves significantly higher speed-up factors compared to conventional FFT solvers.</description>

      <title>Growth of Large Area WSe2 and Observation of Photogenerated Inversion Layer in DMOS Configuration</title>

Abstract: Here, we report the full-fledged journey towards the material synthesis and characterization of few-layered/thin WSe$_2$ using sputtered W-films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates followed by electrical studies under dark and illumination conditions. Growth temperature 500oC and gas pressure 55 sccm are found to be the optimized parameters for formation of thermodynamically stable WSe$_{2-x}$ with dominant Raman peak at 265 cm-1. XRD and HR-TEM measurement clarify the formation of high crystallinity along the c-axis and quasi-crystallinity along a and b axes respectively. Lower intensities from Raman-measurement and PL-peak at 768 nm (with 532 nm excitation wavelength) infers the thin nature of the grown film, along with strong second harmonic emission with excitation wavelength varying from 350nm to 450 nm. This work also retracks the controlled etching by reactive ions to achieve large area bi/tri-layer films to fabricate advanced devices. We also have fabricated an advanced MOS structure on SiO$_2$/p-Si substrate which shows tremendous performance by means of photo-capacitance under illumination condition where photo-carriers can survive the higher probe frequencies (&gt; 1MHz). Under illumination condition, HfO$_2$/WSe$_2$ embedded MOS shows its dominance showing a huge electron-inversion region over HfO$_2$/ SiO$_2$/p-Si and SiO$_2$/p-Si MOS devices even at high frequencies (1-10 MHz). Thereby, this work also reveals a possible route for capacitance based highly sensitive photodetection using conventional Si-technology with integration of such WSe$_2$/W as an active material.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in Ca/Mn modified BaTiO3</title>

Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~44 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a methodology for in situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) tensile testing that enables nanoscale characterization of the evolution of complex plasticity mechanisms. By integrating a modified in situ scanning electron microscope nanoindenter with a microscale push-to-pull device and a conventional Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) detector, we achieved TKD measurements at high spatial resolution during mechanical deformation. A dedicated focused ion beam procedure was developed for site-specific specimen fabrication, including lift-out, thinning, and shaping into a dog-bone geometry. The methodology was demonstrated on two case studies: (i) a metastable $\beta$-Ti single crystal, on which we quantified the initiation and evolution of nanoscale twinning and stress-induced martensitic transformation, and (ii) a $CuAl/Al_2O_3$ nanolaminate, which showed nanoscale plasticity and twinning/detwinning in a complex microstructure. Overall, this approach provides a robust alternative to in situ EBSD and transmission electron microscopy testing, facilitating detailed analysis of deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature vacancy emission from the jog on edge dislocation in FCC nickel under glide force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jogs, atomic-scale steps on dislocations, play an important role in crystal plasticity, yet they are often ignored in discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations due to their small sizes. While jogs on screw dislocations are known to move non-conservatively (i.e. climb) accompanied by vacancy emission, jogs on edge dislocations are commonly expected to move conservatively (i.e. glide) with the dislocation under ambient conditions. Here we report unexpected findings from molecular dynamics simulations of an edge dislocation containing a pair of unit jogs in face-centered cubic nickel at 300K. While the jogs glide conservatively with the edge dislocation at low stresses, we observe that one of the jogs climbs and emits vacancies intermittently at higher stresses. This observation is unexpected at such a low temperature, as climb is typically associated with temperatures closer to the creep temperature (roughly half of the melting temperature). Our results highlight the significance of the complex interplay between point defects (i.e., vacancies) and dislocations in room-temperature plasticity, suggesting that these interactions may be more significant than previously thought.</description>

      <title>One-step Fabrication of Sharp Platinum/Iridium Tips via Amplitude-Modulated Alternating-Current Electropolishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) alloy tip for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was fabricated by amplitude-modulated alternating-current (AC) electropolishing. The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the sinusoidal voltage in the frequency ($f_0$) of $900\ \mathrm{Hz} \leq f_0 \leq 1500\ \mathrm{Hz}$ with amplitude modulation by the sinusoidal wave in the modulation frequency ($f_s$) of $f_s=0.1f_0$ in $\mathrm{CaCl}_2$/$\mathrm{H_2O}$/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The STM imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus AFM analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.</description>

      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e({\bf r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf r})$ in quantum systems. A key issue is kinetic energy since $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise interaction energies. This paper presents a resolution to the problems in two steps: 1) All effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions defined at each point ${\bf r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n({\bf r})$ and are equivalent to a single-particle problem with wavefunction $s({\bf r}) = \sqrt{n({\bf r})/N}$. 2) Forms for the latter terms are proposed based on the nature of energy and stress, where energy has two distinct roles. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the appropriate density involves the terms in the hamiltonian: $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ and interactions in terms of potentials acting on the particles. This leads naturally to density functional theory with the interpretation that the energy density $e({\bf r})$ is equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential throughout the system. On the other hand, the energy and stress (derivative of the energy with respect to strain) are properties of the ground state, and simple examples to show that the only acceptable expressions involve the combination $\frac{1}{4}[|\nabla \Psi|^2 - \Psi\nabla^2 \Psi]$, as derived by Schrodinger, Pauli and others, and Coulomb interactions in the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields, not potentials. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Achieving electrode smoothing by controlling the nucleation phase of metal deposition through polymer-substrate binding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems currently investigated for energy storage applications. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on copper (Cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near-surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate, but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.</description>

      <title>Improved Calculation of Acoustic Deformation Potentials from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), the band structure, phonon dispersion and electron phonon coupling matrix were calculated for silicon (Si), diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN). From these, the acoustic deformation potential was calculated for multiple angles between the electron and phonon wave vectors and analytic expressions for the longitudinal and acoustic modes were fit to find an average deformation potential. The ability to calculate the deformation potential from first principles allows for the scattering rates to be determined without the use of lengthy empirical methods. For Si, the numerically calculated deformation potentials are in excellent agreement with what is seen in the literature. On the other hand, the deformation potentials calculated for diamond were found to be larger than what has been seen previously, however previous calculations of transport parameters in diamond report a large range of values for scattering parameters which may be due to assumptions made in each model. Excellent agreement was also seen between the value calculated for cBN and the literature, however there are no experimental results for cBN and so this value is compared against an estimate. This shows that scattering parameters can be calculated via first principles for materials with sparse experimental data, which in turn allows for increased confidence in the output of charge transport simulations of new and emerging materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spin-coherence decay of NV$^-$-spins interacting with the strongly-coupled bath of nitrogen defects in diamond layers. For thin diamond layers, we demonstrate that the spin-coherence times exceed those of bulk diamond, thus allowing to surpass the limit imposed by high defect concentrations in bulk. We show that the stretched-exponential parameter for the short-time spin-coherence decay is governed by the hyperfine interaction in the bath, thereby constraining random-noise models. We introduce a novel method based on the cluster-correlation expansion applied to strongly-interacting bath partitions. Our results facilitate material development for quantum-technology devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15558v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a maximum coupling rate of 0.91. Our investigation shows the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. We compare coupling strength values derived from the gap size from the measured spectrum with those calculated directly through the coupling parameter and show that the gap size as a measure of coupling strength is limited for the ultra-strong coupling regime. Additionally, analytical calculations show the possibility to reach the deep-strong coupling regime by engineering the magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the potential of vdW AFMs as a model case to study magnetisation dynamics in low-symmetry magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By explicit microscopic construction involving a mapping to a quantum vertex model subject to the `ice rule,' we show that an electronically `trivial' band insulator with suitable vibrational (phonon) degrees of freedom can host a ``resonating valence-bond'' state - a quantum phase with emergent gauge fields. This novel type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless `photon' modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry non-quantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.</description>

Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</description>

      <title>Simple H\"uckel Molecular Orbital Theory for M\"obius Carbon Nanobelts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently synthesized M\"obius carbon nanobelts (CNBs) have gained attention owing to their unique $\pi$-conjugation topology, which results in distinctive electronic properties with both fundamental and practical implications. Although M\"obius conjugation with phase inversion in atomic orbital (AO) basis is well-established for monocyclic systems, the extension of this understanding to double-stranded M\"obius CNBs remains uncertain. This study thoroughly examines the simple H\"uckel molecular orbital (SHMO) theory for describing the $\pi$ electronic structures of M\"obius CNBs. We demonstrate that the adjacency matrix for any M\"obius CNB can preserve its eigenvalues and eigenvectors (with possibly flipped directions) under different placements of the sign inversion, ensuring identical SHMO results regardless of AO phase inversion location. Representative examples of M\"obius CNBs, including the experimentally synthesized one, show that the H\"uckel molecular orbitals (MOs) strikingly resemble the DFT-computed $\pi$ MOs, which were obtained using a herein proposed technique based on the localization and re-delocalization of DFT canonical MOs. Interestingly, the lower-lying $\pi$ MOs exhibit an odd number of nodal planes and are doubly quasidegenerate as a consequence of the phase inversion in M\"obius macrocycles, contrasting with macrocyclic H\"uckel systems. Coulson bond orders derived from SHMO theory correlate well with DFT-calculated Wiberg bond indices for all C-C bonds in tested M\"obius CNBs. Additionally, a remarkable correlation is observed between HOMO-LUMO gaps obtained from the SHMO and GFN2-xTB calculations for a large number of topoisomers of M\"obius CNBs. Thus, the SHMO model not only captures the essence of $\pi$ electronic structure of M\"obius CNBs, but also provides reliable quantitative predictions comparable to DFT results.</description>

      <title>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability in phase field schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector-valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the considered phase field. The occurrence of non-normality requires to look at the pseudospectrum of the considered matrix, namely the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the matrix itself, because the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices can be very sensitive to small perturbations and therefore the spectral analysis alone would not be sufficient to distinguish with certainty between table and unstable behavior. We develop the relevant analyses in the case of quasicrystals for which the values of some constitutive parameters are not known or are uncertain from an experimental point of view, a circumstance suggesting parametric analyses. We find circumstances in which the pseudospectra obtained by means of the so-called structured perturbations predict instability when, instead, the spectral analysis indicates stability.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization for frustrated XXZ spin-1/2 models with field or magnetization along the spin-Z direction at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Application of Madelung Hydrodynamics to Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</description>

      <title>Transmission of radio-frequency waves and nuclear magnetic resonance in lanthanum superhydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. However, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of such superconductors severely limits the number of experimental techniques to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how $^1$H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. In the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$, we observed a pronounced suppression of the $^1$H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses. Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all $^1$H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, evidencing the bulk nature of the superconducting transition. In zero field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. A description of the $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$ data with an exponential form allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ lying between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.</description>

      <title>DPmoire: A tool for constructing accurate machine learning force fields in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In moir\'e systems, the impact of lattice relaxation on electronic band structures is significant, yet the computational demands of first-principles relaxation are prohibitively high due to the large number of atoms involved. To address this challenge, We introduce a robust methodology for the construction of machine learning potentials specifically tailored for moir\'e structures and present an open-source software package DPmoire designed to facilitate this process. Utilizing this package, we have developed machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) materials. Our approach not only streamlines the computational process but also ensures accurate replication of the detailed electronic and structural properties typically observed in density functional theory (DFT) relaxations. The MLFFs were rigorously validated against standard DFT results, confirming their efficacy in capturing the complex interplay of atomic interactions within these layered materials. This development not only enhances our ability to explore the physical properties of moir\'e systems with reduced computational overhead but also opens new avenues for the study of relaxation effects and their impact on material properties in two-dimensional layered structures.</description>

      <title>Time-domain study of coupled collective excitations in quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that often arise from a complex interplay between microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanisms and guided us in manipulating the dynamical properties of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanisms between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to discoveries of the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Using Domain Knowledge with Deep Learning to Solve Applied Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of mechanical behavior is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To demonstrate this, stress-strain curves were used to predict key microstructural features of porous materials, and the performance of models trained with and without domain knowledge was compared using five deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results of the models with domain-specific characteristics consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values and improved learning efficiency compared to models without prior knowledge. When the models did not include domain knowledge, the model results revealed meaningful patterns were not recognized, while those enhanced with mechanical insights showed superior feature extraction and predictions. These findings underscore the critical role of domain knowledge in guiding deep learning models, highlighting the need to combine domain expertise with data-driven approaches to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes in materials science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torque Efficiency: Numerical Study on the Influence of Crystallographic Texture and Polycrystalline Effects on Low-Symmetry Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied as a key mechanism in spintronics applications. However, conventional SOT materials limit the spin polarization direction to the in-plane orientation, which is suboptimal for efficient magnetization switching. Recently, spin currents with spin polarization along multiple directions have been observed in low-symmetry materials, offering a promising energy-efficient strategy for the field-free switching of magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the efficiency of this mechanism is highly dependent on the crystallographic texture of the SOT materials, a critical factor that, to date, has not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation into the impact of both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic textures of SOT materials on the unconventional SOT generated by Dresselhaus-like and out-of-plane spin polarizations. By employing a theoretical orientation distribution function, we calculate the effective unconventional SOT values for SOT materials with tunable crystallographic texture. This analysis provides a framework for the synthesis and optimization of future low-symmetry SOT materials, which can enhance operational efficiency for spintronics applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory and spin logic devices.</description>

      <title>Materials and spin characteristics of amino-terminated nanodiamonds embedded with nitrogen-vacancy color centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with optically read qubits is a key focus of research, as they show high potential for detecting electric and magnetic fields, temperature, and other physico-chemical quantities at the nanoscale, which are highly sought after in chemistry and biology. Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as probes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of FNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly study the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were produced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers were introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the initial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a reduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as reference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to terminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of proteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state stability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the longitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings indicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both $-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$ longitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\mu$s, independent of FND size within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is comparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.</description>
