      <title>Classifying anima of condensed $\infty$-categories of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the classifying anima of two natural condensed $\infty$-categories associated to a coherent $\infty$-topos. One from our work with Barwick and Glasman on exit-path categories in algebraic geometry, and the other from Lurie's work on ultracategories. The key consequence of our comparison is a connection between algebraic geometry and model theory: up to a mild completion, the pro\'{e}tale fundamental group of a scheme and the Lascar group of a complete first-order theory are both special cases of the same construction.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory of $\mathbb{E}_n$-Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21431v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the naive deformation problem of an $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal stable $k$-linear $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is a $2$-proximate formal $\mathbb{E}_{n+2}$-moduli problem, whose corresponding formal moduli problem is controlled by the non-unital $\mathbb{E}_{n+2}$-algebra $\mathrm{fib}\big(\mathrm{End}_{\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{E}_n}(\mathcal{C})}(1)\rightarrow \mathrm{End}_{\mathcal{C}}(1)\big)$, where $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{E}_n}(\mathcal{C})$ is the $\mathbb{E}_n$-center of $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid monoidal and tamely compactly generated by unobstructible objects, then this naive deformation problem is equivalent to the formal moduli problem. We also prove a uniqueness theorem for formal deformations of certain formal moduli problems, which can be applied to the $\mathbb{E}_1$ and $\mathbb{E}_2$-monoidal deformation problems of $\mathbf{Rep}(G)$ for a reductive algebraic group $G$ with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=T_e G$. Finally, we show factorization homology is compatible with deformations.</description>

      <title>Density of fibers for the filtered Fukaya category of $T^*N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Biran and Cornea about the density of iterated cones of fibers in the Fukaya category of a cotangent bundle. We prove that indeed if we take a dense set of basepoints, the iterated cones of the cotangent fibres are dense in the Filtered Fukaya category.</description>

      <title>Univalent Enriched Categories and the Enriched Rezk Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11752v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enriched categories are categories whose sets of morphisms are enriched with extra structure. Such categories play a prominent role in the study of higher categories, homotopy theory, and the semantics of programming languages. In this paper, we study univalent enriched categories. We prove that all essentially surjective and fully faithful functors between univalent enriched categories are equivalences, and we show that every enriched category admits a Rezk completion. Finally, we use the Rezk completion for enriched categories to construct univalent enriched Kleisli categories.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Generalised Born Rule from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process- theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Minimal Projective Resolutions, M\"obius Inversion, and Bottleneck Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the Galois transport distance, defined by factoring two modules through a common "apex" poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules.
  On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions.
  We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and M\"obius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for M\"obius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</description>
