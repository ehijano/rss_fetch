      <title>Magma ocean interactions can explain JWST observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact with the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and magma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, finding that our models can provide a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a sub-Neptune.</description>

      <title>Thin H$_2$-dominated Atmospheres as Signposts of Magmatic Outgassing on Tidally-Heated Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$_2$-dominated terrestrial exoplanets are highly accessible to atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy, but such atmospheres are generally thought to be unstable to escape. Here, we propose that close-in, eccentric terrestrial exoplanets can sustain H$_2$-dominated atmospheres due to intense tidally-driven volcanic degassing. We develop an interior-atmosphere framework to assess whether volcanic outgassing can sustain \ch{H2}-dominated atmospheres over geologic timescales ($\geq$1 Gyr). We incorporate interior redox state, tidal heating, volatile inventory, and planetary parameters to compute outgassing fluxes and confront them with energy-limited hydrodynamic escape. We demonstrate that to sustain an H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, a terrestrial exoplanet must have a water-rich basal magma ocean and reduced melts, in addition to high eccentricity. We additionally demonstrate that detection of a specifically thin H$_2$-dominated atmosphere is a sign of current magmatic outgassing. We delineate an "outgassing zone" (OZ) most favorable to the existence of such planets, and identify the most observationally compelling targets. We propose combining precise mass-radius-eccentricity measurements with JWST constraints on atmospheric mean molecular mass $\mu$ to search for thin H$_2$-dominated atmospheres. Inversely, we argue that robust atmospheric non-detections on OZ exoplanets can constrain the planetary interior, including melt redox state, mantle melt fraction and volatile inventory, and tidal heat flux.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Pebble Drift Across Planet-Opened Gaps in Windy Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a giant planet forms in a protoplanetary disks, it carves a gap around its orbit separating the disk into two parts: inner disk and outer disk. Traditional disk accretion models, which assume material transport is driven by viscosity, reveal that the planet-induced gap acts like a filter which blocks large dust grains from flowing into the inner disk. However, there is growing evidence that material transport may be driven by magnetically-driven winds instead. By carrying out a suite of two-dimensional multi-fluid hydrodynamic simulations where wind is implemented with a parameterized model, we explored how dust filtration efficiency and the size of dust grains filtered change in disks where gas accretion is dominated by magnetically-driven winds. We found that the inward gas flow driven by the wind can enable dust to overcome the pressure bump at the outer gap edge and penetrate the planet-induced gap. The maximum size of dust grains capable of penetrating the gap increasing with the wind strength. Notably, we found that when wind is strong (mass loss rate = 1e-7 M_sun/yr), mm-sized grains can penetrate the gap opened by a multi-Jovian-mass planet. Our results suggest that magnetically driven winds can significantly enhance pebble drift and impact planet formation in the inner protoplanetary disk.</description>

      <title>An automated probabilistic asteroid prediscovery pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated and probabilistic method to make prediscovery detections of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in archival survey images, with the goal of reducing orbital uncertainty immediately after discovery. We refit Minor Planet Center astrometry and propagate the full six-parameter covariance to survey epochs to define search regions. We build low-threshold source catalogs for viable images and evaluate every detected source in a search region as a candidate prediscovery. We eliminate false positives by refitting a new orbit to each candidate and probabilistically linking detections across images using a likelihood ratio. Applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) imaging, we identify approximately 3000 recently discovered NEAs with prediscovery potential, including a doubling of the observational arc for about 500. We use archival ZTF imaging to make prediscovery detections of the potentially hazardous asteroid 2021 DG1, extending its arc by 2.5 years and reducing future apparition sky-plane uncertainty from many degrees to arcseconds. We also recover 2025 FU24 nearly 7 years before its first known observation, when its sky-plane uncertainty covers hundreds of square degrees across thousands of ZTF images. The method is survey-agnostic and scalable, enabling rapid orbit refinement for new discoveries from Rubin, NEO Surveyor, and NEOMIR.</description>

      <title>From gas to ice giants: A unified mechanism for equatorial jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equatorial jets dominating the dynamics of the Jovian planets exhibit two distinct types of zonal flows: strongly eastward in the gas giants (superrotation) and strongly westward in the ice giants (subrotation). Existing theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.</description>

      <title>How Internal Structure Shapes the Metallicity of Giant Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition and internal structure of gas giant exoplanets encode key information about their formation and subsequent evolution. We investigate how different interior structure assumptions affect the inferred bulk metallicity and its correlation with planetary mass. For a sample of 44 giant exoplanets (0.12-5.98 MJ), we compute evolutionary models with CEPAM and retrieve their bulk metallicities under three structural hypotheses: Core+Envelope (CE), Dilute Core (DC), and Fully Mixed (FM). Across all structures, we recover a significant positive correlation between total heavy-element mass (M_Z) and planetary mass (M), and a negative correlation between metallicity (Z) and M (also for Z/Z_star vs. M). DC structures yield metallicities comparable to CE models, regardless of the assumed gradient extent. Increasing atmospheric metallicity raises the inferred bulk metallicity, as enhanced opacities slow planetary cooling. Non-adiabatic DC models can further increase the retrieved metallicity by up to 35%. Sensitivity analyses show that the mass-metallicity anti-correlation is primarily driven by low-mass, metal-rich planets, while massive planets exhibit unexpectedly high metallicities. Improved constraints on convective mixing, combined with upcoming precise measurements of planetary masses, radii, and atmospheric compositions from missions such as PLATO and Ariel, will enable more robust inferences of interior structures and formation pathways for gas giant planets.</description>

      <title>SOAPv4: A new step toward modeling stellar signatures in exoplanet research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and describe a new version of the spot oscillation and planet code, SOAPv4. Our aim is to demonstrate its capabilities in modeling stellar activity in the context of RV measurements and its effects on transmission spectra. To do this, we employed solar observations alongside synthetic spectra and compared the resulting simulations. We used SOAPv4 to simulate photospheric active regions and planetary transits for a Sun-like star hosting a hot Jupiter. By varying the input spectra, we investigated their impact on the resulting absorption spectra and compared the corresponding simulations. We then assessed how stellar activity deforms these absorption profiles. Finally, we explored the chromatic signatures of stellar activity across different wavelength ranges and discussed how such effects have been employed in the literature to confirm planet detections in radial-velocity measurements. We present the latest updates to SOAP, a tool developed to simulate active regions on the stellar disk while accounting for wavelength-dependent contrast. This functionality enables a detailed study of chromatic effects on radial-velocity measurements. In addition, SOAPv4 models planet-occulted line distortions and quantifies the influence of active regions on absorption spectra. Our simulations indicate that granulation can introduce line distortions that mimic planetary absorption features, potentially leading to misinterpretations of atmospheric dynamics. Furthermore, comparisons with ESPRESSO observations suggest that models incorporating non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects provide an improved match to the absorption spectra of HD 209458 b, although they do not fully reproduce all observed distortions.</description>

      <title>Direct Spectroscopy of 51 Eridani b with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-contrast direct spectroscopy of the low-mass, cool exoplanet 51 Eridani b (2-4 M$_\textrm{Jup}$, $\sim$750 K) using JWST / NIRSpec in a fixed-slit configuration (F290LP / G395H, $3-5\,\mu$m, R$\sim$2,700). A cross correlation analysis between the continuum-subtracted data and atmospheric forward models indicates a detection of molecular signals of planetary origin at $4.8\sigma$ at the expected position and velocity of the planet. The detection of the planetary signal is driven primarily by molecular features from methane and carbon monoxide, providing the first direct confirmation of these two molecules coexisting in chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of 51 Eridani b. A new comprehensive atmospheric model analysis shows consistency between the ground-based IFU spectroscopy and the NIRSpec data, with the best-fit model parameters: $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 800$^{+21.5}_{-55.5}$ K, $\log g$ = 3.75$^{+0.09}_{-0.37}$, $[\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}]$ = 0.7$^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$, $\textrm{C}/\textrm{O}$ = 0.458$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, $\log K_\mathrm{zz}$ = 3$^{+0.47}_{-0.73}$, $R_\mathrm{P}$ = 1.36$^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ $R_\mathrm{Jup}$, $f_\mathrm{hole}$ = 0.3$^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$, and the NIRSpec errorbar inflation parameter: $\hat{e}$ = 1.74$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. We conclude with a discussion on the lessons learned between the fixed slit and IFU-based high contrast spectroscopic methods from our observing program, including some possibilities to improve the analysis method.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation-limited dust filtration in 2D simulations of planet-disk systems with dust coagulation. Parameter study and implications for the inner disk's dust mass budget and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-thermal gas giant planets or their progenitor cores are known to open deep gaps in protoplanetary disks, which stop large, drifting dust particles on their way to the inner disk. The possible separation of the disk into distinct reservoirs and the resulting dust depletion interior to the gap have important implications for planetesimal formation and the chemical and isotopic composition of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Dust fragmentation, however, maintains a reservoir of small grains which can traverse the gap. Dust evolution models are thus instrumental for studies of a gap's filtration efficiency. We present 2D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk systems with dust coagulation and fragmentation. For the first time, we evolve a series of 2D simulation with dust coagulation over 45000 planetary orbits and track the dust's size evolution and origin by using the TriPoD dust coagulation method. We investigate the effects of different planetary masses, fragmentation velocities, and viscosities on the inner disk's dust mass budget and composition, and highlight the advantages of multi-dimensional simulations over 1D models. Filtering can only be efficient for high planetary masses, high fragmentation velocities, and low diffusivities. Clear compositional distinctions between the inner and outer disk could not have been maintained by Jupiter's core if the fragmentation velocity was low, even if $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$. Significant "contamination" of the inner disk by outer-disk dust occurs in much less than $2 \times 10^5$ yr in this case and even for more massive objects. This either places tight constraints on the physical conditions in the Solar nebula or mandates consideration of alternative explanations for the NC-CC dichotomy. Astrophysical constraints on the parameters could discriminate between these possibilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terraforming Mars is an age old science fiction concept now worth revisiting through the lens of modern science and technology. This document serves as a summary of contemporary ideas about Mars terraforming, prepared for attendees of the 2025 Green Mars Workshop. It presents one illustrative story of how Mars might be transformed into a habitable world. The story is told in reverse, beginning with possible planetary endpoints and tracing backward to the steps required to reach them. Along the way, it highlights alternative approaches, critical unknowns and research priorities, and the near term applications and benefits of terraforming research for planetary science, climate engineering, and sustainable technologies on Earth.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origin of Water in Planets within Habitable Zones by HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do habitable environments arise and evolve within the context of their planetary systems? This is one fundamental question, and it can be addressed partly by identifying how planets in habitable zones obtain water. Historically, astronomers considered that water was delivered to the Earth via dynamical shake-up by Jupiter, which took place during the formation and post-formation eras (e.g., $\lesssim 100$ Myr). This hypothesis has recently been challenged by a more dynamic view of planet formation; planet-forming materials move in protoplanetary disks via various physical processes such as pebble drift and planetary migration. \textit{Habitable Worlds Observatory} (HWO) will open a new window to address this important, but difficult question by discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets around G-type stars. In this article, we consider two possible working hypotheses: (1) the abundance of water on planets in habitable zones has \textit{any} correlation with the presence of outer planets; and (2) the abundance of water on planets in habitable zones has \textit{no} correlation with the presence of outer planets. We discuss what physical parameters need to be measured to differentiate these two hypotheses and what observational capabilities are desired for HWO to reliably constrain these physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Composition of planetary debris around the white dwarf GD 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf stars with high abundances of heavy elements in their atmospheres and infrared excesses are believed to be accreting planetary material. GD 362 is one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs and has an exceptionally strong mid-infrared excess, reprocessing 2.4% of the star's light into the mid-infrared. We present a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectrum of GD 362 obtained with JWST, covering 0.6 to 17 microns, along with photometry out to 25.5 microns. The mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by an exceptionally strong 9 to 11 micron silicate feature, which can be explained by a combination of olivine and pyroxene silicate minerals. Grains such as carbon, hotter than silicates, are required to explain the near-infrared emission. The silicates and carbon reside in a disk from 140 to 1400 stellar radii, and the disk scale height is greater than half the stellar radius. The elemental abundances of the solid material, relative to Si, are within a factor of 2 of meteoritic (CI chondrites) for C, O, Mg, Al, and Fe, with Al elevated and O slightly depleted. A similar pattern is observed for the abundances of accreted material in the stellar photosphere. Hydrogen is an exception, because no significant H-bearing minerals or water were detected in the disk, despite a large H abundance in the photosphere.</description>

Abstract: Measuring starspot temperatures is crucial for understanding stellar magnetic activity, as it affects stellar brightness variations, influences exoplanet transit measurements, and provides constraints on the physical conditions and energy transport in active regions, offering insights into stellar dynamos. Our goal is to determine the temperature of starspots on the active star CoRoT-2 to enhance our understanding of magnetic activity in young, solar-like stars. Multiwavelength observations were conducted using the SPARC4 instrument on the 1.6-m telescope at Pico dos Dias Observatory (Brazil), capturing simultaneous transit data in four photometric bands (g, r, i, and z). The ECLIPSE model, combined with MCMC fitting, was used to model spot characteristics during the planetary transit of CoRoT-2 b. The spot intensities were analyzed considering three different methods: the assumption of blackbody emission, the PHOENIX atmospheric model, and multiwavelength fitting assuming the same spot parameters for all wavelengths. Two starspots were detected in the residuals of the light curve, yielding temperature estimates of 5040 - 5280 K based on the three different methods. These values align more closely with the temperatures of solar penumbrae than with typical umbral temperatures, suggesting relatively moderate magnetic activity. The radius of the spots ranged from 0.34 - 0.61 the planetary radius, or equivalently (38 - 69)$\times10^6$m, much larger than sunspots. This study provides a method to estimate spot temperatures on active stars using multiband photometry, with results indicating penumbral-like temperatures on CoRoT-2. The methodology enhances precision in starspot temperature estimation, beneficial for studies of stellar activity and exoplanet characterization.</description>

      <title>Revised Mass and Orbit of $\varepsilon$ Eridani b: A 1 Jupiter-Mass Planet on a Near-Circular Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mature Jovian planet $\varepsilon$ Eridani b orbits one of the closest sun-like stars at a moderate separation of 3.5 AU, presenting one of the best opportunities to image a true analog to a solar system planet. We perform a thorough joint reanalysis and cross-validation of all available archival radial velocity and astrometry data, combining data from eight radial velocity instruments and four astrometric sources (Hipparcos, Hubble FGS, Gaia DR2, and Gaia DR3). We incorporate methodological advances that impact our findings including a principled treatment of correlation between Gaia DR2 and DR3 velocity and corrections for the changing light-travel time to this high proper motion system. We revise the planet's mass upward to $0.98 \pm 0.09 \, \mathrm{M_{jup}}$ and find that its orbit is nearly circular and close to coplanar with the outer debris disk. We further present one of the first models of an exoplanet orbit exclusively from absolute astrometry and independently confirm the planet's orbital period. We make specific predictions for the planet's location at key imaging epochs from past and future observing campaigns. We discuss and resolve tensions between previous works regarding the eccentricity, inclination, and mass. Our results further support that $\varepsilon$ Eridani b is one of the closest analogs to a Solar System planet yet detected around a nearby star.</description>

      <title>Analytical estimates for heliocentric escape of satellite ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general analytic framework to assess whether impact ejecta launched from the surface of a satellite can escape the gravitational influence of the planet--satellite system and enter heliocentric orbit. Using a patched-conic approach and defining the transition to planetocentric space via the Hill sphere or sphere of influence, we derive thresholds for escape in terms of the satellite-to-planet mass ratio and the ratio of the satellite's orbital speed to its escape speed. We identify three dynamical regimes for ejecta based on residual speed and launch direction. We complement this analysis with the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), deriving a necessary escape condition from the Jacobi integral at $\mathrm{L_{2}}$ and showing that it is consistent with the patched-conic thresholds. Applying our model to the Earth--Moon system reveals that all three outcomes--bound, conditional, and unbound--are accessible within a narrow range of launch speeds. This behavior is not found in other planetary satellite systems, but may occur in some binary asteroids. The framework also shows that the Moon's tidal migration has not altered its propensity to produce escaping ejecta, reinforcing the plausibility of a lunar origin for some near-Earth asteroids.</description>

      <title>Onset of CN Emission in 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Strong Carbon-Chain Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar objects provide a direct window into the environmental conditions around stars other than the Sun. The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, a new interstellar comet, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to compare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we present the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM Observatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS was inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations captured the onset of optical gas activity. Nightly spectra reveal a weak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first nights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate of $Q$(CN)$\sim6\times$10$^{24}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity observed in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small but measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band $Af\rho$ with values in the order of $\sim300$ cm. We derived a gas-to-dust production ratio of $\log Q (\mathrm{CN})/Af\rho\sim22.4$. Our upper limit on the C$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\log Q(\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\mathrm{CN})\lesssim-0.8$) indicates that 3I/ATLAS is a strongly carbon-chain depleted comet. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore whether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet population.</description>

      <title>Multi-band Spectral and Astrometric Characterization of the HIP 99770 b Planet with SCExAO/CHARIS and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze follow-up, higher resolution ($R$ $\sim$ 70) $H$ and $K$ band integral field spectroscopy of the superjovian exoplanet HIP 99770 b with SCExAO/CHARIS. Our new data recover the companion at a high signal-to-noise ratio in both bandpasses and more than double the astrometric baseline for its orbital motion. Jointly modeling HIP 99770 b's position and the star's astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia yields orbital parameters consistent with those from the discovery paper, albeit with smaller errors, and a slight preference for a smaller semimajor axis ($\sim$15.7--15.8 au)and a larger eccentricity ($\sim$0.28--0.29), disfavoring a circular orbit. We revise its dynamical mass slightly downwards to 15.0$_{-4.4}^{+4.5}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a flat prior and 13.1$_{-5.2}^{+4.8}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a more standard log-uniform mass prior, where the inclusion of its relative radial-velocity measurement is primarily responsible for these changes. We find consistent results for HIP 99770 b's dynamical mass including recent VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry, albeit with a slightly smaller, better constrained eccentricity of $e$ $\sim$ 0.22$^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$. HIP 99770 b is a $\sim$ 1300 K object at the L/T transition with a gravity intermediate between that of the HR 8799 planets and older, more massive field brown dwarfs with similar temperatures but with hints of equilibrium chemistry. HIP 99770 b is particularly well suited for spectroscopic follow up with Roman CGI during the technology demonstration phase at 730 nm to further constrain its metallicity and chemistry; JWST thermal infrared observations could likewise explore the planet's carbon chemistry, metallicity, and clouds.</description>

      <title>An Open-Access Web Tool for Light Curve Simulation and Analysis of Small Solar System Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a web-based application designed to simulate rotational light curves of small airless Solar System bodies under user-defined geometrical and physical conditions. The tool integrates both physical and empirical photometric models and enables users to input custom shape models, surface properties, and viewing geometries. A dedicated module also computes projected silhouettes at the epoch of stellar occultations, allowing direct comparison with observed chords. The application, developed in Python and Django, has been validated using well-characterized targets such as (136108) Haumea, (101955) Bennu, and (433) Eros, showing excellent agreement between synthetic and observed light curves and silhouettes. Beyond standard light curve simulations, the tool supports scenarios including surface heterogeneity, non-principal axis rotation (tumbling), and phase-angle effects. This flexible and accessible platform provides a powerful resource for interpreting photometric data, supporting ongoing observation campaigns, and aiding future mission planning.</description>
