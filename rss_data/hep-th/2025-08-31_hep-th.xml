      <title>Probing the Black Hole Interior with Holographic Entanglement Entropy and the Role of AdS/BCFT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the black hole information loss paradox, a fundamental challenge in theoretical physics. It proposes insights using Holographic Entanglement Entropy (HEE) and the AdS/BCFT correspondence within Horndeski gravity. The work revisits the time-dependent behavior of HEE to probe black hole interiors and examines its implications for the Page curve, which describes the entropy evolution of Hawking radiation. It also discusses the relationship between conformal field theory (CFT) microstates and black hole thermodynamics through the AdS/BCFT correspondence, suggesting that only a subset of microstates corresponds to black holes with smooth interiors, while others may involve firewalls. The study extends black hole thermal entropy to time-dependent entanglement entropy, offering a perspective on the interplay between quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and gravity.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Chern-Simons extensions to QED in $2+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate radiative corrections in the higher-order extension of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model coupled to standard spinor matter in $2+1$ dimensions. We begin analyzing the higher-order gauge sector, where we find the modes and the polarizations vectors associated to a massive photon and ghost field. The higher-order gauge model is canonically quantized and as expected the resulting algebra of creation and annihilation operators corresponds to an indefinite metric in Hilbert space. Subsequently, we compute all relevant one-loop diagrams in the modified QED starting with the fermion self-energy. We show that the induced corrections to the fermion two-point function produce two independent fermionic degrees of freedom, which can be included in a redefined Lagrangian describing two decoupled fermions fields, one corresponding to a physical particle and the other to a negative-norm ghost state. We take advantage of this decomposition to compute the photon polarization operator and the vertex correction, both of which are found to be finite. Finally, we analyze the causal behavior of the model by computing the commutator of gauge fields at different spacetime points, and found that microcausality is preserved.</description>

      <title>Finite entropy sums in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropies associated with spatial subsystems in conventional local quantum field theories are typically divergent when the spatial regions have boundaries. However, in certain linear combinations of the entropies for various subsystems, these divergences may cancel, giving finite quantities that provide information-theoretic data about the underlying state. In this note, we show that all such quantities can be written as linear combinations of three basic types of quantities: i) the entropy of a spatial subsystem minus the entropy of its complementary subsystem, ii) the mutual information between non-adjacent subsystems, and iii) the tripartite information for triples of disjoint sub-systems. For a fixed decomposition of a spatial slice into regions, we describe a basis of sums of entropies for collections of for these regions for which all divergences related to both region boundaries and higher-codimension intersections of regions cancel. Key mathematical technology used in this work (Fourier transforms on the Boolean cube and M\"obius transformations of functions on partially ordered sets) and several of the main proof ideas were suggested by AI (ChatGPT5). We offer a few comments on the use of AI in physics and mathematics, based on our experience.</description>

      <title>$2$-split from Feynman diagrams and Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $2$-split behavior of tree-level amplitudes of bi-adjoint scalar (BAS), Yang-Mills (YM), non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and general relativity (GR) theories under certain kinematic conditions. Our approach begins with a proof, based on the Feynman diagram method, of the $2$-split property for tree-level BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes with $\mathrm{X}={\mathrm{YM},\mathrm{NLSM},\mathrm{GR}}$. The proof relies crucially on a particular pattern in the Feynmam rules of various vertices. Building on this, we use the expansion of X amplitudes into BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes to establish the $2$-split behavior. As a byproduct, we derive universal expansions of the resulting pure X currents into BAS currents, which closely parallel the corresponding on-shell amplitude expansions.</description>

      <title>Dirac particles, spin and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space $X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and $(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles $L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the Schr\"odinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schr\"odinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>M2-brane partition functions and HD supergravity from equivariant topological strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the results of our companion paper, arXiv:2502.20444, which explores the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric Calabi--Yau manifolds $X$, to establish an exact holographic correspondence with M2-brane partition functions. We rigorously test this conjecture within the perturbative regime, incorporating all finite $N$ corrections on the field theory side. Our approach involves additional key details, such as incorporating effective 4d higher-derivative supergravity corrections to introduce refinement. A central result is the derivation of the Airy function representation for the squashed $S^3$ partition function of the field theory, for an arbitrary squashing parameter. We demonstrate that this Airy function structure is universal across all M2-brane models and provide a general expression in terms of the equivariant volume of $X$, incorporating the mesonic deformations corresponding to complexified masses. This expression is then evaluated explicitly for several examples, including ABJM theory, its flavored generalizations, circular quivers, and beyond, demonstrating agreement with the available field theory localization results. We extend the analysis to the superconformal and twisted indices of M2-brane models, and their spindle generalizations, leaving their full perturbative completion for future work. Finally, we explore avenues for generalizing these results to other brane systems, explicitly applying the idea to D3-branes.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Spinor and Twistor Formalism in 3D Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are based on my lectures given at $\text{ST}^4$ 2025 held at IISER Bhopal. We study the application of spinor and twistor methods to three dimensional conformal field theories in these notes. They are divided into three parts dealing with spinor helicity, twistors and super-twistors respectively. In the first part, we introduce the off-shell spinor helicity formalism and apply it in several contexts including double copy relations, connection to four dimensional scattering amplitudes, correlators in Chern-Simons matter theories and the holography of chiral higher spin theory. The second part of the notes introduces the twistor space formalism. After discussing the geometry of twistor space, we derive the Penrose transform for conserved currents, scalars with arbitrary scaling dimension as well as generic non-conserved operators. We also explicitly show how the spinor and twistor approaches are related. We discuss how correlators of these operators and conserved currents in particular drastically simplify in twistor space unveiling their hidden simplicity. We also extend our construction to super-conformal field theories and develop a manifest super-twistor space formalism and derive the supersymmetric Penrose transform. We find that the supersymmetric correlators are simple and natural generalizations of their non-supersymmetric counterparts. The notes are made to be self-contained and also include over $50$ exercises that illustrate the formalism.</description>

      <title>A Two-Gauge Field Model for Magnetoelectric Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a field-theoretical model designed to simulate the presence of material layers with magnetoelectric properties. The model comprises the standard Maxwell field coupled to a Chern-Simons field confined to a planar layer. The electromagnetic behavior of the boundary is emulated through the interaction between the Chern-Simons and Maxwell fields, governed by two parameters: the Chern-Simons mass and the coupling constant between the fields. Both parameters can be adjusted to reflect the specific properties of different materials. We compute the exact propagator of the theory and employ it to investigate several physical properties. Our analysis focuses on phenomena that arise from the presence of external sources coupled to both the Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields, considering various scenarios. In the Chern-Simons sector, the sources emulate defects in the crystal lattice of the material layer. The main objective of this paper is to present the proposed model and to explore its behavior in the simple context of a single planar material interface. We also suggest possible extensions of the model to more general configurations.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, \emph{only} RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconducting correlations in fermionic many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Cherenkov radiation for nonminimal dimension-5 Lorentz violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum Cherenkov radiation is investigated in the Lorentz-violating Standard-Model Extension for isotropic dim-5 operators $\hat{m}$ and $\hat{a}^{\mu}$ in the fermion sector. Both the kinematics and dynamics of this process are analyzed by analytical and numerical means, leading to its decay and radiated-energy rates as functions of the initial-fermion momentum. We adopt the point of view that vacuum Cherenkov radiation is actually a physical phenomenon expected to occur for a charged, massive fermion in the presence of Lorentz violation, when some additional requirements are satisfied. The absence of this effect in ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detected on Earth allows us to infer stringent bounds on isotropic dim-5 Lorentz violation in protons, quarks, and electrons.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel framework to investigate ringdown gravitational waveforms in the presence of dynamical matter fields outside the horizon of a black hole. We systematically analyze two distinct scenarios of dynamical matter fields: motion along geodesics and uniform motion with constant velocity. Our results reveal rich phenomenology in the ringdown gravitational wave signals, including the suppression or enhancement of echoes, frequency shifts in the decay oscillations, and intricate modulations of the power-law tails. Notably, we demonstrate that subluminal moving potentials can produce irregular echo patterns and shift the dominant frequencies, offering potential new observational signatures beyond the already-known ringdown analyses. This study provides a new perspective for probing dynamic environments around black holes and offers a theoretical foundation for interpreting possible deviations in future gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>Transport Model Investigation of NCQ Scaling and the Hadronic-Partonic Transition in Au+Au Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 3.0$ and 4.5 GeV using hadronic and partonic transport models, including JAM, SMASH, AMPT-Hadronic Cascade, and AMPT-String Melting. At 3.0 GeV, hadronic models reproduce the centrality dependence of $v_2$ and the particle ordering ($K^0_S &gt; p &gt; \pi^+$), while violating number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling, indicating that collectivity is primarily driven by hadronic interactions and influenced by spectator shadowing. Forward rapidity shows weaker spectator effects, yielding more positive $v_2$ for heavier hadrons, whereas pions remain largely unaffected. At 4.5 GeV, partonic interactions in the AMPT-String Melting mode significantly enhance NCQ scaling, and turning off final-state hadronic rescattering further clarifies the scaling pattern, highlighting the growing role of partonic degrees of freedom. The energy dependence of $p_T$-integrated $v_2$ reflects the transition from hadronic-dominated dynamics at lower energies to increasing partonic collectivity at higher energies. These results demonstrate that the breakdown of NCQ scaling at 3.0 GeV arises from hadronic interactions, whereas the emergence of scaling at higher energies signals partonic contributions in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>On the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. After showing that such modules are free or ``almost free'', we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra which lets us construct BCCA-modules intrinsically. In particular, we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</description>

      <title>Small $x$ behavior in QCD from maximal entanglement and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that, at small Bjorken $x$, QCD evolution drives the proton into a state of maximal entanglement. If the evolution kernel is assumed to be conformally invariant -- as is the case for the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation -- we can describe it by a conformal field theory. Moreover, the central charge $c$ of the corresponding conformal field theory emerges as the key parameter governing the $x$-dependence of both the entanglement entropy and the structure function. Here we apply the exact Bethe Ansatz methods to the quantum spin chain dual to Lipatov's high energy effective action to extract the central charge of the theory, and find that $c=1$. This implies the $\sim x^{-1/3}$ small $x$ behavior for the structure function -- the prediction that can be tested at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Long-distance reconstruction of QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-distance contribution of QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization is particularly challenging to compute in lattice QCD+QED. Currently, it is one of the limiting factors towards matching the precision of the recent result by the Fermilab E989 experiment for the muon g-2. In this work, we present a method for obtaining high-precision results for this contribution by reconstructing exclusive finite-volume state contributions. We find relations between the pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams and demonstrate the reconstruction method with lattice QCD+QED data at a single lattice spacing of $a^{-1} \approx 1.73$ GeV and $m_\pi \approx 275$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Gluon emission by a $q\bar{q}$ antenna with realistic parton-medium interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of coherent gluon radiation from a quark-anti-quark pair experiencing multiple scatterings within a coloured medium is central for understanding in-medium parton cascades. Despite its foundational importance, current results are limited by reliance on simplified scattering rates, such as the harmonic oscillator approximation, valid only in restricted phase-space regions. Using the formalism introduced in a previous article, we express the gluon emission spectrum as a set of differential equations that can be solved numerically, circumventing conventional approximations. We present the transverse momentum and energy distributions of emitted gluons for realistic interaction models, illustrating the breakdown of colour coherence across the entire accessible phase-space, and consequently enabling a higher-precision description of jet observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize how a renormalization-group (RG)-consistent treatment removes well-known artifacts in NJL-model descriptions of color-superconducting quark matter. We introduce two RG-consistent schemes, "minimal" and "massless", and present analytic solutions for the diquark gap at $T=0$ and for the phase boundary $T_c(\mu)$ in symmetric massless matter, representing the high-density limit of the model. We compare the pairing gaps, phase diagram, and speed of sound with results obtained using conventional regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present models of axion based on supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. In these models, the PQ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the non-perturbative dynamics of chiral gauge theory. Thanks to supersymmetry, IR dynamics of the models are calculable. We also present an example of a QCD axion model that is compatible with SU(5) grand unification. We find that the PQ breaking scale should be higher than $\sim 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$ for the successful GUT unification. In addition, the PQ breaking scale should be higher than the GUT scale to avoid a Landau pole of gauge coupling below the Planck scale.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel holographic dictionary for the thermodynamics of black holes with Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating asymptotics, generalizing the dictionary for Anti-de Sitter black holes. Using our dictionary we show that the holographic Euler equation is dual to a generalized Smarr formula for these black holes, and we find a precise match between the extended bulk and boundary first law. Notably, the dictionary for the central charge appearing in the Euler relation depends on the hyperscaling violating parameter, but not on the Lifshitz dynamical exponent.</description>

      <title>Equivariant localization for $D=4$ gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric solutions of $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ Euclidean gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets. Such solutions admit an R-symmetry Killing vector, $\xi$, constructed as a bilinear in the Killing spinor. The Killing spinor bilinears can also be used to construct polyforms that are equivariantly closed under the action of the equivariant exterior derivative $\mathrm{d}_\xi=\mathrm{d}-\xi\mathbin{\rule[.2ex]{.4em}{.03em}\rule[.2ex]{.03em}{.9ex}}\,$. This allows one to compute various flux integrals and the on-shell action using localization, without solving any supergravity equations, just assuming the supersymmetric solutions exist. The flux integrals allow one to obtain important UV-IR relations, relating fixed point data in the bulk to data on the asymptotic AdS boundary, allowing one to express the gravitational free energy in terms of boundary SCFT data. We illustrate the formalism with a number of examples, including classes of solutions which are unlikely to ever be constructed in closed form.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Krylov State Complexity in Random Matrix Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, time-evolved states typically remain confined to a smaller region of the Hilbert space known as the $\textit{Krylov subspace}$. The time evolution can be mapped onto a one-dimensional problem of a particle moving on a chain, where the average position $\langle n \rangle$ defines Krylov state complexity or spread complexity. Generalized spread complexities, associated with higher-order moments $\langle n^p \rangle$ for $p&gt;1$, provide finer insights into the dynamics. We investigate the time evolution of generalized spread complexities following a quantum quench in random matrix theory. The quench is implemented by transitioning from an initial random Hamiltonian to a post-quench Hamiltonian obtained by dividing it into four blocks and flipping the sign of the off-diagonal blocks. This setup captures universal features of chaotic quantum quenches. When the initial state is the thermofield double state of the post-quench Hamiltonian, a peak in spread complexity preceding equilibration signals level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos. We examine the robustness of this peak for other initial states, such as the ground state or the thermofield double state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. To quantify this behavior, we introduce a measure based on the peak height relative to the late-time saturation value. In the continuous limit, higher-order complexities show increased sensitivity to the peak, supported by numerical simulations for finite-size random matrices.</description>

Abstract: We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometries the square norm of the twistor 2-form is quadratic in moment maps, and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.</description>

Abstract: We unify the dynamics of massive vector (Proca) fields in Schwarzschild spacetime with supersymmetric gauge theories through the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal mode (SW/QNM) duality. By mapping Proca perturbations-specifically monopole and odd-parity modes governed by confluent Heun equations-to the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve, we establish a gauge-gravity correspondence. Leveraging instanton counting, we analytically compute QNM and quasi-bound state frequencies to high precision, resolving spectral properties non-perturbatively. Our results align with numerical benchmarks while extending the SW framework beyond scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, focusing in particular on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This approach regularizes the integration over non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces, producing finite results at each order in the expansion, as illustrated by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri--Strominger--Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarised IKKT matrix model is the worldpoint theory of $N$ D-instantons in a background three-form flux of magnitude $\Omega$, and promises to be a highly tractable model of holography. The matrix integral can be viewed as a statistical physics partition function with inverse temperature $\Omega^4$. At large $\Omega$ the model is dominated by a matrix configuration corresponding to a 'polarised' spherical D1-brane. We show that at a critical value of $\Omega^2 N$ the model undergoes a first order phase transition, corresponding to tunneling into a collection of well-separated D-instantons. These instantons are the remnant of a competing saddle in the high $\Omega$ phase corresponding to spherical $(p,q)$ fivebranes. We use a combination of numerical and analytical arguments to capture the different regimes of the model.</description>

Abstract: Using the solution phase space method, we investigate the conserved charges of BTZ-like black holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity. Our study shows that the black hole mass, angular momentum and entropy are influenced by the Lorentz-violating parameter. Through the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we derive the asymptotic charge algebra, which consists of two copies of the Virasoro algebra with non-trivial central charges. By employing the Cardy formula, we calculate the microscopic entropy of dual conformal field theory, which precisely matches with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Furthermore, by imposing the Detournay-Smoes-Wutte boundary conditions in the near horizon geometry of the extremal BTZ-like black hole, we obtain a Virasoro-Kac-Moody $\mathrm{U(1)}$ algebra, representing the symmetry algebra of a warped conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

Abstract: BPS states in holographic CFTs naturally split into those describing black holes in the bulk and those that do not, with black hole states only existing above a certain energy threshold. In the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality this can be seen from the agreement of the CFT and supergraviton supersymmetric indices up to a certain central charge-scaling conformal dimension. However, there also exist additional smooth horizonless bulk configurations called singletons that have not been previously accounted for when distinguishing black hole states from non-black hole states. These singletons describe bulk degrees of freedom that are non-trivial on the AdS$_3$ boundary. From a detailed analysis of BPS states in the D1-D5 system we identify singleton states in $\mathrm{Sym}^N(T^4)$ and $\mathrm{Sym}^N(K3)$ and explicitly incorporate them into a generalised supergraviton index for low levels for the case of $N=2$, leading to an enhanced matching with the CFT index in the case of $T^4$. Singleton states are monotone and, under the assumption that together with supergraviton states they span the monotone Hilbert space, the generalised supergraviton index represents the full monotone index. This allows us to define fortuitous indices for these theories and for $\mathrm{Sym}^2(K3)$ we construct the first explicit fortuitous states.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for A-polynomials II: $\mathfrak{su}_3$ and Kuberberg bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of quantum A-polynomials -- equations for knot polynomials with respect to their coloring (representation-dependence) -- as the relations between different links, obtained by hanging additional ``simple'' components on the original knot. Depending on the choice of this ``decoration'', the knot polynomial is either multiplied by a number or decomposes into a sum over ``surrounding'' representations by a cabling procedure. What happens is that these two of decorations, when complicated enough, become dependent -- and this provides an equation. Remarkably it can be made independent of the representation. However, the equivalence of links is not a topological property -- it follows from the properties of $R$-matrices, and strongly depends on the choice the gauge group and particular links. The relatively well studied part of the story concerns $\mathfrak{su}_2$, where $R$-matrices can be chosen in an especially convenient Kauffman form, what makes the derivation of equations rather geometrical. To make these geometric methods somewhat simpler we suggest to use an arcade formalism/representation of the braid group to simplify decorating links universally. Here we attempt to extend this technique to the next case, $\mathfrak{su}_3$, where the Kauffman rule is substituted by a more involved Kuberberg rule, still remains more geometric than generic analysis of MOY-diagrams, needed for higher ranks. Already in this case we encounter a classification problem for possible ``decorations'' and emergence of two-lined Young diagrams in enumeration of representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous attempts to overspin or overcharge Kerr-Sen black holes have been incomplete, as they neglect back-reaction effects. In this study, we incorporate the self-energy of perturbations, resulting from the induced increase in the angular velocity and the electrostatic potential of the event horizon, as described in a seminal work by Will. Our analysis demonstrates that Kerr-Sen black holes cannot be overspun or overcharged by perturbations that satisfy the null energy condition, within a comprehensive second-order framework that includes the self-energy of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Vacuum in Discrete Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a quantum cellular automata model of fermions in discrete spacetime which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks: Bridging higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory and BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book offers a comprehensive introduction to spectral networks from a unified viewpoint that bridges geometry with the physics of supersymmetric gauge theories. It provides the foundational background needed to approach the frontiers of this rapidly evolving field, treating geometric and physical aspects in parallel. After surveying fundamental topics in algebra and geometry, a detailed introduction to higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory is developed, including Fock-Goncharov theory for Hitchin representations, maximal representations and the more recent notion of $\Theta$-positivity. Spectral networks are subsequently introduced, emphasizing their utility in the study of character varieties via the abelianization and non-abelianization maps they define. In parallel, key aspects of four-dimensional gauge dynamics with eight supercharges are explored, including electric-magnetic duality, Seiberg-Witten theory, and class $\mathcal S$ theories. The role of spectral networks as a framework for determining and analyzing BPS spectra in class $\mathcal S$ theories is then examined. The final chapter outlines recent applications of spectral networks across a range of contemporary research areas. This volume is intended for researchers and advanced students in either mathematics or physics who wish to enter the field.</description>

      <title>Curvature, area and Gauss-Bonnet formula of the Moyal sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied some geometric properties of the Moyal sphere. Using the conformal metric of the sphere in ordinary space and the matrix basis, we calculated the scalar curvature, total curvature integral and area of the Moyal sphere. We found that when the noncommutative parameter approaches to 0, the scalar curvature and area of the Moyal sphere return to those of the ordinary sphere. As the noncommutative parameter increases, the area of the Moyal sphere will decrease and eventually approach to 0. We found that the total curvature integral of the two-dimensional Moyal sphere still satisfies the usual Gauss-Bonnet formula and does not depend on the noncommutative parameter. We also calculated the approximate expression of the conformal metric with a constant curvature and obtained the corresponding correction function. In addition, we studied a type of generalized deformed Moyal sphere with two noncommutative parameters and obtained similar results.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbits around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-global monopole spacetime in a homogeneous magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of charged particles in the spacetime of a global monopole swallowed by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole in the presence of an external, weak, asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field. We carefully analyze and deduce the conditions to have such a magnetic field around this black hole and show that this is indeed possible in the small but nontrivial charge and monopole term limit. We obtain the general equations of motion and analyze them for special cases of circular orbits, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of this configuration. The richness of the parameters and complicated forms of the resulting equations of motion necessitate a numerical approach. Hence, we have presented our results with numerous graphs, which help to understand the evolution of ISCO as a function of the external test magnetic field and the monopole term, depending on the parameters of the black hole, such as its electric charge, as well as the properties of the test particle, such as its specific charge, angular momentum, and energy. We have also analyzed the effective potential that these fields generate and deduced results for the aforementioned values of the external and internal parameters of the spacetime.</description>

      <title>Minimal Magnetogenesis: The Role of Inflationary Perturbations and ALPs, and Its Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass $&lt;10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim 80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at Mpc scale, consistent with observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi-natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic temperature-dependent dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension-five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

      <title>Center vortices in the novel phase of staggered fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometry of center vortices is studied in the novel lattice-artefact phase that appears with staggered fermions to elucidate any insight provided by the center-vortex degrees of freedom. For various numbers of fermion flavors, the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered-fermion action is broken in a finite region of the $(\beta, m)$ phase space. Simulations are performed with six degenerate fermion flavors and a range of $\beta$ values that span the phase boundary. Center vortices are demonstrated to capture the broken shift symmetry that manifests in the unphysical phase. This persists at the level of each individual plaquette orientation, where it is revealed that only the plaquettes that span the broken dimension are affected. Several bulk center-vortex quantities, including the vortex and branching point densities, are considered to highlight other aspects of vortex geometry sensitive to the unphysical phase. A slight preference for the plaquettes affected by the broken shift symmetry to be pierced by a vortex is observed. This translates also to a greater branching point density in three-dimensional slices that span the broken dimension. Combined, these findings provide a novel characterization of the unphysical phase in terms of the fundamental center degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\sigma$, $1.91\sigma$, $2.19\sigma$, and $2.99\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\sigma$, $2.24\sigma$, $2.51\sigma$, and $2.96\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\sigma$ to $1.84\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0&gt;-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\omega_0\to-1$); moreover, $\omega_0^{\mathrm{(LRG2)}}&gt;w_0^{\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\ln\mathrm{BF}\equiv\ln(Z_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\omega_0\omega_a\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\omega_0&gt;-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\omega_0$$\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Conformal Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A lattice study of two dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with a single massless Majorana fermion</title>

Abstract: Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition function.</description>

      <title>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17654</link>

Abstract: The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.</description>
