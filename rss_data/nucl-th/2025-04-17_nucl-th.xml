      <title>Low-energy neutrino responses for 71Ga by electron capture rates, charge exchange reactions and shell model calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak Gamow-Teller (GT) responses for low-lying states in ${}^{71}\mathrm{Ga}$ are crucial for studying low-energy solar neutrinos and the Ga anomaly, i.e., the possible transition to the sterile state. The responses for the ground state, the first excited state, and the second excited state are evaluated for the first time using the experimental electron capture rates, the experimental charge exchange reaction (CER) rates corrected for the tensor-interaction effect and the theoretical interacting shell model (ISM) calculations. The contributions from the two excited states to the solar and ${}^{51}\mathrm{Cr}$ neutrinos are found to be $4.2 \pm 1.2\%$ of that for the ground state. This is slightly larger than the ISM values but little smaller than the CER values without corrections for the tensor interaction effect. The Ga anomaly is far beyond the uncertainty of the obtained nuclear responses.</description>

      <title>Moment of inertia for pair rotation: Interplay between order parameter and shell structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Background] Pair condensation in finite nuclei generates a collective motion known as pair rotation. The moment of inertia of pair rotation (P-MoI) has been used as an indicator of pair condensation. [Purpose] We aim to elucidate the fundamental properties of the P-MoI, particularly its dependence on the particle number and the order parameter. [Method] The P-MoI was evaluated using the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) calculations with a monopole pairing Hamiltonian and Skyrme density functional theory calculations with different density-dependent pairing energy density functionals. [Results] In open-shell nuclei, a negative correlation was found between the P-MoI and the pair amplitude, which is the order parameter for the transition from the normal phase to the superconducting phase. Analysis based on the decomposition of the P-MoI into the orbital contributions within the BCS approximation shows that its orbital dependence is very similar to that of the pairing gap. [Conclusions] The P-MoI reflects the influence of both the level density near the Fermi energy and the pair amplitude.</description>

      <title>Global $\Lambda$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD), the global $\Lambda$ polarization ($P_\Lambda$) is calculated in Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq$ 9 GeV, in which high baryon density is achieved. Various contributions to $P_\Lambda$ are considered: those from the thermal vorticity, meson field, thermal shear and spin-Hall effect. Feed-down from higher-lying resonances is also taken into account. The results are compared with available data. Special attention is payed to the collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV, for which a thorough scan of the energy, rapidity, and centrality dependence of $P_\Lambda$ is performed. The results for 3 GeV reasonably well reproduce the corresponding STAR data. While the results at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV can be considered as predictions for results of measurements within the STAR fixed-target (STAR-FXT) programthat are expected in the nearest future. It is predicted that a broad maximum of $P_\Lambda$ is reached at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3--3.9 GeV, exact position of which depends on the centrality and width of the midrapidity range of observation. Impact of the meson-field, thermal-shear and spin-Hall-effect contributions to $P_\Lambda$ is also studied.</description>

      <title>$R$-matrix type parametrization of the Jost function for extracting the resonance parameters from scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method is proposed for fitting non-relativistic binary-scattering data and for extracting the parameters of possible quantum resonances in the compound system that is formed during the collision. The method combines the well-known $R$-matrix approach with the analysis based on the semi-analytic representation of the Jost functions. It is shown that such a combination has the advantages of both these approaches, namely, the number of the fitting parameters remains relatively small (as for the $R$-matrix approach) and the proper analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is preserved (as for the Jost function method). It is also shown that the new formalism, although closely related to the $R$-matrix method, has the benefit of no dependence on an arbitrary channel radius. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are tested using a model single-channel potential. Artificial ``experimental'' data generated with this potential are fitted, and its known resonances are successfully recovered as zeros of the Jost function on the appropriate sheet of the Riemann surface of the energy.</description>

      <title>Quasi-particle hydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics of a system of quasi-particles from the Boltzmann equation within the ambit of relaxation time approximation with modified collision kernels. We focus on two specific scenarios with single quasi-particle species, (i) the extended relaxation time approximation, and (ii) the novel relaxation time approximation. We find that both approaches lead to equivalent results up to first-order in spacetime gradients. We generalize the extended relaxation time approach to incorporate multiple quasi-particle species and obtain the corresponding expressions for the shear ($\eta_s$) and bulk ($\zeta_s$) viscous coefficients. As an application, we study the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients of hot QCD medium with quasi-gluon and (light and strange) quasi-quark sectors considering the power law ansatz for the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. We explore the impact of the power law exponent on the ratio $\zeta_s/\eta_s$. Our study suggests that in comparison to a constant exponent, a temperature dependent exponent in the power law ansatz is more suitable for modeling the quasi-particle dynamics in the relevant temperature regime of heavy ion collision.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulations of nuclear resonances with variational methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body nature of nuclear physics problems poses significant computational challenges. These challenges become even more pronounced when studying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum many-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing a variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and implementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling technique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum simulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing quantum simulations of nuclear shell model with noise-resilient protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the computational limitations in solving the nuclear many-body problem could be overcome by utilizing quantum computers. The nuclear shell-model calculations providing deeper insights into the properties of atomic nuclei, is one such case with high demand for resources as the size of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles involved. Quantum algorithms are being developed to overcome these challenges and advance such calculations. To develop quantum circuits for the nuclear shell-model, leveraging the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We aim to minimize resource requirements (specifically in terms of qubits and gates) and strive to reduce the impact of noise by employing relevant mitigation techniques. We achieve noise resilience by designing an optimized ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on Givens rotations and incorporating qubit-ADAPT-VQE in combination with variational quantum deflation (VQD) to compute ground and excited states incorporating the zero-noise extrapolation mitigation technique. Furthermore, the qubit requirements are significantly reduced by mapping the basis states to qubits using Gray code encoding and generalizing transformations of fermionic operators to efficiently represent manybody states. By employing the noise-resilient protocols, we achieve the ground and excited state energy levels of 38Ar and 6Li with better accuracy. These energy levels are presented for noiseless simulations, noisy conditions, and after applying noise mitigation techniques. Results are compared for Jordan Wigner and Gray code encoding using VQE, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and VQD. Our work highlights the potential of noise-resilient protocols to leverage the full potential of NISQ devices in scaling the nuclear shell model calculations.</description>

      <title>Charge radii of neutron-rich scandium isotopes and the seniority symmetry in the $0f_{7/2}$ shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear charge radii of neutron-rich $^{47-49}$Sc isotopes were measured using collinear laser spectroscopy at CERN-ISOLDE. The new data reveal that the charge radii of scandium isotopes exhibit a distinct trend between $N=20$ and $N=28$, with $^{41}$Sc and $^{49}$Sc isotopes having similar values, mirroring the closeness of the charge radii of $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. Theoretical models that successfully interpret the radii of calcium isotopes could not account for the observed behavior in scandium radii, in particular the reduced odd-even staggering. Remarkably, the inclusion of the new $^{49}$Sc radius data has unveiled a similar trend in the charge radii of $N=28$ isotones and $Z=20$ isotopes when adding the neutrons atop the $^{40}$Ca core and the protons atop the $^{48}$Ca core, respectively. We demonstrate that this trend is consistent with the prediction of the seniority model.</description>

      <title>Suppression of composition g-modes in chemically-equilibrating warm neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to T~5 MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>Level-anticrossing in B(E2) anomaly (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new mechanism for explaining the B(E2) anomaly was given by F. Pan \emph{et al.} (PRC, 110, 054324, 2024), which is realized in the parameter region from the SU(3) symmetry limit to the O(6) symmetry limit, and seems to be not related to the SU(3) symmetry. However, through SU(3) analysis, a new technique proposed recently, we found that it is not so. The new mechanism is related to level-anticrossing phenomenon, which is related to level-crossing phenomenon in the SU(3) symmetry limit. By incorporating previous ideas, we have a more general explanatory framework for the B(E2) anomaly, which is important for understanding some higher-order interactions in the interacting boson model. Through analysis, it is shown that level-anticrossing in this mechanism mainly results from the third-order interaction $[\hat{L}\times \hat{Q}_{\chi} \times \hat{L}]^{(0)}$. Finally, the B(E2) anomaly in $^{170}$Os is also discussed within this general framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present several improvements of the non-relativistic Friedrichs-Lee model with multiple discrete and continuous states and still retain its solvability. Our findings establish a solid theoretical basis for the exploration of resonance phenomena in scenarios involving multiple interfering states across various channels. The scattering amplitudes associated with the continuum states naturally adhere to coupled-channel unitarity, rendering this framework particularly valuable for investigating hadronic resonant states appearing in multiple coupled channels. Moreover, this generalized framework exhibits a wide-range applicability, enabling investigations into resonance phenomena across diverse physical domains, including hadron physics, nuclear physics, optics, and cold atom physics, among others.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological study of the angle between jet axes in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a phenomenological study on the angle between the Standard and the Winner-Take-All (WTA) jet axes ($\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$) in high-energy nuclear collisions. The $p$+$p$ baseline is provided by the Pythia8 event generator. The in-medium jet propagation is simulated by the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model, which considers both the elastic and inelastic jet-medium interactions. Our theoretical results calculated by the LBT model show that the $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution in Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV is narrower than that in $p$+$p$, which agrees well with the recent ALICE measurements. The narrowing of $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ seems to violate the $p_T$-broadening nature of the jet quenching effect, usually explained by the influence of "selection bias". However, the physical details still need to be fully understood. Utilizing a matching-jet method to track the jet evolution in the QGP to remove the selection bias in the Monte Carlo simulations, we observe that the $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution becomes broader due to the jet-medium interactions. At the same time, by rescaling the quark/gluon-jet fractions in Pb+Pb collisions to be the same as that in $p$+$p$, we find that the fraction change may not significantly influence the modification pattern of jet $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$. On the other hand, the selected jet sample in A+A collisions has a significantly narrower initial $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution than the $p$+$p$ baseline, and such a biased comparison between $p$+$p$ and A+A conceals the actual jet-broadening effect in the experimental measurements. The investigations presented in this paper will deepen our understanding of the relationship between the actual intra-jet modifications in the QGP and the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Evidence for Planck Transformation of Temperature: Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis Blast-Wave Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physics, thermodynamic quantities are governed by two mutually exclusive relativistic transformations: the Planck and Ott transformations. This study derives both transformations from the fundamental principles of relativistic mechanics and equilibrium thermodynamics, treating the fundamental thermodynamic potential as a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function for a moving system. We show that the Planck transformations align with the core principles of both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics, whereas the Ott transformations deviate from the foundational principles of Hamiltonian mechanics. These findings are supported by analysis of an ultrarelativistic ideal gas of quarks and gluons in the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Additionally, we develop Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis blast-wave models for finite-volume systems. By comparing local equilibrium transverse momentum distributions of hadrons -- derived from these models using the Planck and Ott transformations -- with global equilibrium distributions from Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis formalisms, using identical parameters in the laboratory reference frame, we find that only the Planck transformations yield accurate results, while the Ott transformations produce significant discrepancies.</description>

      <title>The Fox-Wolfram Moment of Jet Production in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical investigation of Fox-Wolfram moments (FWMs) for multi-jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, jet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event generator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to simulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD matter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet number $n_\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at small $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For events with $n_\text{jet}&gt;2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet quenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment $H_1^T$ for events with $n_\text{jet}\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble those of events with $n_\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the relative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet numbers to $H_1^T$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.069 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.356 eV [Zhang et al., Nature 633, 63 (2024)]. Therefore, the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion provides a unique opportunity to study the nuclear excitation by electron transition process under well-defined atomic conditions in the regime of extremely low nuclear excitation energy. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.27\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV), but drops many orders of magnitude for the value of electronic transition energy within its uncertainty interval. Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap, the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from a few to approximately $7\times10^{19}$ $^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Universal Mass Equation for Equal-Quantum Excited-States Sets I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of fifteen baryon sets and twenty-four meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states, using Breit-Wigner PDG masses and their uncertainties at fixed $J^P$ for baryons and $J^{PC}$ for mesons, are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithmic function, $M_n = \alpha Ln(n) + \beta$, where $n$ is the level of radial excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryons (including LHCb exotic $P_{c\bar{c}}^+$s) and meson excited states (including $s\bar{s}$, $s\bar{c}$, $c\bar{c}$, $c\bar{b}$, and $b\bar{b}$ states) are related by the logarithmic function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states. The baryon ``star'' rating case is evaluated. The Cornell potential is an example of how a logarithmic behavior can be explained by an appropriate potential. Thus, a ``universal mass equation'' (UME) for equal-quantum excited-state sets is presented.</description>

      <title>Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model: Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\varepsilon_{\text{trans}}/\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\Delta \varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\Delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 &gt; 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.</description>
