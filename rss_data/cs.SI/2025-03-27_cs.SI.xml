      <title>Unifying Structural Proximity and Equivalence for Enhanced Dynamic Network Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic network embedding methods transform nodes in a dynamic network into low-dimensional vectors while preserving network characteristics, facilitating tasks such as node classification and community detection. Several embedding methods have been proposed to capture structural proximity among nodes in a network, where densely connected communities are preserved, while others have been proposed to preserve structural equivalence among nodes, capturing their structural roles regardless of their relative distance in the network. However, most existing methods that aim to preserve both network characteristics mainly focus on static networks and those designed for dynamic networks do not explicitly account for inter-snapshot structural properties. This paper proposes a novel unifying dynamic network embedding method that simultaneously preserves both structural proximity and equivalence while considering inter-snapshot structural relationships in a dynamic network. Specifically, to define structural equivalence in a dynamic network, we use temporal subgraphs, known as dynamic graphlets, to capture how a node's neighborhood structure evolves over time. We then introduce a temporal-structural random walk to flexibly sample time-respecting sequences of nodes, considering both their temporal proximity and similarity in evolving structures. The proposed method is evaluated using five real-world networks on node classification where it outperforms benchmark methods, showing its effectiveness and flexibility in capturing various aspects of a network.</description>

      <title>Fully personalized PageRank and algebraic methods to distribute a random walker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of algebraic methods for controlling the stationary distribution of PageRank-like random walkers. Building upon existing literature, we compile and extend results regarding both structural control (through network modifications) and parametric control (through measure parameters) of these centralities. We characterize the conditions for complete control of centrality scores and the weaker notion of ranking control, establishing bounds for the required parameters. Our analysis includes classical PageRank alongside two generalizations: node-dependent dampings and node-dependent personalization vector, with the latter being a novel idea in the literature. We examine how their underlying random walk structures affect their controllability, and we also investigate the concepts of competitors and leaders in centrality rankings, providing insights into how parameter variations can influence node importance hierarchies. These results advance our understanding of the interplay between algebraic control and stochastic dynamics in network centrality measures.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Health Insights with SDoH Data: A Comprehensive Open-Access Database and SDoH-EHR Linkage Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a crucial role in influencing health outcomes, accounting for nearly 50% of modifiable health factors and bringing to light critical disparities among disadvantaged groups. Despite the significant impact of SDoH, existing data resources often fall short in terms of comprehensiveness, integration, and usability. Methods: To address these gaps, we developed an extensive Exposome database and a corresponding web application, aimed at enhancing data usability and integration with electronic health record (EHR) to foster personalized and informed healthcare. We created a robust database consisting of a wide array of SDoH indicators and an automated linkage tool designed to facilitate effortless integration with EHR. We emphasized a user-friendly interface to cater to researchers, clinicians, and public health professionals. Results: The resultant Exposome database and web application offer an extensive data catalog with enhanced usability features. The automated linkage tool has demonstrated efficiency in integrating SDoH data with EHRs, significantly improving data accessibility. Initial deployment has confirmed scalability and robust spatial data relationships, facilitating precise and contextually relevant healthcare insights. Conclusion: The development of an advanced Exposome database and linkage tool marks a significant step toward enhancing the accessibility and usability of SDoH data. By centralizing and integrating comprehensive SDoH indicators with EHRs, this tool empowers a wide range of users to access high-quality, standardized data. This resource will have a lasting impact on personalized healthcare and equitable health landscape.</description>

      <title>Counting How the Seconds Count: Understanding Algorithm-User Interplay in TikTok via ML-driven Analysis of Video Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short video streaming systems such as TikTok, Youtube Shorts, Instagram Reels, etc have reached billions of active users. At the core of such systems is a (proprietary) recommendation algorithm which recommends a sequence of videos to each user, in a personalized way. We aim to understand the temporal evolution of recommendations made by these algorithms and the interplay between the recommendations and user experience. While past work has studied recommendation algorithms using textual data (e.g., titles, hashtags, etc.) as well as user studies and interviews, we add a third modality of analysis - automated analysis of the videos themselves. Our content-based analysis framework leverages recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs). Together we use this trifecta of methodologies (analysis of user watch history and logs, user studies and interviews, and content-based analysis) to analyze challenging temporal aspects of how well TikTok's recommendation algorithm is received by users, is affected by user interactions, and aligns with user history; as well as how users are sensitive to the order of videos recommended, and how the algorithm's effectiveness itself may be predictable in the future. While it is not our goal to reverse-engineer TikTok's recommendation algorithm, our new findings indicate behavioral aspects that both users and algorithm developers would benefit from.</description>

      <title>Peer Disambiguation in Self-Reported Surveys using Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying peer relationships is crucial in solving complex challenges underserved communities face and designing interventions. The effectiveness of such peer-based interventions relies on accurate network data regarding individual attributes and social influences. However, these datasets are often collected through self-reported surveys, introducing ambiguities in network construction. These ambiguities make it challenging to fully utilize the network data to understand the issues and to design the best interventions. We propose and solve two variations of link ambiguities in such network data -- (i) which among the two candidate links exists, and (ii) if a candidate link exists. We design a Graph Attention Network (GAT) that accounts for personal attributes and network relationships on real-world data with real and simulated ambiguities. We also demonstrate that by resolving these ambiguities, we improve network accuracy, and in turn, improve suicide risk prediction. We also uncover patterns using GNNExplainer to provide additional insights into vital features and relationships. This research demonstrates the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to advance real-world network data analysis facilitating more effective peer interventions across various fields.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Interaction Matters: Dynamic Hypergraph Neural Networks for Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing need for effective epidemic modeling has driven advancements in capturing the complex dynamics of infectious diseases. Traditional models, such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, and graph-based approaches often fail to account for higher-order interactions and the nuanced structure pattern inherent in human contact networks. This study introduces a novel Human Contact-Tracing Hypergraph Neural Network framework tailored for epidemic modeling called EpiDHGNN, leveraging the capabilities of hypergraphs to model intricate, higher-order relationships from both location and individual level. Both real-world and synthetic epidemic data are used to train and evaluate the model. Results demonstrate that EpiDHGNN consistently outperforms baseline models across various epidemic modeling tasks, such as source detection and forecast, by effectively capturing the higher-order interactions and preserving the complex structure of human interactions. This work underscores the potential of representing human contact data as hypergraphs and employing hypergraph-based methods to improve epidemic modeling, providing reliable insights for public health decision-making.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Learning and Productivity for Data Analysts: A Bayesian Hidden Markov Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data analysts are essential in organizations, transforming raw data into insights that drive decision-making and strategy. This study explores how analysts' productivity evolves on a collaborative platform, focusing on two key learning activities: writing queries and viewing peer queries. While traditional research often assumes static models, where performance improves steadily with cumulative learning, such models fail to capture the dynamic nature of real-world learning. To address this, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that tracks how analysts transition between distinct learning states based on their participation in these activities.
  Using an industry dataset with 2,001 analysts and 79,797 queries, this study identifies three learning states: novice, intermediate, and advanced. Productivity increases as analysts advance to higher states, reflecting the cumulative benefits of learning. Writing queries benefits analysts across all states, with the largest gains observed for novices. Viewing peer queries supports novices but may hinder analysts in higher states due to cognitive overload or inefficiencies. Transitions between states are also uneven, with progression from intermediate to advanced being particularly challenging. This study advances understanding of into dynamic learning behavior of knowledge worker and offers practical implications for designing systems, optimizing training, enabling personalized learning, and fostering effective knowledge sharing.</description>

      <title>Finding Near-Optimal Maximum Set of Disjoint $k$-Cliques in Real-World Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-clique is a dense graph, consisting of $k$ fully-connected nodes, that finds numerous applications, such as community detection and network analysis. In this paper, we study a new problem, that finds a maximum set of disjoint $k$-cliques in a given large real-world graph with a user-defined fixed number $k$, which can contribute to a good performance of teaming collaborative events in online games. However, this problem is NP-hard when $k \geq 3$, making it difficult to solve. To address that, we propose an efficient lightweight method that avoids significant overheads and achieves a $k$-approximation to the optimal, which is equipped with several optimization techniques, including the ordering method, degree estimation in the clique graph, and a lightweight implementation. Besides, to handle dynamic graphs that are widely seen in real-world social networks, we devise an efficient indexing method with careful swapping operations, leading to the efficient maintenance of a near-optimal result with frequent updates in the graph. In various experiments on several large graphs, our proposed approaches significantly outperform the competitors by up to 2 orders of magnitude in running time and 13.3\% in the number of computed disjoint $k$-cliques, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Local Clustering over Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a seed node $v_s$, the objective of local graph clustering (LGC) is to identify a subgraph $C_s \in G$ (a.k.a. local cluster) surrounding $v_s$ in time roughly linear with the size of $C_s$. This approach yields personalized clusters without needing to access the entire graph, which makes it highly suitable for numerous applications involving large graphs. However, most existing solutions merely rely on the topological connectivity between nodes in $G$, rendering them vulnerable to missing or noisy links that are commonly present in real-world graphs.
  To address this issue, this paper resorts to leveraging the complementary nature of graph topology and node attributes to enhance local clustering quality. To effectively exploit the attribute information, we first formulate the LGC as an estimation of the bidirectional diffusion distribution (BDD), which is specialized for capturing the multi-hop affinity between nodes in the presence of attributes. Furthermore, we propose LACA, an efficient and effective approach for LGC that achieves superb empirical performance on multiple real datasets while maintaining strong locality. The core components of LACA include (i) a fast and theoretically-grounded preprocessing technique for node attributes, (ii) an adaptive algorithm for diffusing any vectors over $G$ with rigorous theoretical guarantees and expedited convergence, and (iii) an effective three-step scheme for BDD approximation. Extensive experiments, comparing 17 competitors on 8 real datasets, show that LACA outperforms all competitors in terms of result quality measured against ground truth local clusters, while also being up to orders of magnitude faster.

      <title>Dynamics of Algorithmic Content Amplification on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent algorithms increasingly shape the content we encounter and engage with online. TikTok's For You feed exemplifies extreme algorithm-driven curation, tailoring the stream of video content almost exclusively based on users' explicit and implicit interactions with the platform. Despite growing attention, the dynamics of content amplification on TikTok remain largely unquantified. How quickly, and to what extent, does TikTok's algorithm amplify content aligned with users' interests? To address these questions, we conduct a sock-puppet audit, deploying bots with different interests to engage with TikTok's "For You" feed. Our findings reveal that content aligned with the bots' interests undergoes strong amplification, with rapid reinforcement typically occurring within the first 200 videos watched. While amplification is consistently observed across all interests, its intensity varies by interest, indicating the emergence of topic-specific biases. Time series analyses and Markov models uncover distinct phases of recommendation dynamics, including persistent content reinforcement and a gradual decline in content diversity over time. Although TikTok's algorithm preserves some content diversity, we find a strong negative correlation between amplification and exploration: as the amplification of interest-aligned content increases, engagement with unseen hashtags declines. These findings contribute to discussions on socio-algorithmic feedback loops in the digital age and the trade-offs between personalization and content diversity.</description>

      <title>From the CDC to emerging infectious disease publics: The long-now of polarizing and complex health crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20262v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention used Twitter to share updates about the virus and safety guidelines, reaching millions instantly, in what we call the CDC public. We analyze two years of tweets, from, to, and about the CDC using a mixed-methods approach to characterize the nature and credibility of COVID-19 discourse and audience engagement. We found that the CDC is not engaging in two-way communication with the CDC publics and that discussions about COVID-19 reflected societal divisions and political polarization. We introduce a crisis message journey concept showing how the CDC public responds to the changing nature of the crisis (e.g., new variants) using ``receipts'' of earlier, and at times contradictory, guidelines. We propose design recommendations to support the CDC in tailoring messages to specific users and publics (e.g., users interested in racial equity) and in managing misinformation, especially in reaction to crisis flashpoints.</description>

      <title>Survey-Based Calibration of the One-Community and Two-Community Social Network Models Used for Testing Singapore's Resilience to Pandemic Lockdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A resilient society is one capable of withstanding and thereafter recovering quickly from large shocks. Brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020--2022, this social resilience is nevertheless difficult to quantify. In this paper, we measured how quickly the Singapore society recovered from the pandemic, by first modeling it as a dynamic social network governed by three processes: (1) random link addition between strangers; (2) social link addition between individuals with a friend in common; and (3) random link deletion . To calibrate this model, we carried out a survey of a representative sample of $N = 2,057$ residents and non-residents in Singapore between Jul and Sep 2022 to measure the numbers of random and social contacts gained over a fixed duration, as well as the number of contacts lost over the same duration, using phone contacts as proxy for social contacts. Lockdown simulations using the model that fits the survey results best suggest that Singapore would recover from such a disruption after 1--2 months.</description>

      <title>CoDiNG -- Naming Game with Continuous Latent Opinions of Individual Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind opinion formation is crucial for gaining insight into the processes that shape political beliefs, cultural attitudes, consumer choices, and social movements. This work aims to explore a nuanced model that captures the intricacies of real-world opinion dynamics by synthesizing principles from cognitive science and employing social network analysis. The proposed model is a hybrid continuous-discrete extension of the well-known Naming Game opinion model. The added latent continuous layer of opinion strength follows cognitive processes in the human brain, akin to memory imprints. The discrete layer allows for the conversion of intrinsic continuous opinion into discrete form, which often occurs when we publicly verbalize our opinions. We evaluated our model using real data as ground truth and demonstrated that the proposed mechanism outperforms the classic Naming Game model in many cases, reflecting that our model is closer to the real process of opinion formation.</description>

      <title>A Discourse Analysis Framework for Legislative and Social Media Debates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we capture the dynamics of deliberation in a debate? In an increasingly divided and misinformed world, understanding the relationship between who is arguing and what they are arguing about is becoming critical for fostering a meaningful exchange of ideas. Given the vast array of available platforms for people to express their viewpoints and deliberate on issues, how can we develop methods to accurately analyze these processes? Luckily, there is an abundance of debate data available, ranging from: (a) formal proceedings, such as committee hearings in legislatures, to (b) online discussion forums, such as Reddit. Here we introduce DALiSM, a data-driven argument-centric framework, to analyze discourse dynamics in diverse and multi-party spaces at scale. We develop methods to harness and extend the state-of-the-art in computational argumentation for: (a) identifying arguments from long-form raw texts, (b) calculating the intensity of deliberation, and (c) modeling the evolution of discourse over time. We deploy our framework as a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for dynamically viewing the outputs of DALiSM to clearly understand the nature of a discourse event. To showcase the importance and utility of DALiSM, we apply our framework to U.S. congressional committee hearings from 2005 to 2023 (109th to 117th Congresses), and to selected Reddit communities from 2008 to 2023. This case study reveals substantive insights into deliberative behavior in online and offline spaces.</description>

      <title>Crowd: A Social Network Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10781</link>

Abstract: To observe how individual behavior shapes a larger community's actions, agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) has been widely adopted by researchers in social sciences, economics, and epidemiology. While simulations can be run on general-purpose ABMS frameworks, these tools are not specifically designed for social networks and, therefore, provide limited features, increasing the effort required for complex simulations. In this paper, we introduce Crowd, a social network simulator that adopts the agent-based modeling methodology to model real-world phenomena within a network environment. Designed to facilitate easy and quick modeling, Crowd supports simulation setup through YAML configuration and enables further customization with user-defined methods. Other features include no-code simulations for diffusion tasks, interactive visualizations, data aggregation, and chart drawing facilities. Designed in Python, Crowd also supports generative agents and connects easily with Python's libraries for data analysis and machine learning. Finally, we include three case studies to illustrate the use of the framework, including generative agents in epidemics, influence maximization, and networked trust games.</description>

      <title>Faces Speak Louder Than Words: Emotions Versus Textual Sentiment in the 2024 USA Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis of textual content has become a well-established solution for analyzing social media data. However, with the rise of images and videos as primary modes of expression, more information on social media is conveyed visually. Among these, facial expressions serve as one of the most direct indicators of emotional content in images. This study analyzes a dataset of Instagram posts related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, spanning April 5, 2024, to August 9, 2024, to compare the relationship between textual and facial sentiment. Our findings reveal that facial expressions align with text sentiment, where positive sentiment aligns with happiness, although neutral and negative facial expressions provide critical information beyond negative valence. Furthermore, during politically significant events such as Donald Trump's conviction and assassination attempt, posts depicting Trump showed a 12% increase in negative sentiment. Crucially, Democrats use their opponent's fear to depict weakness, whereas Republicans use their candidate's anger to depict resilience. Our research highlights the potential of integrating facial expression analysis with textual sentiment analysis to uncover deeper insights into social media dynamics.</description>

      <title>Value of Information in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study extends Blackwell's (1953) comparison of information to a sequential social learning model, where agents make decisions sequentially based on both private signals and the observed actions of others. In this context, we introduce a new binary relation over information structures: an information structure is more socially valuable than another if it yields higher expected payoffs for all agents, regardless of their preferences. First, we establish that this binary relation is strictly stronger than the Blackwell order. Then, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for our binary relation and propose a simpler sufficient condition that is easier to verify.</description>
