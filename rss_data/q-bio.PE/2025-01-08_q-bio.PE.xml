      <title>Fractional modelling of COVID-19 transmission incorporating asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, necessitating effective modelling approaches to understand and control its transmission dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals in a single compartmental model. We highlight the advantages of utilizing incommensurate fractional order derivatives in ordinary differential equations, including increased flexibility in capturing disease dynamics and refined memory effects in the transmission process. We conduct a qualitative analysis of our proposed model, which involves determining the basic reproduction number and analysing the disease-free equilibrium's stability. By fitting the proposed model with real data from Portugal and comparing it with existing models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of supplementary population classes and fractional derivatives significantly improves the model's goodness of fit. Sensitivity analysis further provides valuable insights for designing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Variability: The Impact of Uneven Stochasticity on Competitive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition between species and genotypes is a dominant factor in a variety of ecological and evolutionary processes. Biological dynamics are typically highly stochastic, and therefore, analyzing a competitive system requires accounting for the random nature of birth and death processes (demographic stochasticity) as well as the variability of external conditions (environmental stochasticity). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of species life history, showing that differences in life history lead competing species to experience different levels of demographic stochasticity. Here, we propose a simple model of two-species competition with different life histories and derive analytical expressions for various properties (fixation probability, fixation time, absorption time, probability density) under a wide range of conditions, including migration, selection, and environmental stochasticity. These properties provide insights into the long-term outcomes of competition, such as species persistence, extinction risks, and the influence of environmental variability on the evenness of the community.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the reproduction ratio from epidemic surveillance may be biased in spatially structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of the reproduction ratio are crucial to project infectious disease epidemic evolution and guide public health response. Here, we prove that estimates of the reproduction ratio based on inference from surveillance data can be inaccurate if the population comprises spatially distinct communities, as the space-mobility interplay may hide the true epidemic evolution from surveillance data. Consequently, surveillance may underestimate the reproduction ratio over long periods, even mistaking growing epidemics as subsiding. To address this, we use the spectral properties of the matrix describing the spatial epidemic spread to reweigh surveillance data. We propose a correction that removes the bias across all epidemic phases. We validate this correction against simulated epidemics and use COVID-19 as a case study. However, our results apply to any epidemic where mobility is a driver of circulation. Our findings will help improve epidemic monitoring and surveillance and inform strategies for public health response.</description>

      <title>Multiple Local and Global Bifurcations and Their Role in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quorum sensing governs bacterial communication, playing a crucial role in regulating population behaviour. We propose a mathematical model that uncovers chaotic dynamics within quorum sensing networks, highlighting challenges to predictability. The model explores interactions between autoinducers and two bacterial subtypes, revealing oscillatory dynamics in both a constant autoinducer sub-model and the full three-component model. In the latter case, we find that the complicated dynamics can be explained by the presence of homoclinic Shilnikov bifurcations. We employed a combination of normal form analysis and numerical continuation methods to analyse the system.</description>
