      <title>Comment on Room-temperature spontaneous superradiance from single diamond nanocrystals [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization of translation-invariant systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schr\"odinger's equation and the irreversible entropy growth dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, a complete proof of quantum thermalization has remained elusive for several decades. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions satisfying three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, initially unentangled pure state drawn from any ensemble with maximum entropy becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. Our proof relies on a recent breakthrough in quantum information theory proving the separability of high-temperature thermal states, as well as on new technical results identifying sufficient conditions for quantum thermalization, whose applicability extends beyond our main result. Our work illustrates that statistical physics can be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Connecting extended Wigner's friend arguments and noncontextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Local Friendliness argument is an extended Wigner's friend no-go theorem that provides strong constraints on the nature of reality -- stronger even than those imposed by Bell's theorem or by noncontextuality arguments. In this work, we prove a variety of connections between Local Friendliness scenarios and Kochen-Specker noncontextuality. Specifically, we first show how one can derive new Local Friendliness inequalities using known tools and results from the literature on Kochen-Specker noncontextuality. In doing so, we provide a new derivation for some of the facets of the Local Friendliness polytope, and we prove that this polytope is equal to the Bell polytope in a wide range of extended Wigner's friend scenarios with multipartite agents and sequential measurements. We then show how any possibilistic Kochen-Specker argument can be mathematically translated into a related proof of the Local Friendliness no-go theorem. In particular, we construct a novel kind of Local Friendliness scenario where a friend implements several compatible measurements (or joint measurements of these) in between the superobserver's operations on them. We illustrate this with the well-known 5-cycle and Peres-Mermin contextuality arguments.</description>

      <title>Long distance spin shuttling enabled by few-parameter velocity optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubit shuttling via moving conveyor-mode quantum dots in Si/SiGe offers a promising route to scalable miniaturized quantum computing. Recent modeling of dephasing via valley degrees of freedom and well disorder dictate a slow shutting speed which seems to limit errors to above correction thresholds if not mitigated. We increase the precision of this prediction, showing that typical errors for 10 $\mu$m shuttling at constant speed results in O(1) error, using fast, automatically differentiable numerics and including improved disorder modeling and potential noise ranges. However, remarkably, we show that these errors can be brought to well below fault-tolerant thresholds using trajectory shaping with very simple parametrization with as few as 4 Fourier components, well within the means for experimental in-situ realization, and without the need for targeting or knowing the location of valley near degeneracies.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable interaction with an invertible sign between a fluxonium and a post cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in-situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has not been realized yet. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error Bound for Quantum Machine Learning in NISQ Era -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the mounting anticipation for the quantum revolution, the success of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era hinges on a largely unexplored factor: the generalization error bound, a cornerstone of robust and reliable machine learning models. Current QML research, while exploring novel algorithms and applications extensively, is predominantly situated in the context of noise-free, ideal quantum computers. However, Quantum Circuit (QC) operations in NISQ-era devices are susceptible to various noise sources and errors. In this article, we conduct a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to explore the state-of-the-art generalization bound for supervised QML in NISQ-era and analyze the latest practices in the field. Our study systematically summarizes the existing computational platforms with quantum hardware, datasets, optimization techniques, and the common properties of the bounds found in the literature. We further present the performance accuracy of various approaches in classical benchmark datasets like the MNIST and IRIS datasets. The SMS also highlights the limitations and challenges in QML in the NISQ era and discusses future research directions to advance the field. Using a detailed Boolean operators query in five reliable indexers, we collected 544 papers and filtered them to a small set of 37 relevant articles. This filtration was done following the best practice of SMS with well-defined research questions and inclusion and exclusion criteria.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Observable to Address Noise in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising field that combines the power of quantum computing with the principles of machine learning. One of the significant challenges in QML is dealing with noise in quantum systems, especially in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Noise in quantum systems can introduce errors in quantum computations and degrade the performance of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning observables that are robust against noisy channels in quantum systems. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn observables that remain invariant under the effects of noise and show that this can be achieved through a machine-learning approach. We present a toy example using a Bell state under a depolarization channel to illustrate the concept of robust observables. We then describe a machine-learning framework for learning such observables across six two-qubit quantum circuits and five noisy channels. Our results show that it is possible to learn observables that are more robust to noise than conventional observables. We discuss the implications of this finding for quantum machine learning, including potential applications in enhancing the stability of QML models in noisy environments. By developing techniques for learning robust observables, we can improve the performance and reliability of quantum machine learning models in the presence of noise, contributing to the advancement of practical QML applications in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>Robust and bright polarization-entangled photon sources exploiting non-critical phase matching without periodic poling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon sources are essential for quantum information applications, including quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum metrology. Periodically poled (PP) crystals are commonly used to generate bright photon sources through quasi-phase matching. However, fabricating uniform micron-scale periodic structures poses significant technical difficulties, typically limiting the crystal thickness to less than a millimeter. Here, we adopt non-critical phase matching to produce a robust and bright polarization-entangled photon source based on a Sagnac interferometer. This method is tolerant of variations in pump incidence angles and temperature, and theoretically offers about a 2.5-fold brightness enhancement compared to quasi-phase matching. Additionally, the absence of periodic poling allows for a larger crystal cross-section. Using a bulk KTP crystal without a PP structure, we experimentally produce the four Bell states with a brightness of 25.1 kHz/mW, achieving purity, concurrence, and fidelity values close to 0.99. We believe our scheme will serve as a key building block for scalable and practical photonic quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics as a gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is based on a coarse-grained approach, from which its fundamental variables emerge, effectively erasing the complicate details of the microscopic dynamics within a macroscopic system. The strength of Thermodynamics lies in the universality provided by this paradigm. In contrast, quantum mechanics focuses on describing the dynamics of microscopic systems, aiming to make predictions about experiments we perform, a goal shared by all fundamental physical theories, which are often framed as gauge theories in modern physics. Recently, a gauge theory for quantum thermodynamics was introduced, defining gauge invariant work and heat, and exploring their connections to quantum phenomena. In this work, we extend that theory in two significant ways. First, we incorporate energy spectrum degeneracies, which were previously overlooked. Additionally, we define gauge-invariant entropy, exploring its properties and connections to other physical and informational quantities. This results in a complete framework for quantum thermodynamics grounded in the principle of gauge invariance. To demonstrate some implications of this theory, we apply it to well-known critical systems.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead magic state distillation with color codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, which differ in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme uses faulty T-measurement, offering resource efficiency when the target infidelity is above a certain threshold ($\sim 35p^3$ for physical error rate $p$). To achieve lower infidelities while maintaining resource efficiency, our second scheme exploits a distillation-free fault-tolerant magic state preparation protocol, achieving significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\sim 10^{-19}$ for $p = 10^{-4}$) than the first scheme. Notably, our schemes outperform the best existing magic state distillation methods for color codes by up to about two orders of magnitude in resource costs for a given achievable target infidelity.</description>

      <title>Group delay controlled by the decoherence of a single artificial atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to slow down light at the single-photon level has applications in quantum information processing and other quantum technologies. We demonstrate two methods, both using just a single artificial atom, enabling dynamic control over microwave light velocities in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED). Our methods are based on two distinct mechanisms harnessing the balance between radiative and non-radiative decay rates of a superconducting artificial atom in front of a mirror. In the first method, we tune the radiative decay of the atom using interference effects due to the mirror; in the second method, we pump the atom to control its non-radiative decay through the Autler--Townes effect. When the half the radiative decay rate exceeds the non-radiative decay rate, we observe positive group delay; conversely, dominance of the non-radiative decay rate results in negative group delay. Our results advance signal-processing capabilities in waveguide QED.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Statistical Phase Estimation with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver in the era of Early Fault Tolerant Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we give an overview of the proposed applications in the early-FTQC (EFTQC) era.
  Starting from the error correction architecture for EFTQC device, we first review the recently developed space-time efficient analogue rotation (STAR) architecture \cite{akahoshiPartiallyFaultTolerantQuantum2024}, which is a partially fault-tolerant error correction architecture.
  Then, we review the requirements of an EFTQC algorithm.
  In particular, the class of ground state energy estimation (GSEE) algorithm known as the statistical phase estimation algorithm (SPE) is studied.
  We especially cast our attention on two SPE-type algorithms, the step-function filter-based variant by Lin and Tong (LT22) \cite{Lin:2021rwb} and Gaussian Filter \cite{Wang:2022gxu}.
  Based on the latter, we introduce the Gaussian Fitting algorithm, which uses an alternative post-processing procedure compared to \cite{Wang:2022gxu}.
  Finally, we systematically simulate the aforementioned algorithms and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) using the 1-uCJ ansatz with different shot counts.
  Most importantly, we perform noisy simulations based on the STAR architecture.
  We find that for estimating the ground state energy of the 4-qubit $H_2$ Hamiltonian in the STO-3G basis, SPE becomes more advantageous over VQE when the physical error rate is sufficiently low.</description>

Abstract: Despite many successes of quantum electrodynamics (QED), we do not presently have a good understanding of this field of physics. QED has all of the foundational problems that standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics has, and further ones in addition. I discuss some of these problems and some options for what a Bohm-style theory of QED, with an ontology in space and time, could look like. I also point out why the proposal made by Bohm himself in 1952 for QED is not quite convincing. Finally, I outline the kind of Bohm-type theory of QED that I would consider convincing, and report about recent progress toward this kind of theory.</description>

      <title>C3-VQA: Cryogenic Counter-based Co-processor for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic quantum computers play a leading role in demonstrating quantum advantage. Given the severe constraints on the cooling capacity in cryogenic environments, thermal design is crucial for the scalability of these computers. The sources of heat dissipation include passive inflow via inter-temperature wires and the power consumption of components located in the cryostat, such as wire amplifiers and quantum-classical interfaces. Thus, a critical challenge is to reduce the number of wires by reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth while maintaining minimal additional power consumption in the cryostat. One solution to address this challenge is near-data processing using ultra-low-power computational logic within the cryostat. Based on the workload analysis and domain-specific system design focused on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), we propose the Cryogenic Counter-based Co-processor for VQAs (C3-VQA) to enhance the design scalability of cryogenic quantum computers under the thermal constraint. The C3-VQA utilizes single-flux-quantum logic, which is an ultra-low-power superconducting digital circuit that operates at the 4 K environment. The C3-VQA precomputes a part of the expectation value calculations for VQAs and buffers intermediate values using simple bit operation units and counters in the cryostat, thereby reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth with small additional power consumption. Consequently, the C3-VQA reduces the number of wires, leading to a reduction in the total heat dissipation in the cryostat. Our evaluation shows that the C3-VQA reduces the total heat dissipation at the 4 K stage by 30% and 81% under sequential-shot and parallel-shot execution scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, a case study in quantum chemistry shows that the C3-VQA reduces total heat dissipation by 87% with a 10,000-qubit system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new concept of quantum secret sharing is introduced, in which collaboration among participants are encourage. And the dealer can ask the participants to send back their share and revoke the secret before a predefined date or event, i.e. so-called seal property. We also give two concrete constructions of CE-QSS-Seal (Collaboration-Encouraging Quantum Secret Sharing with Seal property) scheme. The first one is unconditional secure and achieve the optimal bound of a seal scheme. The second one improve the optimal bound of seal by introducing post-quantum secure computational assumption.</description>

      <title>Weaver: A Retargetable Compiler Framework for FPQA Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the prominent quantum computing architectures are based on superconducting technology, new quantum hardware technologies are emerging, such as Trapped Ions, Neutral Atoms (or FPQAs), Silicon Spin Qubits, etc. This diverse set of technologies presents fundamental trade-offs in terms of scalability, performance, manufacturing, and operating expenses. To manage these diverse quantum technologies, there is a growing need for a retargetable compiler that can efficiently adapt existing code to these emerging hardware platforms. Such a retargetable compiler must be extensible to support new and rapidly evolving technologies, performant with fast compilation times and high-fidelity execution, and verifiable through rigorous equivalence checking to ensure the functional equivalence of the retargeted code.
  To this end, we present $Weaver$, the first extensible, performant, and verifiable retargetable quantum compiler framework with a focus on FPQAs due to their unique, promising features. $Weaver$ introduces WQASM, the first formal extension of the standard OpenQASM quantum assembly with FPQA-specific instructions to support their distinct capabilities. Next, $Weaver$ implements the WOptimizer, an extensible set of FPQA-specific optimization passes to improve execution quality. Last, the WChecker automatically checks for equivalence between the original and the retargeted code. Our evaluation shows that $Weaver$ improves compilation times by $10^3\times$, execution times by $4.4\times$, and execution fidelity by $10\%$, on average, compared to superconducting and state-of-the-art (non-retargetable) FPQA compilers.</description>

      <title>Wavevector-resolved polarization entanglement from radiative cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of entangled photons from radiative cascades has enabled milestone experiments in quantum information science with several applications in photonic quantum technologies. Significant efforts are being devoted to pushing the performances of near-deterministic entangled-photon sources based on single quantum emitters often embedded in photonic cavities, so to boost the flux of photon pairs. The general postulate is that the emitter generates photons in a nearly maximally entangled state of polarization, ready for application purposes. Here, we demonstrate that this assumption is unjustified. We show that in radiative cascades there exists an interplay between photon polarization and emission wavevector, strongly affecting quantum correlations when emitters are embedded in micro-cavities. We discuss how the polarization entanglement of photon pairs from a biexciton-exciton cascade in quantum dots strongly depends on their propagation wavevector, and it can even vanish for large emission angles. Our experimental results, backed by theoretical modelling, yield a brand-new understanding of cascaded emission for various quantum emitters. In addition, our model provides quantitative guidelines for designing optical microcavities that retain both a high degree of entanglement and collection efficiency, moving the community one step further towards an ideal source of entangled photons for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exotic localization for the two body bound states in the non-reciprocal Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the localization behavior of two-body Hubbard model in the presence of non-reciprocal tunneling, where the interaction induced Anderson localization competes with the non-Hermitian skin effects and gives rise to diverse patterns of density profiles. Here, we present the non-Hermitian bound states obtained with the center of mass methods in the conditions of strong repulsive interaction, where a faded diagonal line localization is observed. While for the continuum limit, the non-Hermitian skin effects are manifested by non-zero windings of the eigen-energy spectrum. For the moderate interaction strength, it is illustrated that the system possesses multiple Lyapunov exponents due to the competence above and as a consequence, in sharp contrast to the corner localization, the two-body non-Hermitian continuum states can exhibit multiple localization center. By further including two-photon tunneling, topological nontrivial photon bound pairs can be obtained. Finally, the experimental simulations are proposed based on the platforms of the electrical circuit lattices.</description>

      <title>Leveraging non-unital noise for gate-based quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a noise model that ensures the functioning of an echo state network employing a gate-based quantum computer for reservoir computing applications. Energy dissipation induced by amplitude damping drastically improves the short-term memory capacity and expressivity of the network, by simultaneously providing fading memory and richer dynamics. There is an ideal dissipation rate that ensures the best operation of the echo state network around $\gamma\sim$ 0.03. Nevertheless, these beneficial effects are stable as the intensity of the applied noise increases. The improvement of the learning is confirmed by emulating a realistic noise model applied to superconducting qubits, paving the way for the application of reservoir computing methods in current non-fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics strongly restrict the performance of thermal machines. Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive exact generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics for arbitrary, time-periodic, open systems that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties. We demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and a novel athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency of a quantum engine is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Classifying Multipartite Continuous Variable Entanglement Structures through Data-augmented Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum information processing, yet they confront the challenge of generating training datasets with sufficient size and rich diversity, which is particularly acute when dealing with multipartite quantum systems. For instance, in the task of classifying different structures of multipartite entanglement in continuous variable systems, it is necessary to simulate a large number of infinite-dimension state data that can cover as many types of non-Gaussian states as possible. Here, we develop a data-augmented neural network to complete this task with homodyne measurement data. A quantum data augmentation method based on classical data processing techniques and quantum physical principles is proposed to efficiently enhance the network performance. By testing on randomly generated tripartite and quadripartite states, we demonstrate that the network can indicate the entanglement structure among the various partitions and the accuracies are significantly improved with data augmentation. Our approach allows us to further extend the use of data-driven machine learning techniques to more complex tasks of learning quantum systems encoded in a large Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Superior decoy state and purification quantum key distribution protocols for realistic quantum-dot based single photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original proposal of quantum key distribution (QKD) was based on ideal single photon sources, which 40 years later, are still challenging to develop. Therefore, the development of decoy state protocols using weak coherent states (WCS) from lasers, set the frontier in terms of secure key rates. Here, we propose and experimentally emulate two simple-to-implement protocols that allow practical, far from ideal sub-Poissonian photon sources to outperform state-of-the-art WCS. By engineering the photon statistics of a quantum dot's biexciton-exciton cascade, we show that either a truncated decoy state protocol or a heralded purification protocol can be employed to achieve a significantly increased performance in terms of the maximal allowed channel loss for secure key creation, which can exceed that of WCS by more than 3dB. We then show that our recently demonstrated room temperature single photon sources, based on giant colloidal quantum dots coupled to nano-antennas, are already well within the optimal performance range. These protocols can be utilized efficiently on a host of various sub-Poissonian quantum emitters having controllable photon statistics, offering a practical approach to QKD without the hindering requirements on the single photon purity of the photon source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an algorithm for Quantum Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (QIFFT) is developed to work for quantum data. Analogous to a classical discrete signal, a quantum signal can be represented in Dirac notation, application of QIFFT is a tensor transformation from frequency domain to time domain. If the tensors are merely complex entries, then we get the classical scenario. We have included the complete formulation of QIFFT algorithm from the classical model and have included butterfly diagram. QIFFT outperforms regular inversion of Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in terms of computational complexity, quantum parallelism and improved versatility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate anharmonic vibrational polaritons formed due to strong light-matter interactions in an optical cavity between radiation modes and anharmonic vibrations beyond the long-wavelength limit. We introduce a conceptually simple description of light-matter interactions, where spatially localized cavity radiation modes couple to localized vibrations. Within this theoretical framework, we employ self-consistent phonon theory and vibrational dynamical mean-field theory to efficiently simulate momentum-resolved vibrational-polariton spectra, including effects of anharmonicity. Numerical simulations in model systems demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum hacking: Induced-photorefraction attack on a practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a new security loophole in a practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) system, which is opened by the photorefractive effect of lithium niobate-based (LN-based) modulators. By exploiting this loophole, we propose a quantum hacking strategy, i.e., the induced-photorefraction attack, which utilizes the induced photorefraction on the LN-based modulators to hide the classical intercept-resend attack. Specifically, we show that the induced photorefraction can bias the response curve of the LN-based modulator, which will affect the intensity of the modulated signal. Based on the investigation of the channel parameter estimation under above influence, we further analyze the secret key rate of the practical CVQKD system. The simulation results indicate that the communication parties will overestimate the secret key rate, which reveals that Eve can actively open the above loophole by launching the induced-photorefraction attack to successfully obtain the secret key information. To defend against this attack, we can use a random monitoring scheme for modulation variance to determine this attack, and use an improving optical power limiter to effectively mitigate the irradiation beam. Apart from these countermeasures, we also propose using the Sagnac-based IM to stabilize the practical CVQKD system, which can minimize the above effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is a key technology for realizing high-capacity and flexible quantum communication networks. In addition, to realize the emerging quantum internet, quantum frequency conversion is also essential for bridging different quantum systems over optical fiber networks. In this work, we demonstrate a channel-selective quantum frequency conversion (CS-QFC), which allows active selection of the frequency of the converted photon from multiple DWDM channels. The 2.5 THz bandwidth of our CS-QFC system shows the ability to establish a 100-ch DWDM dynamic link from a single quantum system. It promises to increase the diversity of the quantum network.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal coherent state discrimination via continuously labelled non-Gaussian measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state discrimination plays a central role in quantum information and communication. For the discrimination of optical quantum states, the two most widely adopted measurement techniques are photon detection, which produces discrete outcomes, and homodyne detection, which produces continuous outcomes. While various protocols using photon detection have been proposed for optimal and near-optimal discrimination between two coherent states, homodyne detection is known to have higher error rates, with its performance often referred to as the Gaussian limit. In this work, we demonstrate that, despite the fundamental differences between discretely labelled and continuously labelled measurements, continuously labelled non-Gaussian measurements can also achieve near-optimal coherent state discrimination. We explicitly design two coherent state discrimination protocols based on non-Gaussian unitary operations combined with homodyne detection and orthogonal polynomials, which surpass the Gaussian limit. Our results show that photon detection is not required for near-optimal coherent state discrimination and that we can achieve error rates close to the Helstrom bound at low energies with continuously labelled measurements. We also find that our schemes maintain an advantage over the photon detection-based Kennedy receiver for a moderate range of coherent state amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Quantum Key Distribution: A Machine Learning-Based Cascade Protocol Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a pivotal technology in the quest for secure communication, harnessing the power of quantum mechanics to ensure robust data protection. However, scaling QKD to meet the demands of high-speed, real-world applications remains a significant challenge. Traditional key rate determination methods, dependent on complex mathematical models, often fall short in efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose an approach that involves integrating machine learning (ML) techniques with the Cascade error correction protocol to enhance the scalability and efficiency of QKD systems. Our ML-based approach utilizes an autoencoder framework to predict the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and final key length with over 99\% accuracy. This method significantly reduces error correction time, maintaining a consistently low computation time even with large input sizes, such as data rates up to 156 Mbps. In contrast, traditional methods exhibit exponentially increasing computation times as input sizes grow, highlighting the superior scalability of our ML-based solution. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that our method not only accelerates the error correction process but also optimizes resource utilization, making it more cost-effective and practical for real-world deployment. The Cascade protocol's integration further enhances system security by dynamically adjusting error correction based on real-time QBER observations, providing robust protection against potential eavesdropping.
  Our research establishes a new benchmark for scalable, high-throughput QKD systems, proving that machine learning can significantly advance the field of quantum cryptography. This work continues the evolution towards truly scalable quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Scully-Dr\"uhl-type quantum erasers on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum circuit that genuinely implements the Scully-Dr\"uhl-type delayed-choice quantum eraser, where the two recorders of the which-way information directly interact with the signal qubit and remain spatially separated. Experiments conducted on IBM Quantum and IonQ processors demonstrate that the recovery of interference patterns, to varying degrees, aligns closely with theoretical predictions, despite the presence of systematic errors. This quantum circuit-based approach, more manageable and versatile than traditional optical experiments, facilitates arbitrary adjustment of the erasure and enables a true random choice in a genuine delayed-choice manner. On the IBM Quantum platform, delay gates can be employed to further defer the random choice, thereby amplifying the retrocausal effect. Since gate operations are executed sequentially in time, the system does not have any involvement of random choice until after the signal qubit has been measured, therefore eliminating any potential philosophical loopholes regarding retrocausality that might exist in other experimental setups. Remarkably, quantum erasure is achieved with delay times up to $\sim1\,\mu\text{s}$ without noticeable decoherence, a feat challenging to replicate in optical setups.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Resources in Spin-1 Heisenberg Dimer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quantum information resources within bipartite pure and mixed states of the quantum spin-1 Heisenberg dimer system, considering some interesting factors such as the $l_{1}$-norm of quantum coherence, relative coherence, entanglement, and steering, influenced by the magnetic field and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy. Through a thorough investigation, we derive the system's density operator at thermal equilibrium and establish a mathematical framework for analyzing quantum correlation metrics. Our results unveil the system's behavior at absolute zero temperature, revealing quantum antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic phase transitions governed by the magnetic field and anisotropy parameters. We further observe temperature's role in transitioning the system towards classical states, impacting coherence, entanglement, and steering differently. Notably, we find that increasing the exchange anisotropy parameter can reinforce quantum correlations while adjusting the uniaxial single-ion anisotropy parameter influences the system's quantumness, particularly when positive. Some recommendations to maximize quantum coherence, entanglement, and steering involve temperature reduction, increasing the exchange anisotropy parameter, and carefully managing the magnetic field and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy parameter, highlighting the intricate interplay between these factors in maintaining the system's quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Emergent Liouvillian exceptional points from exact principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in exceptional points in open quantum systems. The natural approach in this area has been the use of Markovian master equations. While the resulting Liouvillian EPs have been seen in a variety of systems and have been associated to numerous exotic effects, it is an open question whether such degeneracies and their peculiarities can persist beyond the validity of master equations. In this work, taking the example of a dissipative double-quantum-dot system, we show that Heisenberg equations for our system exhibit the same EPs as the corresponding master equations. To highlight the importance of this finding, we prove that the paradigmatic property associated to EPs - critical damping, persists well beyond the validity of master equations. Our results demonstrate that Liouvillian EPs can arise from underlying fundamental exact principles, rather than merely as a consequence of approximations involved in deriving master equations.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Approach to the Lindbladian Dynamics of a Locally Purified Tensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a valuable framework for implementing Lindbladian dynamics in many-body open quantum systems with nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, a tensor network ansatz known as the Locally Purified Density Operator employs the local purification of the density matrix to guarantee the positivity of the state at all times. Within this framework, the dissipative evolution utilizes the Trotter-Suzuki splitting, yielding a second-order approximation error. However, due to the Lindbladian dynamics' nature, employing higher-order schemes results in non-physical quantum channels. In this work, we leverage the gauge freedom inherent in the Kraus representation of quantum channels to improve the splitting error. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of isometries and find a solution via the second-order trust-region algorithm. We validate our approach using two nearest-neighbor noise models and achieve an improvement of orders of magnitude compared to other positivity-preserving schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method as a compression scheme, helping to control the exponential growth of computational resources, which thus far has limited the use of the locally purified ansatz.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photon Blockade for Nonreciprocal Quantum Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Allocation through a Central Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing a fully functional quantum internet relies on the efficient allocation of multipartite entangled states, which enables advanced quantum communication protocols, secure multipartite quantum key distribution, and distributed quantum computing. In this work, we propose local operations and classical communication (LOCC) protocols for allocating generalized $N$-qubit W and GHZ states within a centralized hub architecture, where the central hub node preshares Bell states with each end node. Our protocols deterministically and exactly distribute these states using only $N$ qubits of quantum memory within the central system, with communication costs of $2N - 2$ and $N$ classical bits for W and GHZ states, respectively. These resource-efficient protocols are further proven to be optimal within the centralized hub architecture, outperforming conventional teleportation protocols for entanglement distribution in both memory and communication costs. Our results provide a more resource-efficient method for allocating essential multipartite entangled states in quantum networks, paving the way for the realization of a quantum internet with enhanced efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian of two isotropic oscillators with weak coupling from an algebraic approach. We write the Hamiltonian of this problem in terms of the boson generators of the $SU(1,1)$ and $SU(2)$ groups. This allows us to apply two tilting transformations based on both group similarity transformations to obtain its energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Then, we obtain the Mandel $Q-$parameter of the photon numbers $n_a$ and $n_b$. It is important to note that in our procedure we consider the case of weak coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the properties of fermionic convolution defined by fermionic Gaussian unitary. A key finding is the purity invariance of pure Gaussian states under this convolution. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient protocol to test the fermionic Gaussianity of pure states by using 3 copies of the input states. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of measures called ``Non-Gaussian Entropy,'' designed to quantify the fermionic non-Gaussianity of states.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the implementation of microwave and mm-wave integrated circuits for control and readout of electron/hole spin qubits, as elementary building blocks for future emerging quantum computing technologies. In particular, it summarizes the most relevant readout and control techniques of electron/hole spin qubits, addresses the feasibility and reports some preliminary simulation results of two blocks: transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and pulse generator (PG). The TIA exhibits a transimpedance gain of 108.5 dB Ohm over a -3dB bandwidth of 18 GHz, with input-referred noise current spectral density of 0.89 pA/root(Hz) at 10 GHz. The PG provides a mm-wave sinusoidal pulse with a minimum duration time of 20 ps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the burgeoning field of quantum computing, the precise design and optimization of quantum pulses are essential for enhancing qubit operation fidelity. This study focuses on refining the pulse engineering techniques for superconducting qubits, employing a detailed analysis of Square and Gaussian pulse envelopes under various approximation schemes. We evaluated the effects of coherent errors induced by naive pulse designs. We identified the sources of these errors in the Hamiltonian model's approximation level. We mitigated these errors through adjustments to the external driving frequency and pulse durations, thus, implementing a pulse scheme with stroboscopic error reduction. Our results demonstrate that these refined pulse strategies improve performance and reduce coherent errors. Moreover, the techniques developed herein are applicable across different quantum architectures, such as ion-trap, atomic, and photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how III-V semiconductor microring resonators can efficiently generate photon pairs and squeezed vacuum states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion by utilizing their built-in quasi phase matching and modal dispersion. We present an analytic expression for the biphoton wave function of photon pairs generated by weak pump pulses, and characterize the squeezed states that result under stronger pumping conditions. Our model includes loss, and captures the statistics of the scattered photons. A detailed sample calculation shows that for low pump powers conversion efficiencies of 10$^{-5}$, corresponding to a rate of 39 MHz for a pump power of 1 $\mu$W, are attainable for rudimentary structures such as a simple microring coupled to a waveguide, in both the continuous wave and pulsed excitation regimes. Our results suggest that high levels of squeezing and pump depletion are attainable, possibly leading to the deterministic generation of non-Gaussian states</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithmic Quantum and Classical Simulations by Corrected Product Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation using product formulas is arguably the most straightforward and practical approach for algorithmic simulation of a quantum system's dynamics on a quantum computer. Here we present corrected product formulas (CPFs), a variation of product formulas achieved by injecting auxiliary terms called correctors into standard product formulas. We establish several correctors that greatly improve the accuracy of standard product formulas for simulating Hamiltonians comprised of two partitions that can be exactly simulated, a common feature of lattice Hamiltonians, while only adding a small additive or multiplicative factor to the simulation cost. We show that correctors are particularly advantageous for perturbed systems, where one partition has a relatively small norm compared to the other, as they allow the small norm to be utilized as an additional parameter for controlling the simulation error. We demonstrate the performance of CPFs by numerical simulations for several lattice Hamiltonians. Numerical results show our theoretical error bound for CPFs matches or exceeds the empirical error of standard product formulas for these systems. CPFs could be a valuable algorithmic tool for early fault-tolerant quantum computers with limited computing resources. As for standard product formulas, CPFs could also be used for simulations on a classical computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10497v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of the Sagnac effect for massive material particles offers a significant enhancement in sensitivity when compared to optical interferometers with equal area and angular rotation velocity. For this reason, there have been suggestions to employ solid-state interferometers that rely on semiconductors and graphene. We investigate the Sagnac effect in Dirac materials governed by the relativisticlike quasiparticle dispersion law and show that the fringe shift is still determined by the mass of a free electron. This confirms that graphene is indeed a promising material for creating solid-state Sagnac interferometers. Considering monolayer graphene with its linear dispersion law and comparing it with light provides a deeper understanding of the Sagnac effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20225v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a Hamiltonian lattice formulation for 2+1D compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is derived. We analytically solve this theory and demonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known continuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the quantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates, the non-trivial properties of Wilson loops, and the mutual and self statistics of anyons. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based simulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Developing a Framework for Sonifying Variational Quantum Algorithms: Implications for Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter examines the Variational Quantum Harmonizer, a software tool and musical interface that focuses on the problem of sonification of the minimization steps of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), used for simulating properties of quantum systems and optimization problems assisted by quantum hardware. Particularly, it details the sonification of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using VQA. A flexible design enables its future applications both as a sonification tool for auditory displays in scientific investigation, and as a hybrid quantum-digital musical instrument for artistic endeavours. In turn, sonification can help researchers understand complex systems better and can serve for the training of quantum physics and quantum computing. The VQH structure, including its software implementation, control mechanisms, and sonification mappings are detailed. Moreover, it guides the design of QUBO cost functions in VQH as a music compositional object. The discussion is extended to the implications of applying quantum-assisted simulation in quantum-computer aided composition and live-coding performances. An artistic output is showcased by the piece \textit{Hexagonal Chambers} (Thomas and Itabora\'i, 2023).</description>

      <title>A compact QUBO encoding of computational logic formulae demonstrated on cryptography constructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to advance the state-of-the-art in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation with a focus on cryptography algorithms. As the minimal QUBO encoding of the linear constraints of optimization problems emerges as the solution of integer linear programming (ILP) problems, by solving special boolean logic formulas (like ANF and DNF) for their integer coefficients it is straightforward to handle any normal form, or any substitution for multi-input AND, OR or XOR operations in a QUBO form. To showcase the efficiency of the proposed approach we considered the most widespread cryptography algorithms including AES-128/192/256, MD5, SHA1 and SHA256. For each of these, we achieved QUBO instances reduced by thousands of logical variables compared to previously published results, while keeping the QUBO matrix sparse and the magnitude of the coefficients low. In the particular case of AES-256 cryptography function we obtained more than 8x reduction in variable count compared to previous results. The demonstrated reduction in QUBO sizes notably increases the vulnerability of cryptography algorithms against future quantum annealers, capable of embedding around $30$ thousands of logical variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic driving of systems of particles can create crystalline structures in time. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical systems and to realize photonic time crystals by periodic temporal modulation of the material properties of the electromagnetic wave propagation medium. We introduce here a versatile averaged-permittivity approach which empowers emulating various condensed matter phases in the time dimension in a traveling wave resonator. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of permittivity within a small segment of the resonator and the spatial shape of the segment. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable, opening a pathway for research into the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time utilising microwave and optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero energy eigenstates $\psi_0(\theta)$ of the twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonian at the Dirac point show a high sensitivity to the twist angle $\theta$ near the magic angles where the effective Fermi velocity vanishes. We use information theory markers, like fidelity-susceptibility and entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix to the layer sector, to capture this quantum criticality of zero modes at magic twist angles.</description>

      <title>QED Corrections in Unstable Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-energy and vacuum polarization effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) are calculated for the supercritical Coulomb field, where Dirac energy levels become embedded in the negative-energy continuum. In this regime, the quantum vacuum becomes unstable, resulting in spontaneous electron-positron pair creation. By calculating the imaginary part of the QED correction, we gain access to an unexplored channel of vacuum instability: radiative spontaneous pair creation. Our results show that this radiative channel is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the threshold of the supercritical regime, providing evidence for nonperturbative effects with respect to the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. We therefore conjecture that the total probability of spontaneous pair creation could differ significantly from the predictions of Dirac theory, especially near the supercritical threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries, stemming from the projective algebra of synthetic gauge fields, can modify the manifold of the Brillouin zone and lead to a variety of topological phenomena. We present an acoustic realization of higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) protected by a pair of anticommutative momentum-space glide reflections. We confirm the presence of momentum-space glide reflection from the measured momentum half translation of edge bands and their momentum-resolved probability distribution using a cylinder geometry made of acoustic resonator arrays. In particular, we observe both intrinsic and extrinsic HOTI features in such a cylinder: hopping strength variation along the open boundary leads to a bulk gap closure, while that along the closed boundary results in an edge gap closure. In addition, we confirm the presence of quadrupole corner modes with transmission and field distribution measurements. Our observation enriches the study of topological physics of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Experimental error suppression in Cross-Resonance gates via multi-derivative pulse shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum circuits are reaching impressive widths in the hundreds of qubits, their depths have not been able to keep pace. In particular, cloud computing gates on multi-qubit, fixed-frequency superconducting chips continue to hover around the 1% error range, contrasting with the progress seen on carefully designed two-qubit chips, where error rates have been pushed towards 0.1%. Despite the strong impetus and a plethora of research, experimental demonstration of error suppression on these multi-qubit devices remains challenging, primarily due to the wide distribution of qubit parameters and the demanding calibration process required for advanced control methods. Here, we achieve this goal, using a simple control method based on multi-derivative, multi-constraint pulse shaping, which acts simultaneously against multiple error sources. Our approach establishes a two to fourfold improvement on the default calibration scheme, demonstrated on four qubits on the IBM Quantum Platform with limited and intermittent access, enabling these large-scale fixed-frequency systems to fully take advantage of their superior coherence times. The achieved CNOT fidelities of 99.7(1)% on those publically available qubits come from both coherent control error suppression and accelerated gate time.</description>

Abstract: Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset superconducting qubits to near their ground states, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Making sense of relativistic Wigner friend scenarios: a problem for unitary accounts of quantum measurements ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wigner-friend scenarios -- in which external agents describe a closed laboratory containing a friend making a measurement -- highlight the difficulties inherent to quantum theory when accounting for measurements. In non-relativistic scenarios, the difficulty is to accommodate unitary evolution for a closed system with a definite outcome obtained by the friend. In relativistic scenarios the tensions between quantum theory and relativity induce additional constraints. A generic property of relativistic scenarios is the frame-dependence of state update upon a measurement. Based on a definite example, we will show that this property leads to inconsistent accounts for outcomes obtained in different reference frames. We will further argue that these results point to some fundamental inadequacy when attempting to model actions taken by a complex agent as unitary operations made on simple wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Q-Pilot: Field Programmable Qubit Array Compilation with Flying Ancillas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have become a promising platform for quantum computing, especially the field programmable qubit array (FPQA) endowed with the unique capability of atom movement. This feature allows dynamic alterations in qubit connectivity during runtime, which can reduce the cost of executing long-range gates and improve parallelism. However, this added flexibility introduces new challenges in circuit compilation. Inspired by the placement and routing strategies for FPGAs, we propose to map all data qubits to fixed atoms while utilizing movable atoms to route for 2-qubit gates between data qubits. Coined flying ancillas, these mobile atoms function as ancilla qubits, dynamically generated and recycled during execution. We present Q-Pilot, a scalable compiler for FPQA employing flying ancillas to maximize circuit parallelism. For two important quantum applications, quantum simulation and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we devise domain-specific routing strategies. In comparison to alternative technologies such as superconducting devices or fixed atom arrays, Q-Pilot effectively harnesses the flexibility of FPQA, achieving reductions of 1.4x, 27.7x, and 6.3x in circuit depth for 100-qubit random, quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Parametric Amplification in Raman-Cavity Hybrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric resonances and amplification have led to extraordinary photoinduced phenomena in pump-probe experiments. While these phenomena manifest themselves in out-of-equilibrium settings, here, we present the striking result of parametric amplification in equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that quantum and thermal fluctuations of a Raman-active mode amplifies light inside a cavity, at equilibrium, when the Raman mode frequency is twice the cavity mode frequency. This noise-driven amplification leads to the creation of an unusual parametric Raman polariton, intertwining the Raman mode with cavity squeezing fluctuations, with smoking gun signatures in Raman spectroscopy. In the resonant regime, we show the emergence of not only quantum light amplification but also localization and static shift of the Raman mode. Apart from the fundamental interest of equilibrium parametric amplification our study suggests a resonant mechanism for controlling Raman modes and thus matter properties by cavity fluctuations. We conclude by outlining how to compute the Raman-cavity coupling, and suggest possible experimental realization</description>

      <title>Lightcone Bounds for Quantum Circuit Mapping via Uncomplexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently mapping quantum circuits onto hardware is an integral part of the quantum compilation process, wherein a circuit is modified in accordance with the stringent architectural demands of a quantum processor. Many techniques exist for solving the quantum circuit mapping problem, in addition to several theoretical perspectives that relate quantum circuit mapping to problems in classical computer science. This work considers a novel perspective on quantum circuit mapping, in which the routing process of a simplified circuit is viewed as a composition of quantum operations acting on density matrices representing the quantum circuit and processor. Drawing on insight from recent advances in quantum circuit complexity and information geometry, we show that a minimal SWAP-gate count for executing a quantum circuit on a device emerges via the minimization of the distance between quantum states using the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, which we dub the lightcone bound. Additionally, we develop a novel initial placement algorithm based on a graph similarity search that selects the partition nearest to a graph isomorphism between interaction and coupling graphs. From these two ingredients, we construct an algorithm for calculating the lightcone bound, which is directly compared alongside the IBM Qiskit compiler for over $600$ realistic benchmark experiments, as well as against a brute-force method for smaller benchmarks. In our simulations, we unambiguously find that neither the brute-force method nor the Qiskit compiler surpasses our bound, signaling utility for estimating minimal overhead when realizing quantum algorithms on constrained quantum hardware. This work also constitutes the first use of quantum circuit uncomplexity to practically-relevant quantum computing. We anticipate that this method may have diverse applicability outside of the scope of quantum information science.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for embedding continuous variables into quantum circuits via piecewise polynomial features, utilizing low-rank tensor networks. Our approach, termed Piecewise Polynomial Tensor Network Quantum Feature Encoding (PPTNQFE), aims to broaden the applicability of quantum algorithms by incorporating spatially localized representations suited for numerical applications like partial differential equations and function regression. We demonstrate the potential of PPTNQFE through efficient point evaluations of solutions of discretized differential equations and in modeling functions with localized features such as jump discontinuities. While promising, challenges such as unexplored noise impact and design of trainable circuits remain. This study opens new avenues for enhancing quantum models with novel feature embeddings and leveraging TN representations for a wider array of function types in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that, for any fixed dimension, our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\mathtt{tol}$ with an optimal complexity of order $\mathtt{tol}^{-1}$ up to logarithmic terms, significantly improving over existing approaches. Notably, this approach does not rely on regularity of the solution and achieves quantum advantage over classical solvers in two dimensions, whereas prior quantum methods required at least four dimensions for asymptotic benefits. We further detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, present simulator results, and report numerical experiments on current quantum hardware, confirming the feasibility of preconditioned finite element methods for near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations affect the functionality of nanodevices. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), derived within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, show that a minimal amount of dissipation is required to obtain a given relative energy current dispersion, that is, current precision has a thermodynamic cost. It is therefore of great interest to explore the possibility that TURs are violated, particularly for quantum systems, leading to accurate currents at lower cost. Here, we show that two quantum harmonic oscillators are synchronized by coupling to a common thermal environment, at strong dissipation and low temperature. In this regime, periodically modulated couplings to a second thermal reservoir, breaking time-reversal symmetry and taking advantage of non-Markovianity of this latter reservoir, lead to strong violation of TURs for local work currents, while maintaining finite output power. Our results pave the way for the use of synchronization in the thermodynamics of precision.</description>

Abstract: The study focuses on strategic-form games extended in the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein scheme by two unitary operations. Conditions are determined under which the pair of unitary operators, along with classical strategies, form a game invariant under isomorphic transformations of the input classical game. These conditions are then applied to determine these operators, resulting in five main classes of games satisfying the isomorphism criterion, and a theorem is proved providing a practical criterion for this isomorphism. The interdependencies between different classes of extensions are identified, including limit cases in which one class transforms into another.</description>

      <title>Coherent feedback control for cavity optomechanical systems with a frequency-dependent mirror</title>

Abstract: Ground-state cooling of mechanical resonators is a prerequisite for the observation of various quantum effects in optomechanical systems and thus has always been a crucial task in quantum optomechanics. In this paper, we study how to realize ground-state cooling of the mechanical mode in a Fano-mirror optomechanical setup, which allows for enhanced effective optomechanical interaction but typically works in the (deeply) unresolved-sideband regime. We reveal that for such a two-sided cavity geometry with very different decay rates at the two cavity mirrors, it is possible to cool the mechanical mode down to its ground state within a broad range of parameters by using an appropriate single-sided coherent feedback. This is possible even if the total optical loss is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical frequency and the feedback efficiency is relatively low. Importantly, we show that a more standard double-sided feedback scheme is not appropriate to cooperate with a Fano-mirror system.</description>

      <title>Non-Unitary Quantum Many-Body Dynamics using the Faber Polynomial Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <title>Single Bell inequality to detect genuine nonlocality in three-qubit genuinely entangled states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether every pure multipartite state that is genuinely entangled is also genuinely nonlocal. Recently, a new general construction of Bell inequalities allowing the detection of genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) in quantum states was proposed in [F. J. Curchod, M. L. Almeida, and A. Acin, New J. Phys. 21, 023016 (2019) with the aim of addressing the above problem. Here we show how, in a simple manner, one can improve this construction to deliver tighter Bell inequalities for detection of GMNL. Remarkably, we then prove one of the improved Bell inequalities to be powerful enough to detect GMNL in every three-qubit genuinely entangled state. We also generalize some of these inequalities to detect not only GMNL but also nonlocality depth in multipartite states and we present a possible way of generalizing them to the case of more outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon pairs generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion are a well-established method to realize entangled bipartite photonic systems. Laguerre-Gaussian modes, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), are commonly exploited to engineer high-dimensional entangled quantum states. %experimentally. For Hilbert spaces with dimension d&gt;2, maximally entangled states (MESs) help to improve the capacity and security of quantum communication protocols, among several other promising features. However, the direct generation of MES in well-defined high-dimensional subspaces of the infinite OAM basis has remained a challenge. Here, we formalize how the spatial distribution of the pump beam and the nonlinear profile of the crystal can be simultaneously utilized to generate MES without additional spatial filtering of OAM modes within a subspace. We illustrate our approach with maximally entangled qutrits (d=3) and ququints (d=5).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study the analogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Machine Learning: The Power of Non-Linear Optical Reproducing Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amidst the array of quantum machine learning algorithms, the quantum kernel method has emerged as a focal point, primarily owing to its compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and its promise to achieve quantum advantage. This method operates by nonlinearly transforming data into feature space constructed with quantum states, enabling classification and regression tasks. In this study, we present a novel feature space constructed using Kerr coherent states, which generalize su(2), su(1, 1) coherent states, and squeezed states. Notably, the feature space exhibits constant curvature, comprising both spherical and hyperbolic geometries, depending on the sign of the Kerr parameter. Remarkably, the physical parameters associated with the coherent states, enable control over the curvature of the feature space. Our study employs Kerr kernels derived from encoding data into the phase and amplitude of Kerr coherent states. We analyze various datasets ranging from Moon to breast cancer diagnostics. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of Kerr coherent states, attributed to their flexibility in accommodating different hyperparameters, thereby offering superior performance across noisy datasets and hardware setups.</description>

      <title>Operator space fragmentation in perturbed Floquet-Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p &lt; 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: Drug discovery and development is a highly complex and costly endeavor, typically requiring over a decade and substantial financial investment to bring a new drug to market. Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising candidate for various quantum applications, such as quantum sensing. High sensitivity in NV-based magnetic sensing requires a diamond sample with a high density of NV centers and a long electron spin dephasing time. In this work, we propose a systematic measurement method for determining the electron spin dephasing time of NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions to the dephasing time from various sources, including NV-NV interactions, strain distribution, $^{13}C$ nuclear spin, and P1 electron spin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a series of high-performance diamond samples and provide a comprehensive understanding of dephasing sources, enabling the optimization of NV-based quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report temperature measurements using a transmon qubit by detecting the population of the first three levels of it, after employing a sequence of $\pi$-pulses and performing projective dispersive readout. We measure the effective temperature of the qubit and characterize its relaxation and coherence times $\tau_{1,2}$ for three devices in the temperature range 20-300 mK. Signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the temperature measurement depends strongly on $\tau_{1}$, which drops at higher temperatures due to quasiparticle excitations, adversely affecting the measurements and setting an upper bound of the dynamic temperature range of the thermometer. The measurement relies on coherent dynamics of the qubit during the $\pi$-pulses. The effective qubit temperature follows closely that of the cryostat in the range 100-250 mK. We present a numerical model of the qubit population distribution and compare it favorably with the experimental results.</description>

Abstract: The manipulation and transformation of quantum resources are key parts of quantum mechanics. Among them, asymmetry is one of the most useful operational resources, which is widely used in quantum clocks, quantum metrology, and other tasks. Recent studies have shown that the asymmetry of quantum states can be significantly amplified with the assistance of correlating catalysts which are finite-dimensional auxiliaries. In the experiment, we perform translationally invariant operations, ensuring that the asymmetric resources of the entire system remain non-increasing, on a composite system composed of a catalytic system and a quantum system. The experimental results demonstrate an asymmetry amplification of 0.0172\pm0.0022 in the system following the catalytic process. Our work showcases the potential of quantum catalytic processes and is expected to inspire further research in the field of quantum resource theories.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method enhances optimization in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by incorporating geometric insights from the quantum state space through the Fubini-Study metric. In this work, we extend QNG by introducing higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections using the Riemannian Euler update rule and geodesic equations, deriving an updated rule for the Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Correction (QNGGC). We also develop an efficient method for computing the Christoffel symbols necessary for these corrections, leveraging the parameter-shift rule to enable direct measurement from quantum circuits. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, we demonstrate that QNGGC significantly improves convergence rates over standard QNG, highlighting the benefits of integrating geodesic corrections into quantum optimization processes. Our approach paves the way for more efficient quantum algorithms, leveraging the advantages of geometric methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are highly effective at manipulating classical light in the linear regime; however, effectively controlling the polarization of non-classical light generated from nonlinear resonant metasurfaces remains a challenge. Here, we present a solution by achieving polarization engineering of frequency-nondegenerate biphotons emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in GaAs metasurfaces, where quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) resonances were utilized for boosting the biphoton generation. By performing a comprehensive polarization tomography, we demonstrate that the polarization of the emitted photons directly reflects the qBIC mode's far-field properties. Furthermore, we show that both the type of qBIC mode and the symmetry of the meta-atoms can be tailored to control each single-photon polarization state, and that the subsequent two-photon polarization states are nearly separable, offering potential applications in the heralded generation of single photons with adjustable polarization. This work provides a significant step towards utilizing metasurfaces to not only generate quantum light but also engineer their polarization, a critical aspect for future quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Despite the extensive study of matter-wave superradiance in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using its unique coherence property, the controllability of superradiant process has remained limited in the previous studies exploiting a phase-coherent condensate with isotropic contact interactions. Here, we combine tunable s-wave scattering with dipolar interactions in a BEC of $^{168}$Er atoms wherein the asymmetry and threshold of superradiance are independently controlled. By changing the s-wave scattering length near the Feshbach resonance, we tune the superradiance threshold with increasing phase fluctuations. In contrast to collective light scattering from a condensate only with contact interactions, we observe an asymmetric superradiant peak in a dipolar BEC by changing the direction of external magnetic field. This results from the anisotropic excitation spectrum induced by the dipole-dipole interaction. Our observation is expected to bring forth unprecedented application of matter-wave optics leading to controlled emission of matter wave.</description>

Abstract: Particle decays do not constitute a spin ``measurement'' in the quantum-mechanical sense, but still modify the spin state, in particular for an entangled system. We show that for a spin-entangled pair of particles the entanglement of the system can increase after the decay of one particle. This unique phenomenon has no equivalent for stable particles and could be observable in top pair production at a high-energy polarized $e^+ e^-$ collider.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we found that AFM coupling appears at the YIG/Py interface of the tetrahedral YIG surface formed with ion milling. The STEM measurements suggest that the interfacial AFM coupling is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism, which is confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be energetically favorable. Thus, the combined experimental and theoretical results reveal the critical role of interfacial atomic structure in determining the type magnetic coupling in a YIG/ferromagnet heterostructure, and prove that the interfacial structure can be experimentally tuned by surface ion-milling.</description>

      <title>Breaking and trapping Cooper pairs by Rydberg-molecule spectroscopy in atomic Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a spectroscopic probe of the breaking and localization of Cooper pairs in an atomic Fermi superfluid interacting with a Rydberg impurity. This is achieved by monitoring the formation of diatomic and triatomic ultralong-range molecular species in the superfluid across the BCS - Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. The triatomic Rydberg molecule in the BEC regime heralds the trapping of a tightly-bound Cooper pair, reminiscent of pion capture in nuclear matter, while the breaking of a Cooper pair on the BCS side by a diatomic Rydberg molecule is evocative of binary-star tidal disruption by a black hole. Spectroscopy of the Fermi superfluid and Rydberg molecules allows for an estimation of the Cooper-pair size while the Rydberg molecule binding energies discern many-body pairing effects.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and chaos in deformed SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently been proposed as a quantum probe of chaos. The Krylov exponent characterising the exponential growth of Krylov complexity is conjectured to upper-bound the Lyapunov exponent. We compute the Krylov and the Lyapunov exponents in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and in some of its deformations. We do this analysis both at infinite and finite temperatures, in models where the number of fermionic interactions is both finite and infinite. We consider deformations that interpolate between two regions of near-maximal chaos and deformations that become nearly-integrable at low temperatures. In all cases, we find that the Krylov exponent upper-bounds the Lyapunov one. However, we find that while the Lyapunov exponent can have non-monotonic behaviour as a function of temperature, in all studied examples the Krylov exponent behaves monotonically. For instance, we find models where the Lyapunov exponent goes to zero at low temperatures, while the Krylov exponent saturates to its maximal bound. We speculate on the possibility that this monotonicity might be a generic feature of the Krylov exponent in quantum systems evolving under unitary evolution.</description>

      <title>Sparsity dependence of Krylov state complexity in the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Krylov state complexity of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for $N \le 28$ Majorana fermions with $q$-body fermion interaction with $q=4,6,8$ for a range of sparse parameter $k$. Using the peak of the Krylov complexity as a probe, we find change in behavior as we vary $k$ for various $q$. We argue that this captures the change from holographic to non-holographic behavior in the sparse SYK-type models such that model is holographic for all $k \ge k_{\text{min}}$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for simple "arrow of time functions" in closed chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.</description>
