      <title>A wideband amplifying and filtering reconfigurable intelligent surface for wireless relay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable metasurfaces have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves in real time, leading to the emergence of a prominent area in wireless communication, namely reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to control the signal propagation and coverage. However, the existing RISs usually suffer from limited operating distance and band interference, which hinder their practical applications in wireless relay and communication systems. To overcome the limitations, we propose an amplifying and filtering RIS (AF-RIS) to enhance the in-band signal energy and filter the out-of-band signal of the incident EM waves, ensuring the miniaturization of the RIS array and enabling its anti-interference ability. In addition, each AF-RIS element is equipped with a 2-bit phase control capability, further endowing the entire array with great beamforming performance. An elaborately designed 4*8 AF-RIS array is presented by integrating the power dividing and combining networks, which substantially reduces the number of amplifiers and filters, thereby reducing the hardware costs and power consumption. Experimental results showcase the powerful capabilities of AF-RIS in beam-steering, frequency selectivity, and signal amplification. Therefore, the proposed AF-RIS holds significant promise for critical applications in wireless relay systems by offering an efficient solution to improve frequency selectivity, enhance signal coverage, and reduce hardware size.</description>

      <title>VERITAS: Verifying the Performance of AI-native Transceiver Actions in Base-Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native receivers prove significant performance improvement in high noise regimes and can potentially reduce communication overhead compared to the traditional receiver. However, their performance highly depends on the representativeness of the training dataset. A major issue is the uncertainty of whether the training dataset covers all test environments and waveform configurations, and thus, whether the trained model is robust in practical deployment conditions. To this end, we propose a joint measurement-recovery framework for AI-native transceivers post deployment, called VERITAS, that continuously looks for distribution shifts in the received signals and triggers finite re-training spurts. VERITAS monitors the wireless channel using 5G pilots fed to an auxiliary neural network that detects out-of-distribution channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread. As soon as such a change is detected, a traditional (reference) receiver is activated, which runs for a period of time in parallel to the AI-native receiver. Finally, VERTIAS compares the bit probabilities of the AI-native and the reference receivers for the same received data inputs, and decides whether or not a retraining process needs to be initiated. Our evaluations reveal that VERITAS can detect changes in the channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread with 99%, 97%, and 69% accuracies, respectively, followed by timely initiation of retraining for 86%, 93.3%, and 94.8% of inputs in channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread test sets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Ultra-Reliable Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of 5G and 6G networks, the demands extend beyond high data rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive coverage, increasingly emphasizing the need for reliability. This paper proposes an ultra-reliable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme utilizing quasi-orthogonal space-time block coding (QOSTBC) combined with singular value decomposition (SVD) for channel state information (CSI) correction, significantly improving performance over QOSTBC and traditional orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) when analyzing spectral efficiency. Although QOSTBC enhances spectral efficiency, it also increases computational complexity at the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. To address this, a neural network-based decoding scheme using phase-transmittance radial basis function (PT-RBF) architecture is also introduced to manage QOSTBC's complexity. Simulation results demonstrate improved system robustness and performance, making this approach a potential candidate for ultra-reliable communication in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Modulation Scheme Based on the Kramers--Kronig Relations for Optical IM/DD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing demand for higher data rates in optical communication systems necessitates the development of advanced modulation formats capable of significantly enhancing system performance. In this work, we propose a novel modulation format derived from the Kramers--Kronig relations. This scheme effectively reduces the complexity of digital filtering and alleviates the demands on the digital-to-analog converter, offering a practical solution for high speed optical communication. The proposed modulation format was rigorously validated through experimental investigations using an optical wireless link. The results demonstrate a notable improvement in bit error rate (BER) performance and receiver sensitivity compared to PAM-4 and CAP-16 modulation schemes, with enhancements of 0.6 dB and 1.5 dB in receiver sensitivity, respectively. These improvements enable higher data transmission rates, positioning the Kramers--Kronig relations-based modulation format as a promising alternative to existing modulation techniques. Its potential to enhance the efficiency and capacity of optical communication systems is clearly evident. Future work will focus on extending its application to more complex scenarios, such as high-speed underwater optical communication systems, where advanced modulation formats are critical for overcoming bandwidth limitations.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Distributed Beamforming Design in Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating radio-sensing functionalities into future cell-free (CF) wireless networks promises efficient resource utilization and facilitates the seamless roll-out of applications such as public safety and smart infrastructure. While the beamforming design problem for the CF integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm has been addressed in the literature, existing methods rely on centralized signal processing, leading to fronthaul load and scalability issues. This paper presents a two-stage beamforming design for the CF ISAC paradigm, aiming to significantly reduce the fronthaul load by distributing the signal processing tasks between the central unit (CU) and the access points (APs). The design optimizes the sum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for communication users, subject to per-AP power constraints and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for radio-sensing purposes. The resulting optimization problems are non-convex and challenging to solve. To address this, we employ a majorization-minimization (MM) approach, which decomposes the problem into simpler convex subproblems. The results show that the two-stage beamforming design achieves performance comparable to centralized methods while substantially reducing the fronthaul load, thus minimizing data transmission requirements over the fronthaul network. This advancement highlights the potential of the proposed method to enhance the efficiency and scalability of cell-free MIMO ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>A scalable event-driven spatiotemporal feature extraction circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-driven sensors, which produce data only when there is a change in the input signal, are increasingly used in applications that require low-latency and low-power real-time sensing, such as robotics and edge devices. To fully achieve the latency and power advantages on offer however, similarly event-driven data processing methods are required. A promising solution is the TDE: an event-based processing element which encodes the time difference between events on different channels into an output event stream. In this work we introduce a novel TDE implementation on CMOS. The circuit is robust to device mismatch and allows the linear integration of input events. This is crucial for enabling a high-density implementation of many TDEs on the same die, and for realising real-time parallel processing of the high-event-rate data produced by event-driven sensors.</description>

      <title>Implementing Finite Impulse Response Filters on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While signal processing is a mature area, its connections with quantum computing have received less attention. In this work, we propose approaches that perform classical discrete-time signal processing using quantum systems. Our approaches encode the classical discrete-time input signal into quantum states, and design unitaries to realize classical concepts of finite impulse response (FIR) filters. We also develop strategies to cascade lower-order filters to realize higher-order filters through designing appropriate unitary operators. Finally, a few directions for processing quantum states on classical systems after converting them to classical signals are suggested for future work.</description>

      <title>Robust Egoistic Rigid Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a robust and self-reliant (or "egoistic") variation of the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which a primary rigid body seeks to estimate the pose (i.e., location and orientation) of another rigid body (or "target"), relative to its own, without the assistance of external infrastructure, without prior knowledge of the shape of the target, and taking into account the possibility that the available observations are incomplete. Three complementary contributions are then offered for such a scenario. The first is a method to estimate the translation vector between the center point of both rigid bodies, which unlike existing techniques does not require that both objects have the same shape or even the same number of landmark points. This technique is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art (SotA) under complete information, but to be sensitive to data erasures, even when enhanced by matrix completion methods. The second contribution, designed to offer improved performance in the presence of incomplete information, offers a robust alternative to the latter, at the expense of a slight relative loss under complete information. Finally, the third contribution is a scheme for the estimation of the rotation matrix describing the relative orientation of the target rigid body with respect to the primary. Comparisons of the proposed schemes and SotA techniques demonstrate the advantage of the contributed methods in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) performance under fully complete information and incomplete conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Optimization for Beyond Diagonal RIS-aided Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from its capability to generalize existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures and provide additional design flexibility via interactions between RIS elements, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has attracted considerable research interests recently. However, due to the symmetric and unitary passive beamforming constraint imposed on BD-RIS, existing joint active and passive beamforming optimization algorithms for BD-RIS either exhibit high computational complexity to achieve near optimal solutions or rely on heuristic algorithms with substantial performance loss. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an efficient optimization framework for BD-RIS assisted multi-user multi-antenna communication networks. Specifically, we solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem by introducing a novel beamforming optimization algorithm that alternately optimizes active and passive beamforming matrices using iterative closed-form solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity while ensuring a sub-optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AI Transparency: XRL-Based Resource Management and RAN Slicing for 6G ORAN Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces an advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework designed to elucidate the decision-making processes of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents in ORAN architectures. By offering network-oriented explanations, the proposed scheme addresses the critical challenge of understanding and optimizing the control actions of DRL agents for resource management and allocation. Traditional methods, both model-agnostic and model-specific approaches, fail to address the unique challenges presented by XAI in the dynamic and complex environment of RAN slicing. This paper transcends these limitations by incorporating intent-based action steering, allowing for precise embedding and configuration across various operational timescales. This is particularly evident in its integration with xAPP and rAPP sitting at near-real-time and non-real-time RIC, respectively, enhancing the system's adaptability and performance. Our findings demonstrate the framework's significant impact on improving Key Performance Indicator (KPI)-based rewards, facilitated by the ability to make informed multimodal decisions involving multiple control parameters by a DRL agent. Thus, our work marks a significant step forward in the practical application and effectiveness of XAI in optimizing ORAN resource management strategies.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communication With Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Semantic Communication (SemCom), which aims to achieve efficient and reliable transmission of meaning between agents, has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. To ensure the security of communication systems, encryption techniques are employed to safeguard confidentiality and integrity. However, traditional cryptography-based encryption algorithms encounter obstacles when applied to SemCom. Motivated by this, this paper explores the feasibility of applying homomorphic encryption to SemCom. Initially, we review the encryption algorithms utilized in mobile communication systems and analyze the challenges associated with their application to SemCom. Subsequently, we employ scale-invariant feature transform to demonstrate that semantic features can be preserved in homomorphic encrypted ciphertext. Based on this finding, we propose a task-oriented SemCom scheme secured through homomorphic encryption. We design the privacy preserved deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder and decoder, and the frequency of key updates can be adjusted according to service requirements without compromising transmission performance. Simulation results validate that, when compared to plaintext images, the proposed scheme can achieve almost the same classification accuracy performance when dealing with homomorphic ciphertext images. Furthermore, we provide potential future research directions for homomorphic encrypted SemCom.</description>

      <title>Distributed Parameter Estimation with Gaussian Observation Noises in Time-varying Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed parameter estimation in sensor networks. Each sensor makes successive observations of an unknown $d$-dimensional parameter, which might be subject to Gaussian random noises. The sensors aim to infer the true value of the unknown parameter by cooperating with each other. To this end, we first generalize the so-called dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) algorithm to stochastic systems, with which the problem of estimating a $d$-dimensional vector parameter is transformed to that of $d$ scalar ones: one for each of the unknown parameters. For each of the scalar problem, both combine-then-adapt (CTA) and adapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion-based estimation algorithms are given, where each sensor performs a combination step to fuse the local estimates in its in-neighborhood, alongside an adaptation step to process its streaming observations. Under weak conditions on network topology and excitation of regressors, we show that the proposed estimators guarantee that each sensor infers the true parameter, even if any individual of them cannot by itself. Specifically, it is required that the union of topologies over an interval with fixed length is strongly connected. Moreover, the sensors must collectively satisfy a cooperative persistent excitation (PE) condition, which relaxes the traditional PE condition. Numerical examples are finally provided to illustrate the established results.</description>

      <title>AIaaS for ORAN-based 6G Networks: Multi-time Scale Slice Resource Management with DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses how to handle slice resources for 6G networks at different time scales in an architecture based on an open radio access network (ORAN). The proposed solution includes artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge of the network and applies two control-level loops to obtain optimal performance compared to other techniques. The ORAN facilitates programmable network architectures to support such multi-time scale management using AI approaches. The proposed algorithms analyze the maximum utilization of resources from slice performance to take decisions at the inter-slice level. Inter-slice intelligent agents work at a non-real-time level to reconfigure resources within various slices. Further than meeting the slice requirements, the intra-slice objective must also include the minimization of maximum resource utilization. This enables smart utilization of the resources within each slice without affecting slice performance. Here, each xApp that is an intra-slice agent aims at meeting the optimal quality of service (QoS) of the users, but at the same time, some inter-slice objectives should be included to coordinate intra- and inter-slice agents. This is done without penalizing the main intra-slice objective. All intelligent agents use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to meet their objectives. We have presented results for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC), and massive machine type communication (mMTC) slice categories.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation-based Rotation and Translation Estimation for Rigid Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel solution to the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) rotation and translation is estimated by only utilizing the range measurements between the wireless sensors on the rigid body and the anchor sensors. The proposed framework first constructs a linear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm to estimate the absolute sensor positions utilizing the range-based received signal model, which is used for the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized with a small-angle approximation. In light of the reformulated system, a second bivariate GaBP is designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation distances, with an interference cancellation (IC) refinement to improve the angle estimation performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via numerical simulations, highlighting the superior performance of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques for the position, rotation, and translation estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spectral Differentiation in Grid-Based Continuous State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the state estimation of stochastic models with continuous dynamics. The aim is to incorporate spectral differentiation methods into the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation in grid-based state estimation routine, while taking into account the specifics of the field, such as probability density function (PDF) features, moving grid, zero boundary conditions, etc. The spectral methods, in general, achieve very fast convergence rate of O(c^N )(O &lt; c &lt; 1) for analytical functions such as the probability density function, where N is the number of grid points. This is significantly better than the standard finite difference method (or midpoint rule used in discrete estimation) typically used in grid-based filter design with convergence rate O( 1 / N^2 ). As consequence, the proposed spectral method based filter provides better state estimation accuracy with lower number of grid points, and thus, with lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Jointly optimal array geometries and waveforms in active sensing: New insights into array design via the Cram\'er-Rao bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates jointly optimal array geometry and waveform designs for active sensing. Specifically, we focus on minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRB) of the angle of a single target in white Gaussian noise. We first find that several array-waveform pairs can yield the same CRB by virtue of sequences with equal sums of squares, i.e., solutions to certain Diophantine equations. Furthermore, we show that under physical aperture and sensor number constraints, the CRB-minimizing receive array geometry is unique, whereas the transmit array can be chosen flexibly. We leverage this freedom to design a novel sparse array geometry that not only minimizes the single-target CRB given an optimal waveform, but also has a nonredundant and contiguous sum co-array, a desirable property when launching independent waveforms, with relevance also to the multi-target case.</description>

      <title>Tensor Train Discrete Grid-Based Filters: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the state estimation of stochastic systems and examines the possible employment of tensor decompositions in grid-based filtering routines, in particular, the tensor-train decomposition. The aim is to show that these techniques can lead to a massive reduction in both the computational and storage complexity of grid-based filtering algorithms without considerable tradeoffs in accuracy. This claim is supported by an algorithm descriptions and numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Convex Optimization: A Contraction and Equilibrium Tracking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a novel and broadly-applicable contraction-theoretic approach to continuous-time time-varying convex optimization. For any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics, we show that the tracking error is asymptotically proportional to the rate of change of the parameter and that the proportionality constant is upper bounded by Lipschitz constant in which the parameter appears divided by the contraction rate of the dynamics squared. We additionally establish that augmenting any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics with a feedforward prediction term ensures that the tracking error vanishes exponentially quickly. To apply these results to time-varying convex optimization, we establish the strong infinitesimal contractivity of dynamics solving three canonical problems: monotone inclusions, linear equality-constrained problems, and composite minimization problems. For each case, we derive the sharpest-known contraction rates and provide explicit bounds on the tracking error between solution trajectories and minimizing trajectories. We validate our theoretical results on two numerical examples and on an application to control barrier function-based controller design that involves real hardware.</description>
