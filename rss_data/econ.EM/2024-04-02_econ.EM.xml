      <title>Sequential Synthetic Difference in Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the estimation of treatment effects of a binary policy in environments with a staggered treatment rollout. We propose a new estimator -- Sequential Synthetic Difference in Difference (Sequential SDiD) -- and establish its theoretical properties in a linear model with interactive fixed effects. Our estimator is based on sequentially applying the original SDiD estimator proposed in Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) to appropriately aggregated data. To establish the theoretical properties of our method, we compare it to an infeasible OLS estimator based on the knowledge of the subspaces spanned by the interactive fixed effects. We show that this OLS estimator has a sequential representation and use this result to show that it is asymptotically equivalent to the Sequential SDiD estimator. This result implies the asymptotic normality of our estimator along with corresponding efficiency guarantees. The method developed in this paper presents a natural alternative to the conventional DiD strategies in staggered adoption designs.</description>

      <title>Convolution-t Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of multivariate heavy-tailed distributions that are convolutions of heterogeneous multivariate t-distributions. Unlike commonly used heavy-tailed distributions, the multivariate convolution-t distributions embody cluster structures with flexible nonlinear dependencies and heterogeneous marginal distributions. Importantly, convolution-t distributions have simple density functions that facilitate estimation and likelihood-based inference. The characteristic features of convolution-t distributions are found to be important in an empirical analysis of realized volatility measures and help identify their underlying factor structure.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning for Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many public policies and medical interventions involve dynamics in their treatment assignments, where treatments are sequentially assigned to the same individuals across multiple stages, and the effect of treatment at each stage is usually heterogeneous with respect to the history of prior treatments and associated characteristics. We study statistical learning of optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) that guide the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's history. We propose a step-wise doubly-robust approach to learn the optimal DTR using observational data under the assumption of sequential ignorability. The approach solves the sequential treatment assignment problem through backward induction, where, at each step, we combine estimators of propensity scores and action-value functions (Q-functions) to construct augmented inverse probability weighting estimators of values of policies for each stage. The approach consistently estimates the optimal DTR if either a propensity score or Q-function for each stage is consistently estimated. Furthermore, the resulting DTR can achieve the optimal convergence rate $n^{-1/2}$ of regret under mild conditions on the convergence rate for estimators of the nuisance parameters.</description>

      <title>Estimating sample paths of Gauss-Markov processes from noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I derive the pointwise conditional means and variances of an arbitrary Gauss-Markov process, given noisy observations of points on a sample path. These moments depend on the process's mean and covariance functions, and on the conditional moments of the sampled points. I study the Brownian motion and bridge as special cases.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference for a Class of Generalized Hierarchical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for the unknown parameters and function involved in a class of generalized hierarchical models. Such models are of great interest in the literature of neural networks (such as Bauer and Kohler, 2019). We propose a rectified linear unit (ReLU) based deep neural network (DNN) approach, and contribute to the design of DNN by i) providing more transparency for practical implementation, ii) defining different types of sparsity, iii) showing the differentiability, iv) pointing out the set of effective parameters, and v) offering a new variant of rectified linear activation function (ReLU), etc. Asymptotic properties are established accordingly, and a feasible procedure for the purpose of inference is also proposed. We conduct extensive numerical studies to examine the finite-sample performance of the estimation methods, and we also evaluate the empirical relevance and applicability of the proposed models and estimation methods to real data.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Sensitivity in Quantitative Spatial Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactuals in quantitative spatial models are functions of the current state of the world and the model parameters. Current practice treats the current state of the world as perfectly observed, but there is good reason to believe that it is measured with error. This paper provides tools for quantifying uncertainty about counterfactuals when the current state of the world is measured with error. I recommend an empirical Bayes approach to uncertainty quantification, which is both practical and theoretically justified. I apply the proposed method to the applications in Adao, Costinot, and Donaldson (2017) and Allen and Arkolakis (2022) and find non-trivial uncertainty about counterfactuals.</description>
