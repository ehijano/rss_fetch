      <title>Bounds and Optimal Results for the Total Irregularity Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (molecular) graph in which all vertices have the same degree is known as a regular graph. According to Gutman, Hansen, and M\'elot [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 45 (2005) 222-230], it is of interest to measure the irregularity of nonregular molecular graphs both for descriptive purposes and for QSAR/QSPR studies. The graph invariants that can be used to measure the irregularity of graphs are referred to as irregularity measures. One of the well-studied irregularity measures is the ``total irregularity'' measure, which was introduced about a decade ago. Bounds and optimization problems for this measure have already been extensively studied. A considerable number of existing results (concerning this measure) also hold for molecular graphs; particularly, the ones regarding lower bounds and minimum values of the mentioned measure. The primary objective of the present review article is to collect the existing bounds and optimal results concerning the total irregularity measure. Several open problems related to the existing results on the total irregularity measure are also given.</description>

      <title>Diameter Constraints in $2$-distance Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any finite, simple graph $G = (V,E)$, its $2$-distance graph $G_2$ is a graph having the same vertex set $V$ where two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is $2$ in $G$. Connectivity and diameter properties of these graphs have been well studied. For example, it has been shown that if $diam(G) = k \geq 3$ then $\lceil \frac{1}{2} k \rceil \leq diam(G_2)$, and that this bound is sharp. In this paper, we prove that $diam(G_2) = \infty$ (that is, $G_2$ is disconnected) or otherwise $diam(G_2) \leq k + 2$. In addition, this inequality is sharp for $k \in \{3,4\}$.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Digraph Reconfiguration by Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfiguration problem for homomorphisms of digraphs to a reflexive digraph cycle, which amounts to deciding if a `reconfiguration graph' is connected, is known to by polynomially time solvable via a greedy algorithm based on certain topological requirements. Even in the case that the instance digraph is a cycle of length $m$, the algorithm, being greedy, takes time $\Omega(m^2)$.
  Encoding homomorphisms between two cycles as a relation on strings that represent the orientations of the cycles, we give a characterization of the components of the reconfiguration graph that can be computed in linear time and logarithmic space. In particular, this solves the reconfiguration problem for homomorphisms of cycle to cycles in log-space.</description>

      <title>Finding Large Sets Without Arithmetic Progressions of Length Three: An Empirical View and Survey II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much work on the following question: given n how large can a subset of {1,...,n} be that has no arithmetic progressions of length 3. We call such sets 3-free. Most of the work has been asymptotic. In this paper we sketch applications of large 3-free sets, review the literature of how to construct large 3-free sets, and present empirical studies on how large such sets actually are. The two main questions considered are (1) How large can a 3-free set be when n is small, and (2) How do the methods in the literature compare to each other? In particular, when do the ones that are asymptotically better actually yield larger sets? (This paper overlaps with our previous paper with the title { Finding Large 3-Free Sets I: the Small n Case}.)</description>

      <title>Fundamental polytope for the isometry group of an alcove</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental alcove $\mathcal{A}$ is a tile in a paving of a vector space $V$ by an affine reflection group $W_{\mathrm{aff}}$. Its geometry encodes essential features of $W_{\mathrm{aff}}$, such as its affine Dynkin diagram $\widetilde{D}$ and fundamental group $\Omega$. In this article we investigate its full isometry group $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$. It is well known that the isometry group of a regular polyhedron is generated by hyperplane reflections on its faces. Being a simplex, an alcove $\mathcal{A}$ is the simplest of polyhedra, nevertheless it is seldom a regular one. In our first main result we show that $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Aut}(\widetilde{D})$. Building on this connection, we establish that $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ is an abstract Coxeter group, with generators given by affine isometric involutions of the ambient space. Although these involutions are seldom reflections, our second main result leverages them to construct, by slicing the Komrakov--Premet fundamental polytope $\mathcal{K}$ for the action of $\Omega$, a family of fundamental polytopes for the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ on $\mathcal{A}$, whose vertices are contained in the vertices of $\mathcal{K}$ and whose faces are parametrized by the so-called balanced minuscule roots, which we introduce here. In an appendix, we discuss some related negative results on stratified centralizers and equivariant triangulations.</description>

      <title>Sets preserved by a large subgroup of the special linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a subset of the the affine plane over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We bound the size of the subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that preserves $E$. As a consequence, we show that if $E$ has size $\ll q^\alpha$ and is preserved by $\gg q^\beta$ elements of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ with $\beta\geq 3\alpha/2$, then $E$ is contained in a line. This result is sharp in general, and will be proved by using a point-line incidence bound in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on treewidth via excluding disjoint unions of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental results in graph minor theory is that for every planar graph~$H$, there is a minimum integer~$f(H)$ such that graphs with no minor isomorphic to~$H$ have treewidth at most~$f(H)$. The best known bound for an arbitrary planar $H$ is ${O(|V(H)|^9\operatorname{poly~log} |V(H)|)}$. We show that if $H$ is the disjoint union of cycles, then $f(H)$ is $O(|V(H)|\log^2 |V(H)|)$, which is a $\log|V(H)|$ factor away being optimal.</description>

      <title>The strong spectral property for some families of unicyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To find all the possible spectra of all real symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal pattern is prescribed by the adjacencies of a given graph $G$, the Strong Spectral Property turned out to be of crucial importance. In particular, we investigate the set ${\mathcal G}^{\text{SSP}}$ of all simple graphs $G$ with the property that each symmetric matrix of the pattern of $G$ has the Strong Spectral Property. In this paper, we completely characterize unicyclic graphs of girth three in ${\mathcal G}^{\text{SSP}}$. We prove that any tadpole graph of girth at most five is in ${\mathcal G}^{\text{SSP}}$ and we show that the same is not valid for girth six tadpole graphs.</description>

      <title>Studying the divisibility of power LCM matrics by power GCD matrices on gcd-closed sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S=\{x_1,\ldots, x_n\}$ be a gcd-closed set (i.e. $(x_i,x_j)\in S $ for all $1\le i,j\le n$). In 2002, Hong proposed the divisibility problem of characterizing all gcd-closed sets $S$ with $|S|\ge 4$ such that the GCD matrix $(S)$ divides the LCM matrix $[S]$ in the ring $M_{n}(\mathbb{Z})$. For $x\in S,$ let $G_S(x):=\{z\in S: z&lt;x, z|x \text{ and } (z|y|x, y\in S)\Rightarrow y\in\{z,x\}\}$. In 2009, Feng, Hong and Zhao answered this problem in the context where $\max_{x \in S}\{|G_S(x)|\} \leq 2$. In 2022, Zhao, Chen and Hong obtained a necessary and sufficient condition on the gcd-closed set $S$ with $\max_{x \in S}\{|G_S(x)|\}=3$ such that $(S)|\left[S\right].$ Meanwhile, they raised a conjecture on the necessary and sufficient condition such that $(S)|\left[S\right]$ holds for the remaining case $\max_{x \in S}\{|G_S(x)|\}\ge 4$. In this papar, we confirm the Zhao-Chen-Hong conjecture from a novel perspective, consequently solve Hong's open problem completely.</description>

      <title>A uniform action of the dihedral group $ Z_2\times D_3$ on Littlewood--Richardson coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the dihedral group $ Z_2\times D_3$ of order twelve acts faithfully on the set LR, either consisting of Littlewood-Richardson tableaux, or their companion tableaux, or Knutson-Tao hives or Knutson-Tao-Woodward puzzles,via involutions which simultaneously conjugate or shuffle a Littlewood-Richardson triple of partitions. The action of $ Z_2\times D_3$ carries a linear time index two subgroup $H\simeq D_3$ action, where an involution which goes from $H$ into the other coset of H is difficult in the sense that it is not manifest neither exhibited by simple means. Pak and Vallejo have earlier made this observation with respect to the subgroup of index two in the symmetric group $ S_3$ consisting of cyclic permutations which H extends. The other half LR symmetries, not in the range of the H-action, are hidden and consist of commutativity and conjugation symmetries. Their exhibition is reduced to the action of a remaining generator of $ Z_2\times D_3$, which belongs to the other coset of H, and enables to reduce in linear time all known LR commuters and transposers to each other, and to the Luzstig- Sch\"utzenberger involution. A hive is specified by superimposing the companion tableau pair of an LR tableau, and its $Z_2\times D_3$-symmetries are exhibited via the corresponding LR companion tableau pair. The action of $ Z_2\times D_3$ on puzzles, naturally in bijection with Purbhoo mosaics, is consistent with the migration map on mosaics which translates to jeu de taquin slides or tableau-switching on LR tableaux. Their H-symmetries are reduced to simple procedures on a puzzle via label swapping together with simple reflections of an equilateral triangle, that is, puzzle dualities, and rotations on an equilateral triangle.</description>

      <title>Block components of generalized quaternion group codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Codes in the generalized quaternion group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$ are considered. Restricting to char$\mathbb{F}_q \nmid 4n$ the structure of an arbitrary code $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$ is described via the Wedderburn decomposition. Moreover it is known that in this case every code $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$ has a generating idempotent $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$. Given the generating idempotent of a code $C$ we determine the different components in its decomposition $C \cong \bigoplus_{j=1}^{r+s}C_j \oplus \bigoplus_{i=1}^{k+t}C'_{i}.$ Afterwards we apply this result to describe the blocks of codes induced by cyclic group codes.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on plane curves related to freeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$ with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$ there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. We also give a combinatorial restriction which a potential minimal counter-example to Terao's Conjecture must satisfy. Moreover, we make more precise a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the exponents and the maximal multiplicity of points in any line arrangement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.01635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a complete classification of finite simple cubic vertex-transitive graphs of girth $6$ is obtained. It is proved that every such graph, with the exception of the Desargues graph on $20$ vertices, is either a skeleton of a hexagonal tiling of the torus, the skeleton of the truncation of an arc-transitive triangulation of a closed hyperbolic surface, or the truncation of a $6$-regular graph with respect to an arc-transitive dihedral scheme. Cubic vertex-transitive graphs of girth larger than $6$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Local $h^*$-polynomials for one-row Hermite normal form simplices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local $h^*$-polynomial of a lattice polytope is an important invariant arising in Ehrhart theory. Our focus is on lattice simplices presented in Hermite normal form with a single non-trivial row. We prove that when the off-diagonal entries are fixed, the distribution of coefficients for the local $h^*$-polynomial of these simplices has a limit as the normalized volume goes to infinity. Further, this limiting distribution is determined by the coefficients for a particular choice of normalized volume. We also provide an analysis of two specific families of such simplices to illustrate and motivate our main result.</description>

      <title>Rays of the deformation cones of graphical zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute a triangulation of certain faces of the submodular cone. More precisely, graphical zonotopes are generalized permutahedra, and hence are associated to faces of the submodular cone. We give a triangulation of these faces for graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 4 vertices. This grants us access to the rays of these faces: Minkowski indecomposable deformations of these graphical zonotopes are segments and triangles. Besides, computer experiments lead to examples of graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 5 vertices, whose graphical zonotopes have high dimensional Minkowski indecomposable deformations.</description>

      <title>On cases where Litt's game is fair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fair coin is flipped $n$ times, and two finite sequences of heads and tails (words) $A$ and $B$ of the same length are given. Each time the word $A$ appears in the sequence of coin flips, Alice gets a point, and each time the word $B$ appears, Bob gets a point. Who is more likely to win? This puzzle is a slight extension of Litt's game that recently set Twitter abuzz. We show that Litt's game is fair for any value of $n$ and any two words that have the same auto-correlation structure by building up a bijection that exchanges Bob and Alice scores; the fact that the inter-correlation does not come into play in this case may come up as a surprise.</description>

      <title>Comparing the $p$-independence number of regular graphs to the $q$-independence number of their line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph, and let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be non-negative integers. A \emph{$p$-independent} set in $G$ is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that the subgraph induced by $S$ has maximum degree at most $p$. The \emph{$p$-independence number} of $G$, denoted by $\alpha_p(G)$, is the cardinality of a maximum $p$-independent set in $G$. Letting $L(G)$ denote the line graph of $G$. In this paper, motivated by the result $\alpha_0(G) \leq \alpha_0(L(G))$, for every $r$-regular graph with $r \geq 1$ (see~\cite{CaDaPe2020}), we investigate which values of $p$, $q$, and $r$ have the property that $\alpha_p(G) \leq \alpha_q(L(G))$ for all $r$-regular graphs $G$. Triples $(p, q, r)$ having this property are called \emph{valid $\alpha$-triples}. Among the results we prove are : \begin{itemize}
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q \geq 3$ , and $r\geq 2$.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \leq q &lt; 3$ and $r\geq 2$.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q = 2$, and $r$ even.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q = 2$, and $r$ odd with $r \geq \max \Big \{ 3, \frac{17(p+1)}{16}\Big \}$. \end{itemize} We also show a close relation between undetermined possible valid $\alpha$-triples, the Linear Aboricity Conjecture, and the Path-Cover Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The chain algebra of a pure poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the chain algebra, originally defined in \cite{GN} for finite distributive lattices to that of finite pure posets. We show this algebra corresponds to the Ehrhart ring of a (0,1)-polytope, termed the chain polytope, and characterize the indecomposability of this polytope. Furthermore, we prove the normality of the chain algebra, describe its canonical module, and extend one of main results from \cite{GN} by computing its Krull dimension. For width-2 pure posets, we determine the algebra's regularity and conditions for it to be Gorenstein or nearly Gorenstein.</description>

      <title>Multifold Convolutions, Generating Functions and 1d Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multifold convolutions of a combinatorial sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$: namely, for each $k \in \N$ the $k$-fold convolution is $\mathcal{M}^{(k)}_n(\boldsymbol{a}) = \sum_{j_1+\dots+j_k=n} a_{j_1} \cdots a_{j_k}$. Let $C_n$ be the Catalan numbers, and let $B_n$ be the central binomial coefficients. Then for random Dyck paths or simple random walk bridges, the multifold convolutions give moments of returns to the origin, using the stars-and-bars problem. There are well-known explicit formulas for the multifold convolutions of $C_n$ and $B_n$. But even for combinatorial sequences $B_n^2$ and $B_n^3$, one may determine asymptotics of multifold convolutions for large $n$. We also discuss large deviations: In a second part of the paper we consider an elementary version of the circle method for calculating asymptotics using complex analysis.</description>
