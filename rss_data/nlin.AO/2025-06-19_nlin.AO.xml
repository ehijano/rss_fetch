      <title>Duplication-divergence growing graph models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>

      <title>Inverted Inference and Recursive Bootstrapping: A Primal-Dual Theory of Structured Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unifying framework that links the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) with optimal transport (OT) via primal-dual inference. We propose that cognitive representations are not static encodings but active dual constraints that shape feasible manifolds for learning and inference. Cognition is formalized as the dynamic alignment of high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content, implemented through cycle-consistent inference that minimizes conditional entropy. Central to this framework is the concept of inverted inference: a goal-driven mechanism that reverses the direction of conditioning to simulate latent trajectories consistent with internal goals. This asymmetric inference cycle closes the duality gap in constrained optimization, aligning context (primal variables) with content (dual constraints), and reframing inference as structure-constrained entropy minimization. Temporally, we introduce recursive bootstrapping, where each inference cycle sharpens the structural manifold for the next, forming memory chains that support path-dependent optimization and hierarchical goal decomposition. Spatially, we extend the model via hierarchical spatial bootstrapping, connecting to Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs to enable sublinear retrieval of goal-consistent latent states. Altogether, this framework provides a computational theory of cognition in which dynamic alignment across time and space supports efficient generalization, abstraction, and adaptive planning. CCUP emerges as a scalable principle for both slow, recursive reasoning and fast, structure-aware recognition through layered primal-dual cycles.</description>
