      <title>Local structure characterization in particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many tools and techniques measure local structure in materials in contexts ranging from biology to geology. We provide a survey of those tools and metrics that are especially useful for analyzing particulate soft matter. The metrics we discuss can all be computed from the positions of particles, and are thus most useful when there is access to this information, either from simulation or experimental imaging. For each metric, we provide derivations, intuition regarding its implications, example uses, and references to software packages that compute the metric. Our survey encompasses characterization techniques ranging from the simplest to the most complex, and will be useful for students getting started in the structural characterization of particle systems.</description>

      <title>Snapping and Switching of Elastic Arches with Patterned Preferred Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elastic arch is an archetypal bistable system. Here, we combine elastica theory and photo-mechanical experiments to elucidate the mechanics of an active arch with a spatio-temporally varying preferred curvature $\overline \kappa(s)$. Our shallow-arch theory completely describes any such system via the decomposition of its $\overline \kappa(s)$ into Euler-buckling modes. Intuitively, if $\overline \kappa(s)$ overlaps with the fundamental mode, it snaps the arch up/down. Conversely, non-overlapping $\overline \kappa(s)$ drives a second-order transition to a higher-order shape. Furthermore, the form of $\overline \kappa(s)$ enables control over the instability's character; we find the forms for snapping with maximum energy release and at the lowest stimulation (both binary patterns) and design forms for symmetric and asymmetric switching pathways. Analogous control can also be achieved in boundary-driven instabilities of passive arches by fabricating them with suitable $\overline \kappa(s)$. We thus anticipate our results will improve switchable/snapping elements in MEMS, robotics, and mechanical meta-materials.</description>

      <title>Multiple Emulsions (W/O/W) for Confined Precipitation of Drug Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple emulsions offer a compelling route to confine nucleation and growth during drug precipitation, yet their practical use is frequently limited by kinetic fragility and sensitivity to formulation and processing conditions. Here, we develop an ultrasound-assisted, two-stage emulsification strategy to generate water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) multiple emulsions with sufficient stability to function as templates for forming drug-rich submicron particulates. We first establish an operating window using simple W/O emulsions, showing that increased Tween~80 concentration and intensified sonication (higher amplitude and larger probe) yield smaller droplets and reduced coarsening tendencies. Using this window, W/O/W emulsions are formulated and systematically screened via surfactant pairing across ionic, non-ionic, and polymeric stabilizers. Ionic--non-ionic combinations provide the most favorable droplet-size control, with CTAB--Tween~80 emerging as a practically robust formulation. Cyclohexane was selected as a reproducible platform oil for downstream precipitation using the lead CTAB--Tween~80 formulation. Finally, curcumin-loaded W/O/W constructs generate curcumin-rich submicron particulates, supporting multiple emulsions as experimentally accessible microstructured environments for particle engineering of poorly soluble drugs.</description>

      <title>Wetting-coupled phase separation as an energetic mechanism for active bacterial adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adhesion of motile bacteria from dilute suspensions poses a fundamental non-equilibrium problem: hydrodynamic interactions bias bacterial motion near surfaces without generating stable confinement, while electrostatic interactions are predominantly repulsive. Here, combining experiments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in a polyethylene glycol/dextran aqueous two-phase system with large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we identify wetting-coupled liquid--liquid phase separation (LLPS) as an energetic trapping mechanism for bacterial adhesion. When bacteria partition into a phase that preferentially wets the substrate, interfacial free-energy minimization creates a deep energetic trap that stabilizes adhesion and induces lateral clustering via capillary interactions. Crucially, bacterial motility plays a dual role: at low phase volume fractions, activity enhances transport into the wetting layer and promotes accumulation, whereas at higher phase volumes it suppresses adhesion through the formation of self-spinning droplets that generate hydrodynamic lift opposing interfacial trapping. Our results establish wetting-coupled LLPS as a generic physical route governing interfacial organization in active suspensions. This provides a unified energetic framework for bacterial adhesion in complex fluids, with broad implications for deciphering bacterial-cell interactions and controlling biofilm formation.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Probability Density Alternation Method for Inverse Analyses of Integral Equations in Surface Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral equations frequently arise in surface science, and in some cases, they must be treated as inverse problems. In our previous work on optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, and surface force measurement apparatus, we performed inverse calculations to obtain the pressure between parallel plates from measured interaction forces. These inverse analyses were used to reconstruct solvation structures near solid surfaces and density distribution profiles of colloidal particles. In the course of these studies, we developed a method that enables inverse analyses through a unified and systematic procedure, hereafter referred to as the Probability Density Alternation (PDA) method. The central idea of this method is to reformulate a given integral equation in terms of probability density functions. In this letter, we demonstrate the validity of the PDA method both analytically and numerically. While the PDA method is less advantageous for single integral equations, it becomes a convenient and powerful approach for inverse analyses involving double or higher-order integral equations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Design of a Simple Three-Sphere Magnetic Microswimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Janus Polymeric Giant Vesicles on Demand: A Predictive Phase Separation Approach for Efficient Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Janus particles, with their intrinsic asymmetry, are attracting major interest in various applications, including emulsion stabilization, micro/nanomotors, imaging, and drug delivery. In this context, Janus polymersomes are particularly attractive for synthetic cell development and drug delivery systems. While they can be achieved by inducing a phase separation within their membrane, their fabrication method remains largely empirical. Here, we propose a rational approach, using Flory-Huggins theory, to predict the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design. These polymersomes can be extruded to achieve quasi-monodisperse vesicles while maintaining their Janus-like morphology, paving the way for their asymmetric functionalization and use as active carriers.</description>

      <title>Tuning cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal self-assembly in spherical confinement via salt and sonication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) self-assemble into cholesteric liquid crystals that produce structural color upon solvent removal. Although most studies examine this process in planar films, confinement within micron-sized water-in-oil droplets provides a powerful platform for resolving self-assembly dynamics in real time. Here, we investigate how two common pitch-tuning strategies, sodium chloride addition and tip sonication, govern the kinetics and structure of CNC self-assembly under spherical confinement. Polarized optical microscopy timelapses capture the evolution from isotropic suspension through tactoid nucleation and annealing to kinetic arrest and final buckling. Consistent with prior work, pitch-concentration analysis reveals a universal post-arrest regime governed by droplet shrinkage. Beyond this established behavior, we identify a pre-arrest regime in which pitch decreases rapidly and whose kinetics accelerate with increasing salt concentration and sonication dose. These parameters shift the onset of cholesteric order and gelation, thereby tuning the concentration window for tactoid coalescence. Together, these results establish droplet confinement as a quantitative platform for probing out-of-equilibrium CNC self-assembly and for kinetically programming structurally colored soft materials.</description>

      <title>Rheofluidics: frequency-dependent rheology of single drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Rheofluidics, a microfluidic technique that measures the frequency-dependent rheology of individual micron-scale objects. We apply oscillatory hydrodynamic stresses by flowing them through channels with modulated constrictions, and measure their deformation. Unlike bulk rheology, which measures collective properties, Rheofluidics provides heretofore unattainable measurements of individual particles. We apply Rheofluidics to discover frequency-dependent surface tension of surfactants, very high-frequency viscoelasticity of microgels and unexpected frequency-dependent bending modulus of vesicles.</description>

      <title>Modulators Selectively Reshape alpha-Synuclein Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein phase transitions govern numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In Parkinson's disease, distinct species of the protein alpha-synuclein undergo phase transitions from highly disordered to ordered beta-rich states. The emerging species and transitions between them can be reshaped by chaperones, small molecules, peptides or antibodies. Here, we use coarse-grained simulations to understand the effect of modulators on the thermodynamics and kinetics of alpha-synuclein transformations and phase transitions. Each protein is represented as a single morphing particle that transforms from a soft sphere (disordered state) to a hard spherocylinder (beta-rich state), while modulators are modeled as soft isotropic particles mimicking small peptides. The results show that purely repulsive modulators do not alter the final outcome, i.e. fibrils form following the same mechanisms independently of the modulator concentration. Attractive interactions towards the disordered protein slow down fibril formation in a dose-dependent manner by stabilizing intermediate species, and strong attraction yields persistent disordered heteroclusters. In contrast, specific attraction to the beta-rich state results in shorter fibrils through direct modulator surface "capping" that introduce kinetic barriers to monomer templating at the fibril ends and inhibit lateral attachment. Together, these results link modulator properties and environmental conditions to the effects on nucleation, fibril elongation and off-pathway trapping, providing a quantitative roadmap for selecting modulator properties and strategies that redirect phase transitions toward desirable endpoints. Additionally, they provide guiding principles for the development of intervention strategies and the engineering of novel materials with tunable and responsive properties.</description>

      <title>Aggregating swarms through morphology handling design contingencies: from the sweet spot to a rich expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological computing, the use of the physical design of a robot to ease the realization of a given task has been proven to be a relevant concept in the context of swarm robotics. Here we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically, that the success of such a strategy may heavily rely on the type of policy adopted by the robots, as well as on the details of the physical design. To do so, we consider a swarm of robots, composed of Kilobots embedded in an exoskeleton, the design of which controls the propensity of the robots to align or anti-align with the direction of the external force they experience. We find experimentally that the contrast that was observed between the two morphologies in the success rate of a simple phototactic task, where the robots were programmed to stop when entering a light region, becomes dramatic, if the robots are not allowed to stop, and can only slow down. Building on a faithful physical model of the self-aligning dynamics of the robots, we perform numerical simulations and demonstrate on one hand that a precise tuning of the self-aligning strength around a sweet spot is required to achieve an efficient phototactic behavior, on the other hand that exploring a range of self-alignment strength allows for a rich expressivity of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of single-particle and collective dynamics in arrested phase-separating glassy mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and dynamics of a hard colloid--star polymer mixture in the range of its arrested phase separation, where an incipient demixing transition is interfering with a nearby vitrification line, focusing on the protein limit (smaller hard component). Soft-hard mixtures present a rich dynamics, influenced by different parameters such as the concentration of the soft and hard components, the softness of the potential, and the size ratio between the two components. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize the single-particle and collective dynamics of the hard colloidal tracers in the soft glassy matrix. The hard tracers show diffusive behavior of the mean squared displacement accompanied by non-exponential relaxation of the intermediate scattering functions at intermediate length scales and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Moreover, we show that the system exhibits arrested phase separation, leading to population splitting and decoupling between self- and collective dynamics of the hard colloids. Overall, we demonstrate that the interplay between arrested phase separation and glassiness leads to complex, multiscale phenomena that strongly influence the dynamics of the hard additives in the arrested matrix formed by the soft colloids.</description>

      <title>Controlling microalgae populations by phototactic memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how microorganisms navigate in complex environments is a central question in active matter and biological physics. Phototaxis - the ability to use light as a navigation cue - is a widespread strategy in motile microalgae to optimise photosynthesis and avoid light-induced stress. The microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for studying this behaviour, where navigation is classically attributed to a photosensitive organelle named eyespot. While this mechanism enables cells to sense the direction of incoming light, their response to light intensity gradients remains less understood. Here we show that structured light landscapes can guide microalgae populations and localise them in defined spatial regions. By analysing single-cell trajectories, we find that cells actively steer relative to the local light gradient, and a comparison with a minimal theoretical model shows that a short-time memory of light exposure acting on the transition between positive and negative phototaxis is necessary to reproduce the observed accumulation. At longer times, we observe a gradual decrease in cell number density within the trapping region, consistent with phototactic adaptation. Beyond controlling population dynamics, our results reveal new aspects of phototactic behaviour, highlighting gradient-aligned steering together with temporal integration as central mechanisms for navigation in structured environments.</description>

      <title>A Polarization Hall Effect in Hydrated DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how biological soft matter responds to electromagnetic fields under ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media.</description>

      <title>Energetic vs Inference-Based Invisibility: Fisher-Information Analysis of Two-Layer Acoustic Near-Cloaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06091</link>

Abstract: Near-cloaks based on passive coatings can strongly suppress scattered-field energy in a narrow frequency band, yet an observer's ability to infer object parameters from noisy measurements need not decrease proportionally. We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.</description>

      <title>Derivation and Analysis of Amplitude Equation for Generalized AMB+ in Presence of Chemical Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and analyze the amplitude equation for the roll patterns in case of generalized Active Model B+ (AMB+) in the presence of chemical reactions. The generalized AMB+ differs from the original AMB+ introduced by Tjhung \textit{et al.} [E. Tjhung \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X \textbf{8}, 031080 (2018)] by the addition of a quadratic term, $g\phi^2$, in the expression for the equilibrium part of the current. Also, the model includes a rotation-free active current of strength $\lambda$ and a rotational current of strength $\xi$. The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $\Gamma$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $\Gamma_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $\lambda$, and $\xi$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability. We find that for $g = 0$, the transition is always supercritical, whereas for $g \ne 0$, the transition between the supercritical and subcritical regimes depends sensitively on the model parameters. Further, we derive the condition for the \textit{Eckhaus instability} from the stability analysis of the amplitude equation as well as from the phase diffusion equation, and find that it is independent of $g$.</description>

      <title>Non Markovian Corrections to Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tegmark's widely cited bound on decoherence times in biological systems is derived under the assumption of a delta correlated, memoryless environment. In this work we show that any finite environmental memory universally induces quadratic short time decoherence, in validating the exponential decay law at early times. For an Ornstein Uhlenbeck environment we derive a closed non markovian expression for the coherence dynamics and obtain a de-coherence time that scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. In the singular limit of vanishing bath memory our result reduces exactly to Tegmark's bound. Numerical simulations based on an exact pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling. These findings demonstrate that Tegmark's result applies only in the Markovian limit and does not rule out mesoscopic quantum coherence in structured biological media.</description>

      <title>Rigid spheres moving through soft solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of an experimental investigation into buoyant rigid spheres rising through highly concentrated collections of hydrated hydrogel particles. The volume fraction of particles is such that the mechanical properties of the material are intermediate between a very viscous fluid and a soft solid. Despite the established time dependent, non-Newtonian character of hydrogels, we find that when the surface of the material is free, an immersed buoyant sphere rises with a constant speed. The effects of the motion are observed to be highly localized around the sphere. When the stress exerted on the material is changed by varying the mass of the sphere, its terminal velocity is found to depend exponentially on its buoyancy. Qualitatively distinct behavior is found when a solid lid is placed on the surface of the material. In this case, a seemingly thixotropic, sublinear time-dependent motion is found. It is observed that linear motion of the sphere is accompanied by flow at the surface of the material whereas fluid movement is suppressed when a lid is present. We use these observations to provide a hypothesis which links the exponential stress dependence of the rheology of the material to the effects of the boundary conditions on the kinematics of the intruder.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable optical trapping of thermophoretically active Janus colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Cross-Interaction Softness as a Route to Microphase Separation in Binary Colloidal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how interparticle interactions govern phase behavior is central to controlling self-organization in multicomponent soft-matter systems. In particular, the role of cross-interactions between unlike components remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate how cross-interaction character controls phase behavior in binary mixtures of hard and soft particles using coarse-grained modeling, Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. Four representative systems are examined that differ only in whether interactions between unlike particles are bounded or hard-sphere. We show that penetrable (bounded) cross-interactions are both necessary and sufficient to induce microphase separation, even in the absence of attractive forces. Such systems exhibit dispersed states, macrophase separation, and microphase-separated morphologies characterized by finite-wavelength compositional ordering. In contrast, purely hard-sphere cross interactions suppress microphase separation entirely, despite strong local clustering. Comparison between theory and simulations reveals qualitative agreement in phase topology, while simulations additionally capture hierarchical and multiscale ordering near crossover regimes. These findings establish cross-interaction softness as a fundamental design principle for controlling phase behavior in multicomponent colloidal and soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Water to Pressure and Cold Denaturation of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:1505.07594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms of cold- and pressure-denaturation of proteins are matter of debate and are commonly understood as due to water-mediated interactions. Here we study several cases of proteins, with or without a unique native state, with or without hydrophilic residues, by means of a coarse-grain protein model in explicit solvent. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Active Brownian Particles Crossing a Parabolic Barrier: Finite Rectangular Domain with Absorbing Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation for a two-dimensional active Brownian particle exploring a rectangular domain with absorbing boundary and in the presence of a parabolic barrier along one direction. By taking those of a passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, we provide a matrix representation of the Fokker-Planck operator and express the propagator in terms of the perturbed eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage-time distribution. The non-equilibrium character of the dynamics induces a strong dependence of the latter quantities on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems: swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that these results stem from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.</description>

      <title>The Photochemical Birth of the Hydrated Electron in Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description>
