      <title>Simulation Studies of the Effect of SiPM Dark Noise on the Performance of a Highly Granular Crystal ECAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proposal for the CEPC ECAL is a highly-granular scintillating crystal design that uses SiPMs to measure physics signals from photons. Radiation damage to the silicon will impair the performance of the calorimeter due to dark noise, which will affect the reconstruction capabilities of the calorimeter system. This paper presents a simulation study assessing the effect of radiation damage of SiPM dark noise on the response from calorimeter to electrons due to changing fluence and temperature. It was observed that dark noise significantly degrades the linearity of response, with up to 45% error in reconstructed energy for a 1 GeV shower at a fluence of $1 \times 10^{10}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The stochastic and noise resolution terms was observed to remain stable, increasing only by 0.2% and 1% respectively in the range $1 \times 10^{7}-1 \times 10^{10}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ fluence. Under the assumption of no irradiation, the influence of dark noise with temperature in the normal operating range of the calorimeter system was estimated to be negligible.</description>

      <title>Measuring dark currents in multiple cryogenic SiPMs with sub-pA sensitivity using an automated IV multiplexer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of an automated current-voltage (IV) multiplexer (MUX) that enables accurate measurement of the dark current in cryogenic silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), achieving a sensitivity equivalent to detecting less than one avalanche per second. Dynamic pulse-counting measurements were used as a benchmark for reconstructing the dark current in static IV measurements. The IV-MUX features 15 channels on a single board and up to seven boards can be connected in parallel under the control of one Arduino microcontroller. To minimize leakage and enhance performance, the layout includes guard rings and high-isolation relays, enabling resolution of currents as small as 49 fA. The IV-MUX can be integrated into systems designed for IV or pulse-counting measurements, enabling seamless switching between IV and pulse-counting modes. Moreover, the IV-MUX is vacuum-compatible, validated by testing an SiPM array in a cryostat. This feature reduces the need for multiple feedthroughs when testing sensor arrays in vacuum. The design is open source and can be used to facilitate rapid and automated testing of SiPMs or similar low-current devices in one measurement cycle.</description>

      <title>Overview of the data acquisition system architecture for the DarkSide-20k experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) detector is designed to directly search for dark matter by detecting weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scattering off nuclei in a 20 tonnes target of low radioactivity Argon from underground sources, in a dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The scintillation light produced by these interactions is recorded by custom silicon photomultiplier (SiPMs) assemblies comprising the detector's 2720 readout channels. The data acquisition system (DAQ) for the DS-20k experiment operates in a triggerless mode, handling the estimated 3 GB/s flow of digitized data from MC simulation from the entire detector, dominated by the TPC. Signals are digitized by 48 commercial VX2745 CAEN 16-bit, 125 MS/s, high channel density waveform digitizers. This digitized data is then transferred to 24 Front-End Processor (FEP) machines for an initial data reduction stage. Subsequently, the processed data is sent to a separate set of Time Slice Processor (TSP) computers, where it is assembled into fixed-length time series for further analysis and storage for offline processing.</description>

      <title>The measurement problem in liquid NMR quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the quantum state diffusion measurement theory(QSD), the measurement problem in liquid nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) quantum computers was addressed and then it was shown that due to statistical fluctuations, the measured magnetic moment value is comparable to noise for long times. Therefore, we suggested that the measurement time should be short to distinguish signal from noise.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Amplifier Sensing Charged-Coupled Device: Model and improvement of the Node Removal Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multiple Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) has emerged as a promising technology for astronomical observation, quantum imaging, and low-energy particle detection due to its ability to reduce the readout noise without increasing the readout time as in its predecessor, the Skipper-CCD, by reading out the same charge packet through multiple inline amplifiers. Previous works identified a new parameter in this sensor, called the Node Removal Inefficiency (NRI), related to inefficiencies in charge transfer and residual charge removal from the output gates after readout. These inefficiencies can lead to distortions in the measured signals similar to those produced by the charge transfer inefficiencies in standard CCDs. This work introduces more details in the mathematical description of the NRI mechanism and provides techniques to quantify its magnitude from the measured data. It also proposes a new operation strategy that significantly reduces its effect with minimal alterations of the timing sequences or voltage settings for the other components of the sensor. The proposed technique is corroborated by experimental results on a sixteen-amplifier MAS-CCD. At the same time, the experimental data demonstrate that this approach minimizes the NRI effect to levels comparable to other sources of distortion the charge transfer inefficiency in scientific devices.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Thermal Management Strategies for the Silicon Detectors of CBM at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightweight thermal management is central to the design of the all-silicon Inner Tracker of the Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). This experiment aims to study strongly interacting matter at neutron star core densities through fixed-target Au-Au collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9 - 4.9$\,GeV; up to 10$^7$ beam-target interactions per second; polar angular acceptance of $2.5^{\circ} \leq \Theta \leq 25^{\circ}$). Studies with thermal demonstrators for both the pixel-based Micro Vertex Detector and the strip-based Silicon Tracking System have validated their thermal management strategies, preparing them for series production now and global commissioning in 2028.</description>

      <title>Mechanical design concept version 2.0 for the miniBeBe subsystem of the Multi-Purpose Detector at the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design of the mechanical structure of the mini Beam-Beam detector, a subsystem of the Multi-Purpose Detector, soon to enter into operation at the Nuclotron based Ion Collider fAcility of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The miniBeBe detector was designed and is currently being developed by the Mexican team of the NICA Collaboration to contribute to the level-zero trigger of the Time of Flight Detector. The mechanical structure meets the requirements of minimizing the material budget and be free of ferromagnetic materials, without compromising its robustness. The design also allows for easy module replacement for maintenance and overall removal at the end of the first stage of the experiment, without affecting the rest of the subsystems, to leave room for the installation of the Inner Tracking System. In addition, a Finite Element Method analysis of the mechanical components under load was performed. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the design meets the space constraints within the Multi-Purpose Detector, as well as a deformation of less than 1 mm with overall stress of less than 2 MPa, such that no material used in the design is at risk of mechanical failure during operation. The heat transfer analysis of the cooling system revealed that the temperature of the cooling plate is maintained within a range of $19.00^{\circ}$C to $21.41^{\circ}$C, which is sufficient to ensure that the silicon photomultipliers operate below a temperature of 25.00$^{\circ}$C, thereby optimizing their functionality</description>

      <title>Scintillation and Timing Performance of a 3at% Yttrium-Doped Barium Fluoride Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the scintillation and timing performance of a new developed 200 * 20 mm * 20 mm large size barium fluoride crystal doped with 3at% yttrium (BaF2:Y) to enhance the application for high time resolution. This doping effectively suppresses the slow scintillation component while maintaining most of the fast component, as confirmed by X-ray excited luminescence measurements. The BaF2:Y crystal demonstrated a transmittance of near 90% in the visible spectrum and a light response uniformity parameter of delta = (-2.74 +- 1.15)% when coupled with the tail end. The actual yttrium content varied from 2.1at% near the seed end to 3.7at% at the tail end. The assembled large BaF2:Y detector with silicon photomultipliers exhibited a time resolution of (82.2 +- 2.6) ps using constant fraction discrimination method in a cosmic ray test and (140.1 +- 3.8) ps using a low fixed threshold method in a beam test at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility with an 1.35 GeV electron beam. These results indicate the significant potential of BaF2:Y crystal for various applications, such as detectors for particle physics and nuclear physics.</description>
