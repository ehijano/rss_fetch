      <title>A Candidate High-Velocity Exoplanet System in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of adaptive optics (AO) images from the Keck-I telescope of the microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-262. The original discovery paper by Bennett et al. 2014 reports two distinct possibilities for the lens system; a nearby gas giant lens with an exomoon companion or a very low mass star with a planetary companion in the galactic bulge. The $\sim$10 year baseline between the microlensing event and the Keck follow-up observations allows us to detect the faint candidate lens host (star) at $K = 22.3$ mag and confirm the distant lens system interpretation. The combination of the host star brightness and light curve parameters yields host star and planet masses of $M_{\rm host} = 0.19 \pm 0.03M_{\odot}$ and $m_p = 28.92 \pm 4.75M_{\oplus}$ at a distance of $D_L = 7.49 \pm 0.91\,$kpc. We perform a multi-epoch cross reference to \textit{Gaia} DR3 and measure a transverse velocity for the candidate lens system of $v_L = 541.31 \pm 65.75$ km s$^{-1}$. We conclude this event consists of the highest velocity exoplanet system detected to date, and also the lowest mass microlensing host star with a confirmed mass measurement. The high-velocity nature of the lens system can be definitively confirmed with an additional epoch of high-resolution imaging at any time now. The methods outlined in this work demonstrate that the \textit{Roman} Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will be able to securely measure low-mass host stars in the bulge.</description>

      <title>Formation of Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects through photoerosion of fragmenting cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of tens of Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster with the James Webb Space Telescope has intensified the debate on the origin of free-floating planetary mass objects within star-forming regions. The JuMBOs have masses below the opacity limit for fragmentation, but have very wide separations (10s - 100s au), suggesting that they did not form in a similar manner to other substellar mass binaries. Here, we propose that the theory of photoerosion of prestellar cores by Lyman continuum radiation from massive stars could explain the JuMBOs in the ONC. We find that for a range of gas densities the final substellar mass is comfortably within the JuMBO mass range, and that the separations of the JuMBOs are consistent with those of more massive (G- and A-type) binaries, that would have formed from the fragmentation of the cores had they not been photoeroded. The photoerosion mechanism is most effective within the HII region(s) driven by the massive star(s). The majority of the observed JuMBOs lie outside of these regions in the ONC, but may have formed within them and then subsequently migrated due to dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring tidal dissipation in rubble pile binary secondaries using a discrete element model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, models of rubble pile binary secondaries are simulated in different spin states in a system similar in size and scale to Didymos-Dimorphos. The numerical modeling is performed in the N-body Chrono-based software GRAINS, which simulates gravity, contact, and friction forces acting on non-spherical mass elements. Tidal dissipation successfully emerges in the simulations as an aggregate of the effects of inter-element contact and friction across thousands of simulated mass elements. We devise computational techniques for simulating and studying such systems, establishing rigorous numerical procedures for computing tidal quantities of interest. We compute $Q/k_{2} \sim 43.5^{+36.0}_{-27.2}$ for the secondary, smaller than previously predicted ranges $10^{2} &lt; Q/k_{2} &lt; 10^{6}$, and thus a rather dissipative result. From our simulations, we observe non-classical variation of the tidal lag angle with the topographic longitude, and dependence of $Q/k_{2}$ on the rotation rate. Further study is required to see if the enhanced dissipativity holds with other geometries and regolith properties.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric characterisation of GJ1214b from transit and eclipse observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheric characterisation of GJ1214 b has so far remained uncertain due to the observed flatness of the transit spectra of this planet that is typically attributed to the presence of hazes or clouds in its atmosphere. Here we combine for the first time transit and eclipse observations obtained with JWST to benefit from both type of constraints and advance on the atmospheric characterisation of GJ1214 b. Our results reveal that photochemical hazes can be produced at high enough mass fluxes in the atmosphere of GJ1214 b to explain both type of observations. These hazes have a drastic impact on the atmospheric thermal structure, which has further ramifications on the emitted radiation of the planet, as well as, its Bond albedo. Clouds of KCL, NaCL and ZnS composition also form in this atmosphere but their opacity is too small to explain the observed flatness of the transit spectrum. We find that metallicities in the range 2000-3000x solar provide atmospheric structures that are closest to the observations for haze mass fluxes in the range of (1-3)x1E-11 g cm-2 s-1. Correspondingly the Bond albedo is within 10-20%. Moreover, sulfur photochemistry produces abundant OCS that has a detectable signature in the transit spectra and should be seaked for in future observations. Sulfur should also participate to the haze formation in this atmosphere, therefore optical properties of such compounds are needed.</description>

      <title>Possible Carbon Dioxide Above the Thick Aerosols of GJ 1214 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptune planets with radii smaller than Neptune (3.9 Re) are the most common type of planet known to exist in The Milky Way, even though they are absent in the Solar System. These planets can potentially have a large diversity of compositions as a result of different mixtures of rocky material, icy material and gas accreted from a protoplanetary disk. However, the bulk density of a sub-Neptune, informed by its mass and radius alone, cannot uniquely constrain its composition; atmospheric spectroscopy is necessary. GJ 1214 b, which hosts an atmosphere that is potentially the most favorable for spectroscopic detection of any sub-Neptune, is instead enshrouded in aerosols (thus showing no spectroscopic features), hiding its composition from view at previously observed wavelengths in its terminator. Here, we present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum from 2.8 to 5.1 um that shows signatures of carbon dioxide and methane, expected at high metallicity. A model containing both these molecules is preferred by 3.3 and 3.6 sigma as compared to a featureless spectrum for two different data analysis pipelines, respectively. Given the low signal-to-noise of the features compared to the continuum, however, more observations are needed to confirm the carbon dioxide and methane signatures and better constrain other diagnostic features in the near-infrared. Further modeling of the planet's atmosphere, interior structure and origins will provide valuable insights about how sub-Neptunes like GJ 1214 b form and evolve.</description>

      <title>A Possible Metal-Dominated Atmosphere Below the Thick Aerosols of GJ 1214 b Suggested by its JWST Panchromatic Transmission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GJ1214b is the archetype sub-Neptune for which thick aerosols have prevented us from constraining its atmospheric properties for over a decade. In this study, we leverage the panchromatic transmission spectrum of GJ1214b established by HST and JWST to investigate its atmospheric properties using a suite of atmospheric radiative transfer, photochemistry, and aerosol microphysical models. We find that the combined HST, JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/MIRI spectrum can be well-explained by atmospheric models with an extremely high metallicity of [M/H]$\sim$3.5 and an extremely high haze production rate of $F_{\rm haze}{\sim}10^{-8}$--$10^{-7}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Such high atmospheric metallicity is suggested by the relatively strong CO2 feature compared to the haze absorption feature or the CH4 feature in the NIRSpec-G395H bandpass of 2.5--5 $\mu$m. The flat 5--12 $\mu$m MIRI spectrum also suggests a small scale height with a high atmospheric metallicity that is needed to suppress a prominent 6 $\mu$m haze feature. We tested the sensitivity of our interpretation to various assumptions for uncertain haze properties, such as optical constants and production rate, and all models tested here consistently suggest extremely high metallicity. Thus, we conclude that GJ1214b likely has a metal-dominated atmosphere where hydrogen is no longer the main atmospheric constituent. We also find that different assumptions for the haze production rate lead to distinct inferences for the atmospheric C/O ratio. We stress the importance of high precision follow-up observations to confirm the metal-dominated atmosphere and to constrain the C/O ratio, which provides further insights on the planet formation process. The confirmation of the metal-dominated atmosphere is particularly crucial, as it challenges the conventional understanding of interior structure and evolution of sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Photochemical Hazes in Exoplanetary Skies with Diamonds: Microphysical Modeling of Haze Composition Evolution via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational efforts in the last decade suggest the prevalence of photochemical hazes in exoplanetary atmospheres. Recent JWST observations raise growing evidence that exoplanetary hazes tend to have reflective compositions, unlike the conventionally assumed haze analogs, such as tholin and soot. In this study, I propose a novel hypothesis: diamond formation through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) may be happening in exoplanetary atmospheres. Using an aerosol microphysical model combined with the theory of CVD diamond and soot formation established in the industry community, I study how the haze composition evolves in exoplanetary atmospheres for various planetary equilibrium temperature, atmospheric metallicity, and C/O ratio. I find that CVD diamond growth dominates over soot growth in a wide range of planetary parameters. Diamond haze formation is most efficient at $T_{\rm eq}\sim1000~{\rm K}$ and low atmospheric metallicity ([M/H]$\le2.0$), while soot could be the main haze component only if the atmosphere is hot ($T_{\rm eq}\ge1200~{\rm K}$) and carbon rich (C/O$&gt;1$). I also compute transmission, emission, and reflected light spectra, thereby suggesting possible observational signatures of diamond hazes, including the $3.53~{\rm {\mu}m}$ feature of hydrogenated diamonds, anomalously faint thermal emission due to thermal scattering, and a drastic increase in geometric albedo. This study suggests that warm exoplanetary atmospheres may be favorable sites for forming CVD diamonds, which would be testable by future observations by JWST and Ariel as well as haze synthesis experiments under hot hydrogen-rich conditions.</description>

      <title>Observations of Loki Patera by Juno during close flybys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used data from the Juno spacecraft to investigate both the spatial and temporal properties of Loki Patera on Io, acquired in two infrared bands between December 2022 and April 2024, at spatial resolutions ranging from 400 m to 15 km. Loki shows a thermal structure unlike other active lava lakes previously reported, with some brightening near the perimeter of the lake but lacking the continuous hot ring seen at other paterae. Modeling the slow rate of cooling suggests there is a significant volume of magma beneath the crust to provide the latent heat necessary to decelerate the cooling rate. A thermal propagation that may represent the signature of a resurfacing wave, going from the southwest of the lake to the north, was observed with a velocity of about 2-3 km per day. Data collected in 2024 may indicate the onset of a new resurfacing wave originating from a point source, rather than the foundering of a linear section of the crust. We also observed many small (about 3 km wide), closely spaced (about 10 km apart) islands that have persisted in the same locations for at least 45 years, since first being imaged by Voyager 1. The persistence of these islands challenges resurfacing models of Loki, as they have remained fixed - likely anchored to the lava lake floor - and have not noticeably changed in size, arguing against large-scale thermal erosion. The central island of Loki shows a few thermal structures associated with the fractures that cross the island, indicating that the fractures most likely contain molten lava.</description>

      <title>Widespread occurrence of lava lakes on Io observed from Juno</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report recent observations of lava lakes within patera on Io made by the JIRAM imager/spectrometer on board the Juno spacecraft, taken during close observation occurred in the extended mission. At least 40 lava lakes have been identified from JIRAM observations. The majority (&gt;50%) of paterae have elevated thermal signatures when imaged at sufficiently high spatial resolution (a few km/pixel), implying that lava lakes are ubiquitous on Io. The annular width of the spattering region around the margins, a characteristic of lava lakes, is of the order of few meters to tens of meters, the diameter of the observed lava lakes ranges from 10 to 100 km. The thickness of the crust in the center of some lava lakes is of the order of 5-10 m; we estimate that this crust is a few years old. Also, the bulk of the thermal emission comes from the much larger crust and not from the smaller exposed lava, so the total power output cannot be calculated from the 5-um radiance alone. Eight of the proposed lava lakes have never been reported previously as active hotspots.</description>

      <title>High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the hot-Saturn HD 149026b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in modern technologies enable the characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres, most efficiently exploiting the transmission spectroscopy technique. We performed visible (VIS) and near infrared (nIR) high-resolution spectroscopic observations of one transit of HD 149026b, a close-in orbit sub Saturn exoplanet. We first analysed the radial velocity data, refining the value of the projected spin-orbit obliquity. Then we performed transmission spectroscopy, looking for absorption signals from the planetary atmosphere. We find no evidence for H$\alpha$, NaI D2 - D1, MgI and LiI in the VIS and metastable helium triplet HeI(2$^3$S) in the nIR using a line-by-line approach. The non-detection of HeI is also supported by theoretical simulations. With the use of the cross-correlation technique, we do not detect TiI, VI, CrI, FeI and VO in the visible, and CH$_4$, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, HCN, NH$_3$, VO in the nIR. Our non-detection of TiI in the planetary atmosphere is in contrast with a previous detection. We performed injection-retrieval tests, finding that our dataset is sensitive to our TiI model. The non-detection supports the TiI cold-trap theory, which is valid for planets with $T_{\rm eq} &lt;$ 2200 K like HD 149026b. Even if we do not attribute it directly to the planet, we find a possibly significant TiI signal highly redshifted ($\simeq$+20 km s$^{-1}$) with respect to the planetary restframe. Redshifted signals are also found in the FeI and CrI maps. While we can exclude an eccentric orbit to cause it, we investigated the possibility of material accretion falling onto the star, possibly supported by the presence of strong LiI in the stellar spectrum, without finding conclusive results. The analysis of multiple transits datasets could shed more light on this target.</description>

      <title>Starshade Exoplanet Data Challenge: What We Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starshade is one of the technologies that will enable the observation and characterization of small planets around nearby stars through direct imaging. The Starshade Exoplanetary Data Challenge (SEDC) was designed to validate starshade-imaging's noise budget and evaluate the capabilities of image-processing techniques, by inviting community participating teams to analyze &gt;1000 simulated images of hypothetical exoplanetary systems observed through a starshade. Because the starshade would suppress the starlight so well, the dominant noise source and the main challenge for the planet detection becomes the exozodiacal disks and their structures. In this paper, we summarize the techniques used by the participating teams and compare their findings with the truth. With an independent component analysis to remove the background, about 70% of the inner planets (close to the inner working angle) have been detected and ~40% of the outer planet (fainter than the inner counterparts) have been identified. Planet detection becomes more difficult in the cases of higher disk inclination, as the false negative and false positive counts increase. Interestingly, we found little difference in the planet detection ability between 1e-10 and 1e-9 instrument contrast, confirming that the dominant limitations are from the astrophysical background and not due to the performance of the starshade. Finally, we find that a non-parametric background calibration scheme, such as the independent component analysis reported here, results in a mean residual of 10% the background brightness. This background estimation error leads to substantial false positives and negatives and systematic bias in the planet flux estimation, and should be included in the estimation of the planet detection signal-to-noise ratio for imaging using a starshade and also a coronagraph that delivers exozodi-limited imaging.</description>

      <title>X-Raying Neutral Density Disturbances in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere induced by the 2022 Hunga-Tonga Volcano Eruption-Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-ray observations of the upper atmospheric density disturbance caused by the explosive eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano on 15 January 2022. From 14 January to 16 January, the Chinese X-ray astronomy satellite, Insight-HXMT, was observing the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The X-ray data obtained during Earth's atmospheric occultations allowed us to measure neutral densities in the altitude range of ~90-150 km. The density profiles above 110 km altitude obtained before the major eruption are in reasonable agreement with expectations by both GAIA and NRLMSIS 2.0 models. In contrast, after the HTHH eruption, a severe density depletion was found up to ~1,000 km away from the epicenter, and a relatively weak depletion extending up to ~7,000 km for over 8 hr after the eruption. In addition, density profiles showed wavy structures with a typical length scale of either ~20 km (vertical) or ~1,000 km (horizontal). This may be caused by Lamb waves or gravity waves triggered by the volcanic eruption.</description>

      <title>Launching mass from the Moon helped by lunar gravity anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normally a passive object launched from the Moon at less than the escape velocity orbits the Moon once and then crashes back to the launch site. We show that thanks to lunar gravity anomalies, for specific launch sites and directions, a passive projectile can remain in lunar orbit for up to 9 Earth days. We find that such sites exist at least on the lunar equator for prograde equatorial orbit launches. Three of the sites are located on the lunar nearside. We envision that this can be used to lift material from the Moon at low cost because it gives prolonged opportunities for an active spacecraft to catch the projectile. Passive projectiles can be made entirely from lunar material so that a stream of Earth-imported parts is not needed. To reduce the mass and cost of the launcher, the projectile mass can be scaled down with a corresponding increase in the launch frequency. The projectile launcher itself can be a coilgun, railgun, superconducting quenchgun, sling or any other device that can give a projectile an orbital speed of about 1.7 km/s.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Brown Dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used the multiobject mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to obtain low-resolution 1-5um spectra of 22 brown dwarf candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which were selected with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the targets was previously classified as a Herbig-Haro (HH) object and exhibits strong emission in H I, H2, and the fundamental band of CO, further demonstrating that HH objects can have bright emission in that CO band. The remaining targets have late spectral types (M6.5 to early L) and are young based on gravity sensitive features, as expected for low-mass members of the cluster. According to theoretical evolutionary models, these objects should have masses that range from the hydrogen burning limit to 0.003-0.007 Msun. Two of the NIRSpec targets were identified as proplyds in earlier analysis of Hubble images. They have spectral types of M6.5 and M7.5, making them two of the coolest and least massive known proplyds. Another brown dwarf shows absorption bands at 3-5um from ices containing H2O, CO2, OCN-, and CO, indicating that it is either an edge-on class II system or a class I protostar. It is the coolest and least massive object that has detections of these ice features. In addition, it appears to be the first candidate for a protostellar brown dwarf that has spectroscopy confirming its late spectral type.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities under Geomagnetically Active and Quiet Conditions using NavIC observables: A Spectral Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionospheric irregularities and associated scintillations under geomagnetically active/quiet conditions have detrimental effects on the reliability and performance of space- and ground-based navigation satellite systems, especially over the low-latitude region. The current work investigates the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities using the phase screen theory and the corresponding temporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis to present an estimate of the outer irregularity scale sizes over these locations. The study uses simultaneous L5 signal C/N$_o$ observations of NavIC (a set of GEO and GSO navigation satellite systems) near the northern crest of EIA (Indore: 22.52$^\circ$N, 75.92$^\circ$E, dip: 32.23$^\circ$N) and in between the crest and the dip equator (Hyderabad: 17.42$^\circ$N, 78.55$^\circ$E, dip: 21.69$^\circ$N). The study period (2017-2018) covers disturbed and quiet-time conditions in the declining phase of the solar cycle 24. The PSD analysis brings forward the presence of irregularities, of the order of a few hundred meters during weak-to-moderate and quiet-time conditions and up to a few km during the strong event, over both locations. The ROTI values validate the presence of such structures in the Indian region. Furthermore, only for the strong event, a time delay of scintillation occurrence over Indore, with values of 36 minutes and 50 minutes for NavIC satellites (PRNs) 5 and 6, respectively, from scintillation occurrence at Hyderabad is observed, suggesting a poleward evolution of irregularity structures. Further observations show a westward propagation of these structures on this day. This study brings forward the advantage of utilizing continuous data from the GEO and GSO satellite systems in understanding the evolution and propagation of the ionospheric irregularities over the low-latitude region.</description>

      <title>Candidates for Substellar Members of the Orion Nebula Cluster from JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) obtained 1-5um images of the center of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). I have analyzed these data in an attempt to search for substellar members of the cluster. Using a pair of color-color diagrams, I have identified &gt;200 brown dwarf candidates that lack spectral classifications. Some of the candidates could be protostars (either stellar or substellar) given their very red colors. Based on the age of the ONC and the photometry predicted by theoretical evolutionary models, the faintest candidates could have masses of 1-2 Mjup. This sample of candidates may prove to be valuable for studying various aspects of young brown dwarfs, including their mass function and minimum mass. However, spectroscopy is needed to confirm the membership (via signatures of youth) and late spectral types of the candidates. Finally, I note that most of the "Jupiter-mass binary objects" that have been previously identified with these JWST images are absent from my sample of candidates because their colors are indicative of reddened background sources rather than young brown dwarfs or their photometry is inadequate for assessing their nature because of very low signal-to-noise ratios and/or detections in only a few bands.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb: A Sub-Neptune Beyond the Snow Line of an M-dwarf Confirmed by Keck AO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of high resolution follow-up observations of OGLE-2016-BLG-1195 using Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics with Keck, seven years after the event's peak. We resolve the lens, measuring its flux and the relative source-lens proper motion, thus finding the system to be a $M_{\rm p} = 10.08\pm 1.18\ M_{\rm \oplus}$ planet orbiting an M-dwarf, $M_{\rm L} = 0.62\pm 0.05\ M_{\odot}$, beyond the snow line, with a projected separation of $r_\perp=2.24\pm 0.21$ AU at $D_{\rm L} = 7.45\pm 0.55$ kpc. Our results are consistent with the discovery paper, which reports values with 1-sigma uncertainties based on a single mass-distance constraint from finite source effects. However, both the discovery paper and our follow-up results disagree with the analysis of a different group that also present the planetary signal detection. The latter utilizes \textit{Spitzer} photometry to measure a parallax signal claiming the system is an Earth-mass planet orbiting an ultracool dwarf. Their parallax signal though is improbable since it suggests a lens star in the disk moving perpendicular to Galactic rotation. Moreover, microlensing parallaxes can be impacted by systematic errors in the photometry. Therefore, we reanalyze the \textit{Spitzer} photometry using a Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) model to detrend detector systematics. We find that we can not confidently recover the same detrended light curve that is likely dominated by systematic errors in the photometric data. The results of this paper act as a cautionary tale that a careful understanding of detector systematics and how they influence astrophysical constraints is crucial.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems III: Aperture Masking Interferometric Observations of the star HIP 65426</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present aperture masking interferometry (AMI) observations of the star HIP 65426 at $3.8\,\rm{\mu m}$ as a part of the JWST Direct Imaging Early Release Science (ERS) program obtained using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument. This mode provides access to very small inner working angles (even separations slightly below the Michelson limit of $0.5\lambda/D$ for an interferometer), which are inaccessible with the classical inner working angles of the JWST coronagraphs. When combined with JWST's unprecedented infrared sensitivity, this mode has the potential to probe a new portion of parameter space across a wide array of astronomical observations. Using this mode, we are able to achieve a $5\sigma$ contrast of $\Delta m{\sim}7.62{\pm}0.13$ mag relative to the host star at separations ${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$, and the contrast deteriorates steeply at separations ${\lesssim}0.07{"}$. However, we detect no additional companions interior to the known companion HIP 65426 b (at separation ${\sim}0.82{"}$ or, $87^{+108}_{-31}\,\rm{au}$). Our observations thus rule out companions more massive than $10{-}12\,\rm{M_{Jup}}$ at separations ${\sim}10{-}20\,\rm{au}$ from HIP 65426, a region out of reach of ground or space-based coronagraphic imaging. These observations confirm that the AMI mode on JWST is sensitive to planetary mass companions at close-in separations (${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$), even for thousands of more distant stars at $\sim$100 pc, in addition to the stars in the nearby young moving groups as stated in previous works. This result will allow the planning and successful execution of future observations to probe the inner regions of nearby stellar systems, opening an essentially unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>

      <title>New Candidates for Organic-rich Regions on Ceres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the spatial distribution of organics on Ceres using the visible and near-infrared data collected by the Dawn mission. We employ a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) approach to map organic materials within the Ernutet crater at the highest available spatial resolution revealing a discontinuous, granular distribution and a possible correlation with an ancient crater on which Ernutet has been superimposed. The SMA technique also helps us identify 11 new areas as potential sites for organics. These regions are predominantly located within craters or along their walls, resembling the distribution pattern observed in Ernutet, which implies a possible geological link with materials exposed from beneath the surface. In one of these candidate regions situated in the Yalode quadrangle, we detected the characteristic 3.4-micron absorption band in the infrared spectrum, indicative of organics and carbonates. By combining the spatial resolution of the Framing Camera data with the spectral resolution of the Visual and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer using SMA, we investigated the distribution of the 3.4-micron band in this quadrangle. The absorption pattern correlates with the Yalode/Urvara smooth material unit, which formed after significant impacts on Ceres. The association of organic-rich materials with complex and multiple large-impact events supports for an endogenous origin for the organics on Ceres.</description>

      <title>A general machine learning model of aluminosilicate melt viscosity and its application to the surface properties of dry lava planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period exoplanets like K2-141 b likely have magma oceans on their dayside, which play a critical role in redistributing heat within the planet. This could lead to a warm nightside surface, measurable by the James Webb Space Telescope, offering insights into the planet's structure. Accurate models of properties like viscosity, which can vary by orders of magnitude, are essential for such studies.
  We present a new model for predicting molten magma viscosity, applicable in diverse scenarios, including magma oceans on lava planets. Using a database of 28,898 viscosity measurements on phospho-alumino-silicate melts, spanning superliquidus to undercooled temperatures and pressures up to 30 GPa, we trained a greybox artificial neural network, refined by a Gaussian process. This model achieves high predictive accuracy (RMSE $\approx 0.4 \log_{10}$ Pa$\cdot$s) and can handle compositions from SiO$_2$ to multicomponent magmatic and industrial glasses, accounting for pressure effects up to 30 GPa for compositions such as peridotite.
  Applying this model, we calculated the viscosity of K2-141 b's magma ocean under different compositions. Phase diagram calculations suggest that the dayside is fully molten, with extreme temperatures primarily controlling viscosity. A tenuous atmosphere (0.1 bar) might exist around a 40{\deg} radius from the substellar point. At higher longitudes, atmospheric pressure drops, and by 90{\deg}, magma viscosity rapidly increases as solidification occurs. The nightside surface is likely solid, but previously estimated surface temperatures above 400 K imply a partly molten mantle, feeding geothermal flux through vertical convection.</description>

      <title>Strong Nongravitational Accelerations and the Potential for Misidentification of Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nongravitational accelerations in the absence of observed activity have recently been identified on NEOs, opening the question of the prevalence of anisotropic mass-loss in the near-Earth environment. Motivated by the necessity of nongravitational accelerations to identify 2010 VL$_{65}$ and 2021 UA$_{12}$ as a single object, we investigate the problem of linking separate apparitions in the presence of nongravitational perturbations. We find that nongravitational accelerations on the order of $10^{-9}$ au/d$^2$ can lead to a change in plane-of-sky positions of $\sim10^3$ arcsec between apparitions. Moreover, we inject synthetic tracklets of hypothetical nongravitationally-accelerating NEOs into the Minor Planet Center orbit identification algorithms. We find that at large nongravitational accelerations ($|A_i|\geq10^{-8}$ au/d$^2$) these algorithms fail to link a significant fraction of these tracklets. We further show that if orbits can be determined for both apparitions, the tracklets will be linked regardless of nongravitational accelerations, although they may be linked to multiple objects. In order to aid in the identification and linkage of nongravitationally accelerating objects, we propose and test a new methodology to search for unlinked pairs. When applied to the current census of NEOs, we recover the previously identified case but identify no new linkages. We conclude that current linking algorithms are generally robust to nongravitational accelerations, but objects with large nongravitational accelerations may potentially be missed. While current algorithms are well-positioned for the anticipated increase in the census population from future survey missions, it may be possible to find objects with large nongravitational accelerations hidden in isolated tracklet pairs.</description>
