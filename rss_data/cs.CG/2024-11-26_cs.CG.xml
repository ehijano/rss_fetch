      <title>A review of geometric modeling methods in microstructure design and manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructures, characterized by intricate structures at the microscopic scale, hold the promise of important disruptions in the field of mechanical engineering due to the superior mechanical properties they offer. One fundamental technique of microstructure design and manufacturing is geometric modeling, which generates the 3D computer models required to run high-level procedures such as simulation, optimization, and process planning. There is, however, a lack of comprehensive discussions on this body of knowledge. The goal of this paper is to compile existing microstructure modeling methods and clarify the challenges, progress, and limitations of current research. It also concludes with future research directions that may improve and/or complement current methods, such as compressive and generative microstructure representations. By doing so, the paper sheds light on what has already been made possible for microstructure modeling, what developments can be expected in the near future, and which topics remain problematic.</description>

      <title>Instantiation of Jerboa Rule Schemes, a Set-based Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents a set-theoretic framework for the instantiation of rule schemes in the Jerboa platform, a tool for developing domain-specific geometric modelers. Jerboa enables the design of geometric modeling operations as graph transformation rules generalized to rule schemes for genericity over the topological content of the operations. Current approaches to algebraic graph transformations are typically described within a finitary $\mathcal{M}$-adhesive category (where $\mathcal{M}$ is a suitable system of monomorphisms), employing compositional double-pushout (DPO) semantics for rewriting. In this report, we propose a lightweight, set-theoretic description that exploits the proximity between presheaf topoi and sets to provide an explanation that does not rely on extensive theoretical background. The proposed method simplifies the formal description of modeling operations to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and their practical application in geometric modeling. The framework offers a complementary perspective to categorical approaches at the foundation of Jerboa.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Disk Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $n$ unit-speed mobile agents initially positioned at the center of a unit disk, tasked with inspecting all points on the disk's perimeter. A perimeter point is considered covered if an agent positioned outside the disk's interior has unobstructed visibility of it, treating the disk itself as an obstacle. For $n=1$, this problem is referred to as the shoreline problem with a known distance. Isbell in 1957 derived an optimal trajectory that minimizes the worst-case inspection time for that problem. The one-agent version of the problem was originally proposed as a more tractable variant of Bellman's famous lost-in-the-forest problem.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, and as a warm-up, we extend Isbell's findings by deriving worst-case optimal trajectories addressing the partial inspection of a section of the disk, hence deriving an alternative proof of optimality for inspecting the disk with $n \geq 2$ agents. Second, we analyze the average-case inspection time, assuming a uniform distribution of perimeter points (equivalent to randomized inspection algorithms). Using spatial discretization and Nonlinear Programming (NLP), we propose feasible solutions to the continuous problem and evaluate their effectiveness compared to NLP solutions. Third, we establish Pareto-optimal bounds for the multi-objective problem of jointly minimizing the worst-case and average-case inspection times.</description>

      <title>Pathways to Tractability for Geometric Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical problem of computing geometric thickness, i.e., finding a straight-line drawing of an input graph and a partition of its edges into as few parts as possible so that each part is crossing-free. Since the problem is NP-hard, we investigate its tractability through the lens of parameterized complexity. As our first set of contributions, we provide two fixed-parameter algorithms which utilize well-studied parameters of the input graph, notably the vertex cover and feedback edge numbers. Since parameterizing by the thickness itself does not yield tractability and the use of other structural parameters remains open due to general challenges identified in previous works, as our second set of contributions, we propose a different pathway to tractability for the problem: extension of partial solutions. In particular, we establish a full characterization of the problem's parameterized complexity in the extension setting depending on whether we parameterize by the number of missing vertices, edges, or both.</description>

      <title>Minimum Monotone Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing a Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a set of points is a seminal problem in computational geometry and geometric graph theory. We combine it with another classical problem in graph drawing, namely computing a monotone geometric representation of a given graph. More formally, given a finite set $S$ of points in the plane and a finite set $\cal D$ of directions, a geometric spanning tree $T$ with vertex set $S$ is ${\cal D}$-monotone if, for every pair $\{u,v\}$ of vertices of $T$, there exists a direction $d \in \cal D$ for which the unique path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$ is monotone with respect to $d$. We provide a characterization of ${\cal D}$-monotone spanning trees. Based on it, we show that a ${\cal D}$-monotone spanning tree of minimum length can be computed in polynomial time if the number $k=|{\cal D}|$ of directions is fixed, both when (i) the set ${\cal D}$ of directions is prescribed and when (ii) the objective is to find a minimum-length ${\cal D}$-monotone spanning tree over all sets ${\cal D}$ of $k$ directions. For $k = 2$, we describe algorithms that are much faster than those for the general case. Furthermore, in contrast to the classical Euclidean minimum spanning tree, whose vertex degree is at most six, we show that for every even integer $k$, there exists a point set $S_k$ and a set $\cal D$ of $k$ directions such that any minimum-length $\cal D$-monotone spanning tree of $S_k$ has maximum vertex degree $2k$.</description>
