      <title>Rendering string diagrams recursively</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String diagrams are a graphical language used to represent processes that can be composed sequentially or in parallel, which correspond graphically to horizontal or vertical juxtaposition. In this paper we demonstrate how to compute the layout of a string diagram by folding over its algebraic representation in terms of sequential and parallel composition operators. The algebraic representation can be seen as a term of a free monoidal category or a proof tree for a small fragment of linear logic. This contrasts to existing non-compositional approaches that use graph layout techniques. The key innovation is storing the diagrams in binary space-partition trees, maintaining a right-trapezoidal shape for the diagram's outline as an invariant.
  We provide an implementation in Haskell, using an existing denotational graphics library called Diagrams. Our renderer also supports adding semantics to diagrams to serve as a compiler, with matrix algebra used as an example.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Categorical Cybernetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that several major algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) fit into the framework of categorical cybernetics, that is to say, parametrised bidirectional processes. We build on our previous work in which we show that value iteration can be represented by precomposition with a certain optic. The outline of the main construction in this paper is: (1) We extend the Bellman operators to parametrised optics that apply to action-value functions and depend on a sample. (2) We apply a representable contravariant functor, obtaining a parametrised function that applies the Bellman iteration. (3) This parametrised function becomes the backward pass of another parametrised optic that represents the model, which interacts with an environment via an agent. Thus, parametrised optics appear in two different ways in our construction, with one becoming part of the other. As we show, many of the major classes of algorithms in RL can be seen as different extremal cases of this general setup: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, and deep RL. We see this as strong evidence that this approach is a natural one and believe that it will be a fruitful way to think about RL in the future.</description>

      <title>Multifunctorial Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question in equivariant algebraic K-theory asks whether there exists an equivariant K-theory machine from genuine symmetric monoidal G-categories to orthogonal G-spectra that preserves equivariant algebraic structures. We answer this question positively by constructing an enriched multifunctor K from the G-categorically enriched multicategory of O-pseudoalgebras to the symmetric monoidal category of orthogonal G-spectra, for a compact Lie group G and a 1-connected pseudo-commutative G-categorical operad O. As the main application of its enriched multifunctoriality, K preserves all equivariant algebraic structures parametrized by multicategories enriched in either G-spaces or G-categories. For example, for a finite group G and the G-Barratt-Eccles operad, K transports equivariant E-infinity algebras, in the sense of Guillou-May or Blumberg-Hill, of genuine symmetric monoidal G-categories to equivariant E-infinity algebras of orthogonal G-spectra.</description>

      <title>Lax monoidal adjunctions, two-variable fibrations and the calculus of mates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08808v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a calculus of mates for functors to the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories and extend Lurie's unstraightening equivalences to show that (op)lax natural transformations correspond to maps of (co)cartesian fibrations that do not necessarily preserve (co)cartesian edges. As a sample application we obtain an equivalence between lax symmetric monoidal structures on right adjoint functors and oplax symmetric monoidal structures on the left adjoint functors between symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories that is compatible with both horizontal and vertical composition of such structures.
  As the technical heart of the paper we study various new types of fibrations over a product of two $\infty$-categories. In particular, we show how they can be dualised over one of the two factors and how they encode functors out of the Gray tensor product of $(\infty, 2)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Formal category theory in augmented virtual double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we develop formal category theory within augmented virtual double categories. Notably we formalise the classical notions of Kan extension, Yoneda embedding $\text y_A\colon A \to \hat A$, exact square, total category and 'small' cocompletion; the latter in an appropriate sense. Throughout we compare our formalisations to their corresponding $2$-categorical counterparts. Our approach has several advantages. For instance, the structure of augmented virtual double categories naturally allows us to isolate conditions that ensure small cocompleteness of formal presheaf objects $\hat A$.
  Given a monoidal augmented virtual double category $\mathcal K$ with a Yoneda embedding $\text y_I \colon I \to \hat I$ for its monoidal unit $I$ we prove that, for any 'unital' object $A$ in $\mathcal K$ that has a 'horizontal dual' $A^\circ$, the Yoneda embedding $\text y_A \colon A \to \hat A$ exists if and only if the 'inner hom' $[A^\circ, \hat I]$ exists. This result is a special case of a more general result that, given a functor $F\colon \mathcal K \to \mathcal L$ of augmented virtual double categories, allows a Yoneda embedding in $\mathcal L$ to be "lifted", along a pair of 'universal morphisms' in $\mathcal L$, to a Yoneda embedding in $\mathcal K$.</description>
