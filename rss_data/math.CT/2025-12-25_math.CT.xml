      <title>An alternative description of symmetric monoidal categories, and symmetric 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equivalent description of a symmetric monoidal category is introduced in which, instead of separate associator and commutator isomorphisms satisfying the usual coherence axioms, we simply have associo-commutator isomorphisms satisfying their own coherence laws. In particular, this yields an alternative description of a symmetric 2-group and leads to a cohomological classification of these objects in terms of Eilenberg-MacLane cubical cohomology for abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Canonical differential calculi via functorial geometrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a category $\mathcal{E}$, we establish sufficient conditions on a faithful isofibration $\mathcal{E}\rightarrow\operatorname{Mon}(\mathcal{V})$ valued in the category of monoids internal to a monoidal additive category $\mathcal{V}$ such that $\mathcal{E}$ admits a canonical functor to the category of first order differential calculi in $\mathcal{V}$. Generalizing the procedure of extending a first order differential calculus to its maximal prolongation to this setting, we obtain a canonical functor from $\mathcal{E}$ to the category of differential calculi in $\mathcal{V}$. This yields a simultaneous generalization of the de Rham complex on $C^{\infty}$-rings, the K\"{a}hler differentials on commutative algebras, and the universal differential calculus on associative algebras. As a consequence, such categories $\mathcal{E}$ admit natural analogues of the notions of smooth map and diffeomorphism, as well as a functorial de Rham theory. Moreover, whenever two such faithful isofibrations to $\operatorname{Mon}(\mathcal{V})$ factor suitably, their corresponding de Rham functors are related via a comparison map. Developing this theory requires first extending the noncommutative geometry formalism of differential calculi from associative algebras to the setting of monoids internal to monoidal additive categories.</description>

      <title>Differential bundles as functors from free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores differential bundles in tangent categories, characterizing them as functors from a structure category. This is analogous to the actegory perspective of Garner and Leung, which we also use to describe the tangent categories of Rosick\'y, Cockett and Cruttwell. We generalize the Garner-Leung equivalence between tangent categories and Weil algebra actegories to include lax functors and non-linear natural transformations.
  The main result of this paper, is that differential functors between the structure category $\mathbb N^\bullet$ and a tangent category $\mathbb X$ are equivalent to differential bundles in $\mathbb X$.
  We obtain this result by showing that evaluating a differential functor on the generating object $\mathbb N^1$ of the structure category $\mathbb N^\bullet$ produces a differential bundle in a functorial way. Every differential bundle can be obtained this way. We show that obtaining such a functor from a bundle is a functorial construction.
  There are variations of these results for linear and additive morphisms of differential bundles.</description>

      <title>Gorensteinness from duality pairs induced via Foxby equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study induced duality pairs under Foxby equivalences. Given a semidualizing $(S,R)$-bimodule ${}_S C_R$, if $(\mathcal{A}_C(R),\mathcal{B}_C(R^{\rm op}))$ and $(\mathcal{A}_C(S^{\rm op}),\mathcal{B}_C(S))$ denote the duality pairs formed by the corresponding classes of Auslander and Bass modules, and if $(\mathcal{M,N})$ is a duality pair over $R$, we study the duality pair formed by the essential images of the restricted Foxby equivalences $(C \otimes_R \sim)|_{\mathcal{A}_C(R) \cap \mathcal{M}}$ and $\mathrm{Hom}_{R^{\rm op}}(C,\sim) |_{\mathcal{B}_C(R^{\rm op}) \cap \mathcal{N}}$, denoted by $\mathcal{M}^C(S)$ and $\mathcal{N}^C(S^{\rm op})$. We investigate which additional properties of the duality pair $(\mathcal{M,N})$ are transferred to $(\mathcal{M}^C(S),\mathcal{N}^C(S^{\rm op}))$. We also study several versions of Gorenstein injective and Gorenstein flat modules relative to the pairs $(\mathcal{A}_C(R) \cap \mathcal{M},\mathcal{B}_C(R^{\rm op}) \cap \mathcal{N})$ and $(\mathcal{M}^C(S),\mathcal{N}^C(S^{\rm op}))$. For instance, we explore the relation between these classes of modules under Foxby equivalences and under Pontryagin duality.</description>

      <title>Continuous Hochschild Cohomology and Formality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the appropriate homological setting to study deformation theory of complete locally convex (curved) dg-algebras based on Positselski's contraderived categories. We define the corresponding Hochschild complex controlling deformations and prove formality theorems for the Fr\'echet algebras of smooth functions on a manifold, the de Rham algebra and for the Dolbeault algebra of a complex manifold. In the latter case, the Hochschild cohomology is equivalent to Kontsevich's extended deformation complex, the Hochschild cohomology of the derived category in case $X$ is a smooth projective variety and to Gualtieri's deformation complex of $X$ viewed as generalized complex manifold. We also compute the continuous Hochschild cohomology for various categories of matrix factorisations.</description>

      <title>The free bifibration on a functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing the free bifibration generated by a functor of categories $p : D \to C$. This problem was previously considered by Lamarche, and is closely related to the problem, considered by Dawson, Par\'e, and Pronk, of "freely adjoining adjoints" to a category. We develop a proof-theoretic approach to the problem, beginning with a construction of the free bifibration $\Lambda_p : Bif(p)\to C$ in which objects of $Bif(p)$ are formulas of a primitive "bifibrational logic", and arrows are derivations in a cut-free sequent calculus modulo a notion of permutation equivalence. We show that instantiating the construction to the identity functor generates a _zigzag double category_ $\mathbb{Z}(C)$, which is also the free double category with companions and conjoints (or fibrant double category) on $C$. The approach adapts smoothly to the more general task of building $(P,N)$-fibrations, where one only asks for pushforwards along arrows in $P$ and pullbacks along arrows in $N$ for some subsets of arrows, which encompasses Kock and Joyal's notion of _ambifibration_ when $(P,N)$ form a factorization system. We establish a series of progressively stronger normal forms, guided by ideas of _focusing_ from proof theory, and obtain a canonicity result under assumption that the base category is factorization preordered relative to $P$ and $N$. This canonicity result allows us to decide the word problem and to enumerate relative homsets without duplicates. Finally, we describe several examples of a combinatorial nature, including a category of plane trees generated as a free bifibration over $\omega$, and a category of increasing forests generated as a free ambifibration over $\Delta$, which contains the lattices of noncrossing partitions as quotients of its fibers by the Beck-Chevalley condition.</description>
