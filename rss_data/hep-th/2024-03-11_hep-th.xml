      <title>Exact moduli spaces for $\mathcal{N}=2, D=5$ freely acting orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use freely acting asymmetric orbifolds of type IIB string theory to construct a class of theories in five dimensions with eight supercharges whose moduli spaces for vector multiplets and hypermultiplets can be determined exactly. We argue that no quantum corrections to these moduli spaces arise. We focus on examples in which all moduli are in the NS-NS sector, while all fields from the R-R sector become massive. The full symmetry group of the moduli space is then determined by the subgroup of the T-duality group that survives the orbifold action. We illustrate this for freely acting orbifolds of type IIB string theory on $T^5$ with $0,1$ or $2$ hypermultiplets.</description>

      <title>Propagation speeds of relativistic conformal fluids from a generalized relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the propagation speeds for a conformal real relativistic fluid. We begin from a kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation, where the relaxation time is an arbitrary function of the particle energy in the Landau frame. We propose a parameterization of the one particle distribution function designed to contain a second order Chapman-Enskog solution as a particular case. We derive the hydrodynamic equations applying the moments method to this parameterized one particle distribution function, and solve for the propagation speeds of linearized scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. For relaxation times of the form $\tau=\tau_0(-\beta_{\mu}p^{\mu})^{-a}$, with $-\infty&lt; a&lt;2$, where $\beta_{\mu}=u_{\mu}/T$ is the temperature vector in the Landau frame, we show that the Anderson-Witting prescription $a=1$ yields the fastest speeds.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum chaos via pseudo-entropy and negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum informatic quantities such as entanglement entropy are useful in detecting quantum phase transitions. Recently, a new entanglement measure called pseudo-entropy was proposed which is a generalization of the more well-known entanglement entropy. It has many nice properties and is useful in the study of post-selection measurements. In this paper, one of our goals is to explore the properties of pseudo-entropy and study the effectiveness of it as a quantum chaos diagnostic, i.e. as a tool to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. Using various variants of the SYK model, we study the signal of quantum chaos captured in the pseudo-entropy and relate it to the spectral form factor (SFF) and local operator entanglement (LOE). We also explore another quantity called the negativity of entanglement which is a useful entanglement measure for a mixed state. We generalized it to accommodate the transition matrix and called it pseudo-negativity in analogy to pseudo-entropy. We found that it also nicely captures the spectral properties of a chaotic system and hence also plays a role as a tool of quantum chaos diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Two $\beta$-ensemble realization of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models. We demonstrate that such a realization involves $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals, one of them providing a coupling to the external field. We also construct Ward identities in the corresponding two $\beta$-ensemble model, which requires a set of identities for partition function of the one $\beta$-ensemble in the external field, and a set of identities for the $\beta$-deformed Itzykson-Zuber integral. These both sets of identities are formulated in terms of the Dunkl operators.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral for Chord Diagrams and Chaotic-Integrable Transitions in Double Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

      <title>Real-time observables in de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Giant graviton expansion of Schur index and quasimodular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavored superconformal Schur index of $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM has finite $N$ corrections encoded in its giant graviton expansion in terms of D3 branes wrapped in $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$. The key element of this decomposition is the non-trivial index of the theory living on the wrapped brane system. A remarkable feature of the Schur limit is that the brane index is an analytic continuation of the flavored index of $\mathcal N=4$ $U(n)$ SYM, where $n$ is the total brane wrapping number. We exploit recent exact results about the Schur index of $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM to evaluate the closed form of the the brane indices appearing in the giant graviton expansion. Away from the unflavored limit, they are characterized by quasimodular forms providing exact information at all orders in the index universal fugacity. As an application of these results, we present novel exact expressions for the giant graviton expansion of the unflavored Schur index in a class of four dimensional $\mathcal N=2$ theories with equal central charges $a=c$, i.e. the non-Lagrangian theories $\widehat{\Gamma}(SU(N))$ with $\Gamma = E_{6}, E_{7}, E_{8}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolved Measures in Quantum Field Theory: a Short Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short review we present the key definitions, ideas and techniques involved in the study of symmetry resolved entanglement measures, with a focus on the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. In order to be able to define such entanglement measures, it is essential that the theory under study possess an internal symmetry. Then, symmetry resolved entanglement measures quantify the contribution to a particular entanglement measure that can be associated to a chosen symmetry sector. Our review focuses on conformal (gapless/massless/critical) and integrable (gapped/massive) quantum field theories, where the leading computational technique employs symmetry fields known as (composite) branch point twist fields.</description>

      <title>Topological solitons stabilized by a background gauge field and soliton-anti-soliton asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological lumps supported by the second homotopy group $\pi_2(S^2) \simeq {\mathbb Z}$ in a gauged $O(3)$ model without any potential term coupled with a (non)dynamical $U(1)$ gauge field. It is known that gauged-lumps are stable with an easy-plane potential term but are unstable to expand if the model has no potential term. In this paper, we find that these gauged lumps without a potential term can be made stable by putting them in a uniform magnetic field, irrespective of whether the gauge field is dynamical or not. In the case of the non-dynamical gauge field, only either of lumps or anti-lumps stably exists depending on the sign of the background magnetic field, and the other is unstable to shrink to be singular. We also construct coaxial multiple lumps whose size and mass exhibit a behaviour of droplets. In the case of the dynamical gauge field, both the lumps and anti-lumps stably exist with different masses; the lighter (heavier) one corresponds to the (un)stable one in the case of the nondynamical gauge field. We find that a lump behaves as a superconducting ring and traps magnetic field in its inside, with the total magnetic field reduced from the background magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold limit of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate a simple coordinate-space structure function $f_a(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to next-to-leading order in the large $N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin-representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions at leading and next-to-leading powers are naturally generated in their Borel representations. At leading power (LP), the factorization formula is explicitly verified, and the issue of ``scale-dependency'' of perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. At NLP, there are three series of non-perturbative functions and the related hard functions. The renormalon cancellation pattern between the hard function at LP and the non-perturbative function at NLP is verified explicitly. We also investigate the threshold expansion of the structure function and its relation to the twist expansion.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian R-symmetries in $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-Abelian R-symmetries in $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory, where fields may transform under the R-symmetry in representations with dimension higher than one. While a continuous non-Abelian R-symmetry can always be decomposed to a $U(1)$ R-symmetry and non-R symmetries, there are non-trivial discrete non-Abelian R-symmetries that do not admit such a decomposition, and effective R-charges cannot be defined in such models. Previous results on sufficient conditions for R-symmetric supersymmetric vacua in Wess-Zumino models still hold, and do not depend on fields in representations of dimension greater than one. However, fields in higher-dimensional representations enter the sufficient conditions for supersymmetric vacua that break R-symmetry, but it is difficult to identify the independent variables which can be used to solve the F-flatness equation in this case, unless other conditions are fulfilled. We present examples with discrete non-Abelian R-symmetries of the lowest order in this case.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
  We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.</description>

Abstract: The behaviour of the solutions of the time-fractional diffusion equation, based on the Caputo derivative, is studied and its dependence on the fractional exponent is analysed. The time-fractional convection-diffusion equation is also solved and an application to Pennes bioheat model is presented. Generically, a wave-like transport at short times passes over to a diffusion-like behaviour at later times.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational M\'enage \`a Trois: leptogenesis, primordial gravitational wave &amp; PBH-induced reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of %dynamically producing the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe uniquely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) that are formed in an inflaton-dominated background. Considering the inflaton $(\phi)$ to oscillate in a monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto\phi^n$, we show, it is possible to obtain the desired baryon asymmetry via vanilla leptogenesis from evaporating PBHs of initial mass $\lesssim 10$ g. We find that the allowed parameter space is heavily dependent on the shape of the inflaton potential during reheating (determined by the exponent of the potential $n$), the energy density of PBHs (determined by $\beta$), and the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM). To complete the minimal gravitational framework, we also include in our analysis the gravitational leptogenesis set-up through inflaton scattering via exchange of graviton, which opens up an even larger window for PBH mass, depending on the background equation of state. We finally illustrate that such gravitational leptogenesis scenarios can be tested with upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors, courtesy of the blue-tilted primordial GW with inflationary origin, thus paving a way to probe a PBH-induced reheating together with leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Spinfoams, $\gamma$-duality and parity violation in primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ appears as a coupling constant in the spinfoam dynamics of loop quantum gravity and can be understood as a measure of gravitational parity violation via a duality rotation. We investigate an effective field theory for gravity and a scalar field, with dynamics given by a $\gamma$-dual action obtained via a duality rotation of a parity-non-violating one. The resulting relation between the coupling constants of parity-even and parity-odd higher-curvature terms is determined by $\gamma$, opening the possibility of its measurement in the semiclassical regime. For a choice of $\gamma$-dual effective action, we study cosmic inflation and show that the observation of a primordial tensor polarization, together with the tensor tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, provides a measurement of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and, therefore, of the scale of discreteness of the quantum geometry of space.</description>

      <title>The Phenomenology of Sphaleron in Modified Mirror Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate sphaleron solutions of the field equations in the modified mirror model. This model is based on SU(3)$_1$ $\otimes$ SU(3)$_2$ $\otimes$ SU(2)$_L$ $\otimes$ SU(2)$_R$ $\otimes$ U(1)$_{Y}$ $\otimes$ U(1)$_{X}$ gauge group. Different from the usual Weinberg-Salam theory, we will have two types of fields, the ordinary (standard model) and its mirror partners. In this paper, we will focus only on the case when the doublet scalar of the mirror sector has a very large vacuum expectation value (VEV) compared to the VEV of the SM Higgs. We study two scenarios related to the sphaleron solutions in this model, depending on the value of the coupling $\alpha$. For the case of $\alpha=0$, each sector has its sphaleron and the sphaleron energy depends on the VEV of scalars for each sector. In the case $\alpha \neq 0$, we find that the sphaleron energy in the SM sector can be either increased or decreased depending on the relative sign of the coupling $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Towards verifications of Krylov complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity is considered to provide a measure of the growth of operators evolving under Hamiltonian dynamics. The main strategy is the analysis of the structure of Krylov subspace $\mathcal{K}_M(\mathcal{H},\eta)$ spanned by the multiple applications of the Liouville operator $\mathcal{L}$ defined by the commutator in terms of a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathcal{L}:=[\mathcal{H},\cdot]$ acting on an operator $\eta$, $\mathcal{K}_M(\mathcal{H},\eta)=\text{span}\{\eta,\mathcal{L}\eta,\ldots,\mathcal{L}^{M-1}\eta\}$. For a given inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$ of the operators, the orthonormal basis $\{\mathcal{O}_n\}$ is constructed from $\mathcal{O}_0=\eta/\sqrt{(\eta,\eta)}$ by Lanczos algorithm. The moments $\mu_m=(\mathcal{O}_0,\mathcal{L}^m\mathcal{O}_0)$ are closely related to the important data $\{b_n\}$ called Lanczos coefficients. I present the exact and explicit expressions of the moments $\{\mu_m\}$ for 16 quantum mechanical systems which are {\em exactly solvable both in the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures}. The operator $\eta$ is the sinusoidal coordinate which is the variable of the eigenpolynomials $\{P_n(\eta)\}$ of the exactly solvable Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$.</description>

      <title>Study of dark matter scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei within chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dark matter, assumed to be composed by weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs), scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei. In order to parameterize the WIMP-nucleon interaction the chiral effective field theory approach is used. Considering only interactions invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal, we examine five interaction types: scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial and tensor. Scattering amplitudes between two nucleons and a WIMP are determined up to second order of chiral perturbation theory. We apply this program to calculate the interaction rate as function of the WIMP mass and of the magnitude of the WIMP-quark coupling constants. From our study, we conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions result much greater than the others due to theirs large combination of low energy constants. We verify that the leading order contributions are dominant in this low energy processes. We also provide an estimate for the background due to atmospheric neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in Krylov Basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization for closed non-integrable quantum systems in the Krylov basis. Following the idea of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, one may introduce Krylov basis thermalization hypothesis which imposes a condition on the matrix elements of local operators in the Krylov basis. In this context, the nature of thermalization may be probed by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. We also compute the variance of Lanczos coefficients which may provide another quantity to examine the nature of thermalization. We will see that there is a direct relation between the behavior of the infinite time average of complexity and that of the inverse participation ratio of initial states.</description>

      <title>From S-matrix theory to strings: Scattering data and the commitment to non-arbitrariness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early history of string theory is marked by a shift from strong interaction physics to quantum gravity. The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the "hadronic string theory"), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to "non-arbitrariness", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that initially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the practical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum gravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of experimental data in string theory.</description>

      <title>QED Effects on Kerr-Newman Black Hole Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

      <title>On minimal entanglement wedge cross section for holographic entanglement negativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.10272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the equivalence of two different conjectures in the literature for the holographic entanglement negativity in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, modulo certain constants. These proposals involve certain algebraic sums of bulk geodesics homologous to specific combinations of subsystems, and the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) backreacted by a cosmic brane for the conical defect geometry in the bulk gravitational path integral. It is observed that the former conjectures reproduce the field theory replica technique results in the large central charge limit whereas the latter involves constants related to the Markov gap. In this context we establish an alternative construction for the EWCS of a single interval in a CFT$_2$ at a finite temperature to resolve an issue for the latter proposal involving the thermal entropy elimination for the holographic entanglement negativity. Our construction for the EWCS correctly reproduces the corresponding field theory results modulo the Markov gap constant in the large central charge limit.</description>

      <title>MHV amplitudes and BCFW recursion for Yang-Mills theory in the de Sitter static patch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scattering problem in the static patch of de Sitter space, i.e. the problem of field evolution between the past and future horizons of a de Sitter observer. We formulate the problem in terms of off-shell fields in Poincare coordinates. This is especially convenient for conformal theories, where the static patch can be viewed as a flat causal diamond, with one tip at the origin and the other at timelike infinity. As an important example, we consider Yang-Mills theory at tree level. We find that static-patch scattering for Yang-Mills is subject to BCFW-like recursion relations. These can reduce any static-patch amplitude to one with N^{-1}MHV helicity structure, dressed by ordinary Minkowski amplitudes. We derive all the N^{-1}MHV static-patch amplitudes from self-dual Yang-Mills field solutions. Using the recursion relations, we then derive from these an infinite set of MHV amplitudes, with arbitrary number of external legs.</description>

Abstract: We study entanglement negativity for evaporating black hole based on the holographic model with defect brane. We introduce a defect extremal surface formula for entanglement negativity. Based on partial reduction, we show the equivalence between defect extremal surface formula and island formula for entanglement negativity in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. Extending the study to the model of eternal black hole plus CFT bath, we find that black hole-black hole negativity decreases until vanishing, left black hole-left radiation negativity is always a constant, radiation-radiation negativity increases and then saturates at a time later than Page time. In all the time dependent cases, defect extremal surface formula agrees with island formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the full phase diagram of a non-Hermitian PT-symmetric generalization of the paradigmatic two-dimensional massive Thirring model. Employing the non-perturbative functional renormalization-group, we find that the model hosts a regime where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. This new phase is characterized by a relevant imaginary mass, corresponding to monstronic excitations displaying exponentially growing amplitudes for time-like intervals and tachyonic (Lieb-Robison-bound breaking, oscillatory) excitations for space-like intervals. Furthermore, since the phase manifests itself as an unconventional attractive spinodal fixed point, which is typically unreachable in finite real-life systems, we find that the effective renormalized mass reached can be tuned through the microscopic parameters of the model. Our results further predict that the new phase is robust to external gauge fields, contrary to the celebrated BKT phase in the PT unbroken sector. The gauge field then provides an effective and easy means to tune the renormalized imaginary mass through a wide range of values, and therefore the amplitude growth/oscillation rate of the corresponding excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute and clarify the interpretation of the on-shell Euclidean action for Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes in de Sitter space. We show the on-shell action is minus the sum of the black hole and cosmological horizon entropy for arbitrary mass and charge in any number of dimensions. This unifying expression helps to clear up a confusion about the Euclidean actions of extremal and ultracold black holes in de Sitter, as they can be understood as special cases of the general expression. We then use this result to estimate the probability for the pair creation of black holes with arbitrary mass and charge in an empty de Sitter background, by employing the formalism of constrained instantons. Finally, we suggest that the decay of charged de Sitter black holes is governed by the gradient flow of the entropy function and that, as a consequence, the regime of light, superradiant, rapid charge emission should describe the potential decay of extreme charged Nariai black holes to singular geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review a geometrical, so called superembedding, approach to the description of the dynamics of point-like and extended supersymmetric objects (superbranes) in String Theory. The approach is based on a supersymmetric extension of the classical surface theory to the description of superbrane dynamics by means of embedding worldvolume supersurfaces into target superspaces. Lorentz harmonics, twistors and pure spinors are its intrinsic ingredients. Main new results obtained with this approach include the following ones. Being manifestly doubly supersymmetric (on the worldvolume and in target superspace) the superembedding approach explained that the local fermionic kappa-symmetry of the Green-Schwarz-like superbrane actions originates from the conventional local supersymmetry of the worldvolume. It established or clarified a classical relationship between various formulations of the dynamics of superparticles and superstrings, such as the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond and the Green-Schwarz formulation. The full set of the equations of motion of the M-theory five-brane was first derived with the use of this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum modular properties of $\widehat Z{}^G$-invariants of closed three-manifolds. Higher depth quantum modular forms are expected to play a central role for general three-manifolds and gauge groups $G$. In particular, we conjecture that for plumbed three-manifolds whose plumbing graphs have $n$ junction nodes with definite signature and for rank $r$ gauge group $G$, that $\widehat Z{}^G$ is related to a quantum modular form of depth $nr$. We prove this for $G={\rm SU}(3)$ and for an infinite class of three-manifolds (weakly negative Seifert with three exceptional fibers). We also investigate the relation between the quantum modularity of $\widehat Z{}^G$-invariants of the same three-manifold with different gauge group $G$. We conjecture a recursive relation among the iterated Eichler integrals relevant for $\widehat Z{}^G$ with $G={\rm SU}(2)$ and ${\rm SU}(3)$, for negative Seifert manifolds with three exceptional fibers. This is reminiscent of the recursive structure among mock modular forms playing the role of Vafa-Witten invariants for ${\rm SU}(N)$. We prove the conjecture when the three-manifold is moreover an integral homological sphere.</description>

Abstract: We investigate various aspects of the Lanczos coefficients in a family of free Lifshitz scalar theories, characterized by their integer dynamical exponent, at finite temperature. In this non-relativistic setup, we examine the effects of mass, finite ultraviolet cutoff, and finite lattice spacing on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients. We also investigate the effect of the dynamical exponent on the asymptotic behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, which show a universal scaling behavior. We carefully examine how these results can affect different measures in Krylov space, including Krylov complexity and entropy. Remarkably, we find that our results are similar to those previously observed in the literature for relativistic theories.</description>

Abstract: We study nonperturbative effects of quantum gravity in a system consisting of a coupled pair of holographic CFTs. The AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ system has three possible ground states: two copies of empty AdS, a pair of extremal AdS black holes, and an eternal AdS traversable wormhole. We give a recipe for calculating transition rates via gravitational instantons and test it by calculating the emission rate of radiation shells from a black hole. We calculate the nucleation rate of a traversable wormhole between a pair of AdS-RN black holes in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. Our results give predictions of nonpertubative quantum gravity that can be tested in a holographic simulation.</description>

Abstract: We study $6$d $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ supergravity theories arising in the frozen phase of F-theory. For each of the known global models, we construct an F-theory compactification in the unfrozen phase with an identical non-abelian gauge algebra and massless matter content. Two such low energy effective theories are then distinguished through gauge enhancements in moduli space. We study potentially new global models obtained via compact embeddings of a plethora of $6$d $\mathcal{N}= (1,0)$ superconformal field theories and little string theories constructed using frozen $7$-branes. In some cases, these provably do not exist, and in other cases, we explicitly construct a compact embedding, yielding $6$d supergravity theories with new massless spectra. Finally, by using gravitational anomaly cancellation, we conjecture the existence of localized neutral hypermultiplets along frozen $7$-brane loci.</description>

Abstract: Dipole charge conservation forces isolated charges to be immobile fractons. These couple naturally to spatial two-index symmetric tensor gauge fields that resemble a spatial metric. We propose a spacetime Lorentz covariant version of dipole symmetry and study the theory of the associated gauge fields. In the presence of a suitable background field, these contain a massive anti-symmetric and a massless symmetric two-index tensors. The latter transforms only under longitudinal diffeomorphisms, making the massless sector similar to linearized gravity, but with additional modes of lower spin. We show that the theory can be consistently coupled to a curved background metric and study its possible interaction terms with itself and with matter. In addition, we construct a map between solutions of linearized gravity in Kerr-Schild form and solutions of fracton gravity coupled to matter.</description>

      <title>Warped Conformal Symmetries of the Accelerating Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies on the holographic descriptions of Kerr black holes indicate that the conformal or the warped conformal symmetries are responsible for the Kerr black hole physics at both background and perturbation levels. In the present paper, we extend the validity of these studies to the case of accelerating Kerr black hole. By invoking a set of non-trivial diffeomorphisms near the horizon bifurcation surface of the accelerating Kerr black hole, the Dirac brackets among charges of the diffeomorphisms form the symmetry algebra of a warped CFT which consists of one Virasoro and one Kac-Moody algebra with central extensions. This provides the evidence for warped CFTs being possible holographic dual to accelerating Kerr black holes. The thermal entropy formula of the warped CFT fixed by modular parameters and vacuum charges reproduces the entropy of the rotating black hole with acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize our work on a consistency condition for inflation in two-field cosmological models, in the regime of rapid turn and third-order slow roll. To ensure a sustained inflationary period of this type, one needs to satisfy a certain relation between the scalar potential and the scalar field-space metric. We explain the derivation of this condition. Furthermore, we argue that, generically, the rapid-turn phase tends to be short-lived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method to compute the gravitational form factor $D(Q^2)$ in holographic QCD by exploiting the remarkable correspondence between semi-classical light-front QCD and semi-classical field theories in wrapped spacetime in 5D. The use of light-front holography bridges physics at large $Q^2$ as attained in light-front QCD and physics at small $Q^2$ where the coupling to scalar and tensor fields, i.e. glueballs, are dominant. As an application, we compute the $D$-term for the pion, and compare the results with recent lattice simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we discuss the bulk reconstruction of massless free fields in flat space from the highest-weight representation of boundary Carrollian conformal field theory (CCFT). We expand the bulk field as a sum of infinite descendants of a primary state defined in the boundary CCFT, and discuss the Lorentz invariant bulk-boundary propagator in detail for the BMS_3/CCFT_2 case. In our calculation, it is necessary to introduce a nonzero mass at the beginning and take it as vanishing at the end. The framework we proposed has the potential to probe local bulk physics from the boundary CCFT.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k} \ \oplus \ {\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,1}$ highest weight representations for generic level $k$ and equivalence between two dimensional CFT models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct highest weight vectors of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$ in tensor products of highest weight modules of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$ and ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,1}$, and thus for generic weights we find the decomposition of the tensor product into irreducibles of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$. The construction uses Wakimoto representations of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$, but the obtained vectors can be mapped back to Verma modules. Singularities of this mapping are cancelled by a renormalization. A detailed study of ``degenerations'' of Wakimoto modules allowed to find the renormalization factor explicitly. The obtained result is a significant step forward in a proof of equivalence of certain two-dimesnional CFT models.</description>

      <title>Bulk reconstruction using timelike entanglement in (A)dS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the entanglement entropies for spacelike subregions, and the associated modular Hamiltonians play a crucial role in the bulk reconstruction program within Anti de-Sitter (AdS) holography. Explicit examples of HKLL map exist mostly for the cases where the emergent bulk region is the so-called entanglement wedge of the given boundary subregion. However, motivated from the complex pseudo-entropy in Euclidean conformal field theories (CFT), one can talk about a `timelike entanglement' in Lorentzian CFTs dual to AdS spacetimes. One can then utilize this boundary timelike entanglement to define a boundary `timelike modular Hamiltonian'. We use constraints involving these Hamiltonians in a manner similar to how it was used for spacelike cases, and write down bulk operators in regions which are not probed by an RT surface corresponding to a single CFT. In the context of two dimensional CFT, we re-derive the HKLL formulas for free bulk scalar fields in three examples: in AdS Poincar\'{e} patch, inside and outside of the AdS black hole, and for de Sitter flat slicings. In this method, one no longer requires the knowledge of bulk dynamics for sub-horizon holography.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate how black hole quasi-normal modes can emerge from a Dirichlet brickwall model normal modes. We consider a probe scalar field in a BTZ geometry with a Dirichlet brickwall and demonstrate that as the wall approaches the event horizon, the corresponding poles in the retarded correlator become dense and yield an effective branch-cut. The associated discontinuity of the correlator carries the information of the black hole quasi-normal modes. We further demonstrate that a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively enhances the pole-condensing. We hypothesize that it is also related to quantum chaotic features of the corresponding spectral form factor, which has been observed earlier. Finally, we discuss the underlying algebraic justification of this approximate thermalization in terms of the trace of the algebra.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational plane waves (when Ricci flat) belong to the VSI family. The achronym VSI stands for vanishing scalar invariants, meaning that all scalar invariants built out of Riemann tensor and its derivatives vanish, although the Riemann tensor itself does not. In the particular case of plane waves many interesting phenomena have been uncovered for strings propagating in this background. Here we comment on gravitons propagating in such a spacetime, which itself presumably consists of an Avogadro number of such gravitons.</description>

      <title>Observables from classical black hole scattering in Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity from worldline quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit. We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some analytical results using stationary phase approximation. Interestingly, we also show that the $\lambda_4 \varphi^4$ interaction vertex does not contribute to the radiation by showing that the integral has no non-zero finite value.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze higher Schwarzians and show that they are closely related to the nonlinear realization of the Virasoro algebra. The Goldstone fields of such a realization provide a new set of SL(2,R) invariant higher Schwarzians that are deeply related to the Aharonov,Tamanoi and Bonora-Matone ones. A minor change of the coset space parametrization leads to a new set of SL(2,R) non-invariant higher Schwarzians now related to the Schippers and Bertilsson Schwarzians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genus one amplitude for topological strings on Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be computed using mirror symmetry: The partition function at genus one gets mapped to a holomorphic version of Ray-Singer torsion on the mirror Calabi-Yau. On the other hand it can be shown by a physical argument that this gives a curvature squared correction term to the gravitational action. This in paticular leads to an effective quantum gravity cutoff known as the species scale, which varies over moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds. This resolves some of the puzzles associated to the entropy of small black holes when there are a large number of light species of particles. Thus Ray-Singer torsion, via its connection to topological strings at genus one, provides a measure of light degrees of freedom of four dimensional N=2 supergravity theories. Based on a talk given on May 12th, 2023 at the Singer Memorial Conference, MIT.</description>

Abstract: The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$ trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with non-integer powers.</description>

Abstract: In the context of weak-field metric-affine (i.e. Palatini) gravity near Minkowski spacetime, we compute the particle spectra in the simultaneous presence of all independent contractions quadratic in Ricci-type tensors. Apart from the full metric-affine geometry, we study kinematic limits with vanishing torsion (i.e. a symmetric connection) and vanishing non-metricity (i.e. a metric connection, which is physically indistinguishable from Poincar\'e gauge theory at the level of the particle spectrum). We present a detailed report on how spin-parity projection operators can be used to derive systematically and unambiguously the character of the propagating states. The unitarity constraints derived from the requirements of tachyon- and ghost-freedom are obtained. We show that, even in the presence of all Ricci-type operators, only a narrow selection of viable theories emerges by a tuning.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce a method for calculating holographic duals of BCFTs with more than two boundaries. We apply it to calculating the dynamics of entanglement entropy in a 1+1d CFT that is instantaneously split into multiple segments and calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of time for the case of two splits, showing that our approach reproduces earlier results for the double split case. Our manuscript lays the groundwork for future calculations of the entanglement entropy for more than two splits and systems at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>New aspect of chiral and axial breaking in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry in QCD is stricter than the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, simply because of the presence of the quantum axial anomaly. If the QCD gauge coupling is sent to zero, the strength of the $U(1)$ axial breaking coincides with that of the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, which we shall in short call an axial-chiral coincidence. This coincidence is trivial since QCD then becomes a non-interacting theory. Actually, there exists another limit in the QCD parameter space, where an axial-chiral coincidence occurs even with nonzero QCD gauge coupling, that can be dubbed a nontrivial coincidence: it is the case with the massive light quarks $(m_l\neq 0)$ and the massless strange quark ($m_s=0$), due to the flavor-singlet nature of the topological susceptibility. This coincidence is robust and tied to the anomalous chiral Ward-Takahashi identity, which is operative even at hot QCD. This implies that the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry is restored simultaneously with the $U(1)$ axial symmetry at high temperatures. This simultaneous restoration is independent of $m_l (\neq 0)$, hence is irrespective to the order of the chiral phase transition. In this paper, we discuss how the real-life QCD can be evolved from the nontrivial chiral-axial coincidence limit, by working on a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the $U(1)$ axial anomaly contribution properly incorporated. It is shown that at high temperatures the large differences between the restorations of the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry and the $U(1)$ axial symmetry for two light quarks and a sufficiently large current mass for the strange quark is induced by a significant interference of the topological susceptibility. Thus the deviation from the nontrivial coincidence, which is monitored by the strange quark mass controlling the topological susceptibility, provides a new way of understanding the chiral $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ axial breaking in QCD.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transition of Operator Size Growth in Quantum Systems Embedded in an Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In closed generic many-body systems, unitary evolution disperses local quantum information into highly non-local objects, resulting in thermalization. Such a process is called information scrambling, whose swiftness is quantified by the operator size growth. However, for quantum systems embedded in an environment, how the couplings to the environment affect the process of information scrambling quests revelation. Here we predict a dynamical transition in quantum systems with all-to-all interactions accompanied by an environment, which separates two phases. In the dissipative phase, information scrambling halts as the operator size decays with time, while in the scrambling phase, dispersion of information persists and the operator size grows and saturates to an $O(N)$ value in the long-time limit with $N$ the number of degrees of freedom of the systems. The transition is driven by the competition between the system intrinsic and environment propelled scramblings and the environment induced dissipation. Our prediction is derived from a general argument based on epidemiological models and demonstrated analytically via solvable Brownian SYK models. We provide further evidence which suggests that the transition is generic to quantum chaotic systems when coupled to an environment. Our study sheds light on the fundamental behavior of quantum systems in the presence of an environment.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle for Entangled States of Two Identical Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we determine the consequences of the quantum entanglement of a system of two identical particles when the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is considered. GUP is usually associated with the existence of a minimal length. We focus on the main formulations of the GUP and then we determine the minimal uncertainties in position induced by those modified GUP's. Our results point out that the minimal uncertainty is reduced by half of its usual value independently of the GUP employed. This implies that the minimal length is also reduced by half. On the other hand, it is generally expected that the minimal length must not depend on physical system. We overcome this apparent paradox by realizing that the entangled system is composed by two particles so that an effective parameter related to the minimal length must be employed.</description>

      <title>Null Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory: Soft symmetries and memory as superselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft symmetries for Yang-Mills theory are shown to correspond to the residual Hamiltonian action of the gauge group on the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space, which is the result of a partial symplectic reduction. The associated momentum map is the electromagnetic memory in the abelian theory, or a nonlinear, gauge-equivariant, generalization thereof in the nonabelian case.
  This result follows from an application of Hamiltonian reduction by stages, enabled by the existence of a natural normal subgroup of the gauge group on a null codimension-1 submanifold with boundaries. The first stage is coisotropic reduction of the Gauss constraint, and it yields a symplectic extension of the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space (up to a covering). Hamiltonian reduction of the residual gauge action leads to the fully-reduced phase space of the theory. This is a Poisson manifold, whose symplectic leaves, called superselection sectors, are labelled by the (gauge classes of the generalized) electric flux across the boundary.
  In this framework, the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space arises as an intermediate reduction stage that enforces the superselection of the electric flux at only one of the two boundary components. These results provide a natural, purely Hamiltonian, explanation of the existence of soft symmetries as a byproduct of partial symplectic reduction, as well as a motivation for the expected decomposition of the quantum Hilbert space of states into irreducible representations labelled by the Casimirs of the Poisson structure on the reduced phase space.</description>

      <title>Self-dual gravity in de Sitter space: lightcone ansatz and static-patch scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Krasnov's formulation of General Relativity (GR), we develop a lightcone ansatz for self-dual gravity (along with linearized anti-self-dual perturbations) in the Poincare patch of de Sitter space. This amounts to a generalization of Plebanski's "second heavenly equation" to non-zero cosmological constant. The only interaction vertices are cubic ones, found previously by Metsaev in a bottom-up lightcone approach. We point out a special feature of these vertices, which leads to "almost conservation" of energy at each successive order in perturbation theory, despite the time-dependent de Sitter background. Since we embed the lightcone variables into a full spacetime metric, the solutions have a clear geometric interpretation. In particular, this allows us to read off boundary data on both the past and future horizons of a causal (static) patch. In this way, we add self-dual GR to the program of defining &amp; computing scattering amplitudes in a causal patch of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIa. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}$ - $E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies as obstructions to gauging (non-on-site) symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. We consider anomalies in internal and lattice translation symmetries. We derive a microscopic formula for the "anomaly cocycle" using topological defects implementing twisted boundary conditions. The anomaly takes value in the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1)) \times H^2(G,U(1))$. The first factor captures the anomaly in the internal symmetry group $G$, and the second factor corresponds to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly involving $G$ and lattice translation. We present a systematic procedure to gauge internal symmetries (that may not act on-site) on the lattice. We show that the anomaly cocycle is the obstruction to gauging the internal symmetry while preserving the lattice translation symmetry. As an application, we construct anomaly-free chiral lattice gauge theories. We demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between (locality-preserving) symmetry operators and topological defects, which is essential for the results we prove. We also discuss the generalization to fermionic theories. Finally, we construct non-invertible lattice translation symmetries by gauging internal symmetries with a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark matter with momentum and energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges.The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.332^{+1.246}_{-0.237}$ and $Q =-0.0312^{+0.0312}_{-0.0085}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Capping the positivity cone: dimension-8 Higgs operators in the SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SMEFT Wilson coefficients are subject to various positivity bounds in order to be consistent with the fundamental principles of S-matrix. Previous bounds on dimension-8 SMEFT operators have been obtained using the positivity part of UV partial wave unitarity and form a (projective) convex cone. We derive a set of linear UV unitarity conditions that go beyond positivity and are easy to implement in an optimization scheme with dispersion relations in a multi-field EFT. Using Higgs scattering as an example, we demonstrate how to obtain closed bounds in the space of the three relevant dimension-8 coefficients, making use of the UV unitarity conditions as well as so-called null constraints that arise from full crossing symmetry. Specifically, we show that they are bounded by inequalities schematically going like $C&lt;O\left((4\pi)^2\right)$. We compare the newly obtained upper bounds with the traditional perturbative unitarity bounds from within the EFT, and discuss some phenomenological implications of the two-sided positivity bounds in the context of experimental probes of Vector Boson Scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac spin liquid (DSL) is a two-dimensional (2D) fractionalized Mott insulator featuring massless Dirac spinon excitations coupled to a compact $U(1)$ gauge field, which allows for flux-tunneling instanton events described by magnetic monopoles in (2+1)D Euclidean spacetime. The state-operator correspondence of conformal field theory has been used recently to define associated monopole operators and determine their quantum numbers, which encode the microscopic symmetries of conventional ordered phases proximate to the DSL. In this work, we utilize semiclassical instanton methods not relying on conformal invariance to construct monopole operators directly in (2+1)D spacetime as instanton-induced 't Hooft vertices, i.e., fermion-number-violating effective interactions originating from zero modes of the Euclidean Dirac operator in an instanton background. In the presence of a flavor-adjoint fermion mass, resummation of the instanton gas is shown to select the correct monopole to be proliferated, in accordance with predictions of the state-operator correspondence. We also show that our instanton-based approach is able to determine monopole quantum numbers on bipartite lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite a long history of studies of vortex crystals in rotating superfluids, their melting due to quantum fluctuations is poorly understood. Here we develop a fracton-elasticity duality to investigate a two-dimensional vortex lattice within the fast rotation regime, where the Lifshitz model of the collective Tkachenko mode serves as the leading-order low-energy effective theory. We incorporate topological defects and discuss several quantum melting scenarios triggered by their proliferation. Furthermore, we lay the groundwork for a dual non-linear emergent gravity description of the superfluid vortex crystals.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals and spin structures in interacting chains in and out of equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance. We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their (large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering at the Large Hadron Collider has revived interest in this fundamental process, and especially of the accurate prediction of its cross-section, which we present here for the first time at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in both QCD and QED. We compare two radically different computational approaches, both exact in the fermion mass dependence, thus offering a strong cross-check of our results. The first approach is a fully analytic method to calculate compact and well-organized two-loop helicity amplitudes. The second one is entirely numerical and leverages the Local Unitarity construction. Our two calculations agree with each other and conclude that including the exact fermion mass contribution typically increases the size of the NLO corrections. Moreover, we find that the exact result converges slowly to the massless limit of the high-energy regime, thus emphasizing the importance of including the full mass dependence at NLO. We also compare our results with the ATLAS measurement of LbL in ultra-peripheral lead-lead collisions, and find that the inclusion of exact NLO corrections reduces, but does not eliminate, the existing tension with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the seemingly different methods used to derive non-Lorentzian (Galilean and Carrollian) gravitational theories from Lorentzian ones are equivalent. Specifically, the pre-nonrelativistic and the pre-ultralocal parametrizations can be constructed from the gauging of the Galilei and Carroll algebras, respectively. Also, the pre-ultralocal approach of taking the Carrollian limit is equivalent to performing the ADM decomposition and then setting the signature of the Lorentzian manifold to zero. We use this uniqueness to write a generic expansion for the curvature tensors and construct Galilean and Carrollian limits of all metric theories of gravity of finite order ranging from the $f(R)$ gravity to a completely generic higher derivative theory, the $f(g_{\mu\nu},R_{\mu\nu\sigma \rho},\nabla_{\mu})$ gravity. We present an algorithm for calculation of the $n$-th order of the Galilean and Carrollian expansions that transforms this problem into a constrained optimization problem. We also derive the condition under which a gravitational theory becomes a modification of general relativity in both limits simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading conjecture for the emergence of statistical mechanics in generic isolated quantum systems and is formulated in terms of the matrix elements of operators. An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that entanglement velocities, which govern the spreading of entanglement, are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On affine Toda field theories related to ${\bf D}_r$ algebras and their real Hamiltonian forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with affine 2-dimensional Toda field theories related to simple Lie algebras of the classical series ${\bf D}_r$. We demonstrate that the complexification procedure followed by a restriction to a specified real Hamiltonian form commutes with the external automorphisms of $\mathfrak{g}$. This is illustrated on the examples ${\bf D}_{r+1}^{(1)} \to {\bf B}_r^{(1)}$ and ${\bf D}_4^{(1)} \to {\bf G}_2^{(1)}$ using external automorphisms of the corresponding extended Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Affleck-Dine Dirac Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal framework that realises successful Dirac Leptogenesis through the Affleck-Dine mechanism. A single right-handed neutrino and a neutrinophillic Higgs doublet are introduced to the Standard Model, which couple via a Yukawa interaction. The inflationary setting is induced by a combination of the two Higgs doublets, with their global symmetry violating interactions leading to a net charge generation via the Affleck-Dine mechanism. This simple Standard Model extension exhibits a unique and connected set of phenomenological implications including the resultant baryon asymmetry, inflationary predictions, cosmological implications, relic right-handed neutrinos, and its low energy phenomenology, while also being able to be embedded in various neutrino mass generating mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Workshop on the limiting compactness objects: Black holes and Buchdahl stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The workshop was organized at IUCAA on Oct 30 - Nov 3, 2023 as a compact discussion and discourse meeting with a threadbare exposition and discussion of the various aspects and the questions arising. It was occasioned by the visit of Professor Hakan Andreasson of the Gothenburg Technical University, Sweden. He has been exploring with his collaborators the Einstein - Vlasov system for over a decade and a half as a possible matter source for compact objects. This system characterizes itself by free particles in motion and interacting only through gravity. For a limiting compactness, this may be the most appropriate state. The main thrust of the workshop was to understand this new object, Buchdahl Star (BS), of limiting compactness without a horizon. It is almost as compact as a black hole (BH) and yet has no horizon and hence is open for interaction with the outside world. Ever since the proposal of the membrane paradigm envisaging a timelike fiducial surface near BH horizon, BS offers an excellent possibility of the existence of such a real astrophysical object. It could very well compete with BH as a mimicker for various physical and astrophysical phenomena. Thus, it opens up a new vista of study and investigation of all the questions that one asks for BH, for this new creature, BS. The workshop was intended to identify certain interesting questions as well as the people interested in studying them. On this count, the workshop has been a huge success as several interesting questions have been identified, a few groups have been formed to take up different problems, and the work has already started. Nothing more could one have asked from such an exercise. A brief summary of some of the talks is included, followed by a brief discussion of the projects identified as a result of the discussions during the workshop.</description>

      <title>Reclaiming the Lost Conformality in a non-Hermitian Quantum 5-state Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal symmetry, emerging at critical points, can be lost when renormalization group fixed points collide. Recently, it was proposed that after collisions, real fixed points transition into the complex plane, becoming complex fixed points described by complex conformal field theories (CFTs). Although this idea is compelling, directly demonstrating such complex conformal fixed points in microscopic models remains highly demanding. Furthermore, these concrete models are instrumental in unraveling the mysteries of complex CFTs and illuminating a variety of intriguing physical problems, including weakly first-order transitions in statistical mechanics and the conformal window of gauge theories. In this work, we have successfully addressed this complex challenge for the (1+1)-dimensional quantum $5$-state Potts model, whose phase transition has long been known to be weakly first-order. By adding an additional non-Hermitian interaction, we successfully identify two conjugate critical points located in the complex parameter space, where the lost conformality is restored in a complex manner. Specifically, we unambiguously demonstrate the radial quantization of the complex CFTs and compute the operator spectrum, as well as new operator product expansion coefficients that were previously unknown.</description>

      <title>Birdtracks of Exotic SU(N) Color Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I introduce a systematic procedure for constructing complete and independent sets of interactions of fields transforming under exotic representations of SU(N), in particular the SU(3) gauge group of QCD. It uncovers errors in previous results, starting with interactions of four fields including a single sextet.</description>
