      <title>Flows, straight but not so fast: Exploring the design space of Rectified Flows in Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling techniques such as Diffusion and Flow Matching have achieved significant successes in generating designable and diverse protein backbones. However, many current models are computationally expensive, requiring hundreds or even thousands of function evaluations (NFEs) to yield samples of acceptable quality, which can become a bottleneck in practical design campaigns that often generate $10^4\ -\ 10^6$ designs per target. In image generation, Rectified Flows (ReFlow) can significantly reduce the required NFEs for a given target quality, but their application in protein backbone generation has been less studied. We apply ReFlow to improve the low NFE performance of pretrained SE(3) flow matching models for protein backbone generation and systematically study ReFlow design choices in the context of protein generation in data curation, training and inference time settings. In particular, we (1) show that ReFlow in the protein domain is particularly sensitive to the choice of coupling generation and annealing, (2) demonstrate how useful design choices for ReFlow in the image domain do not directly translate to better performance on proteins, and (3) make improvements to ReFlow methodology for proteins.</description>

      <title>EnzyControl: Adding Functional and Substrate-Specific Control for Enzyme Backbone Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing enzyme backbones with substrate-specific functionality is a critical challenge in computational protein engineering. Current generative models excel in protein design but face limitations in binding data, substrate-specific control, and flexibility for de novo enzyme backbone generation. To address this, we introduce EnzyBind, a dataset with 11,100 experimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs specifically curated from PDBbind. Building on this, we propose EnzyControl, a method that enables functional and substrate-specific control in enzyme backbone generation. Our approach generates enzyme backbones conditioned on MSA-annotated catalytic sites and their corresponding substrates, which are automatically extracted from curated enzyme-substrate data. At the core of EnzyControl is EnzyAdapter, a lightweight, modular component integrated into a pretrained motif-scaffolding model, allowing it to become substrate-aware. A two-stage training paradigm further refines the model's ability to generate accurate and functional enzyme structures. Experiments show that our EnzyControl achieves the best performance across structural and functional metrics on EnzyBind and EnzyBench benchmarks, with particularly notable improvements of 13\% in designability and 13\% in catalytic efficiency compared to the baseline models. The code is released at https://github.com/Vecteur-libre/EnzyControl.</description>

      <title>OmegAMP: Targeted AMP Discovery through Biologically Informed Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery faces critical challenges such as limited controllability, lack of representations that efficiently model antimicrobial properties, and low experimental hit rates. To address these challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework designed for reliable AMP generation with increased controllability. Its diffusion-based generative model leverages a novel conditioning mechanism to achieve fine-grained control over desired physicochemical properties and to direct generation towards specific activity profiles, including species-specific effectiveness. This is further enhanced by a biologically informed encoding space that significantly improves overall generative performance. Complementing these generative capabilities, OmegAMP leverages a novel synthetic data augmentation strategy to train classifiers for AMP filtering, drastically reducing false positive rates and thereby increasing the likelihood of experimental success. Our in silico experiments demonstrate that OmegAMP delivers state-of-the-art performance across key stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, enabling us to achieve an unprecedented success rate in wet lab experiments. We tested 25 candidate peptides, 24 of them (96%) demonstrated antimicrobial activity, proving effective even against multi-drug resistant strains. Our findings underscore OmegAMP's potential to significantly advance computational frameworks in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.</description>
