      <title>A Dual-Tier Adaptive One-Class Classification IDS for Emerging Cyberthreats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital age, our dependence on IoT (Internet of Things) and IIoT (Industrial IoT) systems has grown immensely, which facilitates sensitive activities such as banking transactions and personal, enterprise data, and legal document exchanges. Cyberattackers consistently exploit weak security measures and tools. The Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) acts as a primary tool against such cyber threats. However, machine learning-based IDSs, when trained on specific attack patterns, often misclassify new emerging cyberattacks. Further, the limited availability of attack instances for training a supervised learner and the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats further complicate the matter. This emphasizes the need for an adaptable IDS framework capable of recognizing and learning from unfamiliar/unseen attacks over time. In this research, we propose a one-class classification-driven IDS system structured on two tiers. The first tier distinguishes between normal activities and attacks/threats, while the second tier determines if the detected attack is known or unknown. Within this second tier, we also embed a multi-classification mechanism coupled with a clustering algorithm. This model not only identifies unseen attacks but also uses them for retraining them by clustering unseen attacks. This enables our model to be future-proofed, capable of evolving with emerging threat patterns. Leveraging one-class classifiers (OCC) at the first level, our approach bypasses the need for attack samples, addressing data imbalance and zero-day attack concerns and OCC at the second level can effectively separate unknown attacks from the known attacks. Our methodology and evaluations indicate that the presented framework exhibits promising potential for real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Classification for Intrusion Detection System: Effective Design and Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increased use of network technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) in many real-world applications, new types of cyberattacks have been emerging. To safeguard critical infrastructures from these emerging threats, it is crucial to deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can detect different types of attacks accurately while minimizing false alarms. Machine learning approaches have been used extensively in IDS and they are mainly using flat multi-class classification to differentiate normal traffic and different types of attacks. Though cyberattack types exhibit a hierarchical structure where similar granular attack subtypes can be grouped into more high-level attack types, hierarchical classification approach has not been explored well. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of hierarchical classification approach in IDS. We use a three-level hierarchical classification model to classify various network attacks, where the first level classifies benign or attack, the second level classifies coarse high-level attack types, and the third level classifies a granular level attack types. Our empirical results of using 10 different classification algorithms in 10 different datasets show that there is no significant difference in terms of overall classification performance (i.e., detecting normal and different types of attack correctly) of hierarchical and flat classification approaches. However, flat classification approach misclassify attacks as normal whereas hierarchical approach misclassify one type of attack as another attack type. In other words, the hierarchical classification approach significantly minimises attacks from misclassified as normal traffic, which is more important in critical systems.</description>

      <title>Impart: An Imperceptible and Effective Label-Specific Backdoor Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks have been shown to impose severe threats to real security-critical scenarios. Although previous works can achieve high attack success rates, they either require access to victim models which may significantly reduce their threats in practice, or perform visually noticeable in stealthiness. Besides, there is still room to improve the attack success rates in the scenario that different poisoned samples may have different target labels (a.k.a., the all-to-all setting). In this study, we propose a novel imperceptible backdoor attack framework, named Impart, in the scenario where the attacker has no access to the victim model. Specifically, in order to enhance the attack capability of the all-to-all setting, we first propose a label-specific attack. Different from previous works which try to find an imperceptible pattern and add it to the source image as the poisoned image, we then propose to generate perturbations that align with the target label in the image feature by a surrogate model. In this way, the generated poisoned images are attached with knowledge about the target class, which significantly enhances the attack capability.</description>

      <title>Invisible Backdoor Attack Through Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of deep learning across various domains, concerns about its security have grown significantly. Among these, backdoor attacks pose a serious security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs). In recent years, backdoor attacks on neural networks have become increasingly sophisticated, aiming to compromise the security and trustworthiness of models by implanting hidden, unauthorized functionalities or triggers, leading to misleading predictions or behaviors. To make triggers less perceptible and imperceptible, various invisible backdoor attacks have been proposed. However, most of them only consider invisibility in the spatial domain, making it easy for recent defense methods to detect the generated toxic images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes an invisible backdoor attack called DEBA. DEBA leverages the mathematical properties of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to embed imperceptible backdoors into models during the training phase, thereby causing them to exhibit predefined malicious behavior under specific trigger conditions. Specifically, we first perform SVD on images, and then replace the minor features of trigger images with those of clean images, using them as triggers to ensure the effectiveness of the attack. As minor features are scattered throughout the entire image, the major features of clean images are preserved, making poisoned images visually indistinguishable from clean ones. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DEBA is highly effective, maintaining high perceptual quality and a high attack success rate for poisoned images. Furthermore, we assess the performance of DEBA under existing defense measures, showing that it is robust and capable of significantly evading and resisting the effects of these defense measures.</description>

      <title>ASOP: A Sovereign and Secure Device Onboarding Protocol for Cloud-based IoT Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing high-friction device onboarding process hinders the promise and potentiality of Internet of Things (IoT). Even after several attempts by various device manufacturers and working groups, no widely adopted standard solution came to fruition. The latest attempt by Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance promises a zero touch solution for mass market IoT customers, but the burden is transferred to the intermediary supply chain (i.e. they have to maintain infrastructure for managing keys and digital signatures called `Ownership Voucher' for all devices). The specification relies on a `Rendezvous Server' mimicking the notion of Domain Name System (DNS) server'. This essentially means resurrecting all existing possible attack scenarios associated with DNS, which include Denial of Service (DoS) attack, and Correlation attack. `Ownership Voucher' poses the risk that some intermediary supply chain agents may act maliciously and reject the transfer of ownership or sign with a wrong key. Furthermore, the deliberate use of the weak elliptic curve SECP256r1/SECP384r1 (also known as NIST P-256/384) in the specification raises questions. We introduce ASOP: a sovereign and secure device onboarding protocol for IoT devices without blindly trusting the device manufacturer, supply chain, and cloud service provider. The ASOP protocol allows onboarding an IoT device to a cloud server with the help of an authenticator owned by the user. This paper outlines the preliminary development of the protocol and its high-level description. Our `zero-trust' and `human-in-the-loop' approach guarantees that the device owner does not remain at the mercy of third-party infrastructures, and it utilises recently standardized post-quantum cryptographic suite (CRYSTALS) to secure connection and messages.</description>

      <title>Thwarting Cybersecurity Attacks with Explainable Concept Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-security attacks pose a significant threat to the operation of autonomous systems. Particularly impacted are the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in smart buildings, which depend on data gathered by sensors and Machine Learning (ML) models using the captured data. As such, attacks that alter the readings of these sensors can severely affect the HVAC system operations impacting residents' comfort and energy reduction goals. Such attacks may induce changes in the online data distribution being fed to the ML models, violating the fundamental assumption of similarity in training and testing data distribution. This leads to a degradation in model prediction accuracy due to a phenomenon known as Concept Drift (CD) - the alteration in the relationship between input features and the target variable. Addressing CD requires identifying the source of drift to apply targeted mitigation strategies, a process termed drift explanation. This paper proposes a Feature Drift Explanation (FDE) module to identify the drifting features. FDE utilizes an Auto-encoder (AE) that reconstructs the activation of the first layer of the regression Deep Learning (DL) model and finds their latent representations. When a drift is detected, each feature of the drifting data is replaced by its representative counterpart from the training data. The Minkowski distance is then used to measure the divergence between the altered drifting data and the original training data. The results show that FDE successfully identifies 85.77 % of drifting features and showcases its utility in the DL adaptation method under the CD phenomenon. As a result, the FDE method is an effective strategy for identifying drifting features towards thwarting cyber-security attacks.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Statistical Understanding of Watermarking LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of watermarking large language models (LLMs). We consider the trade-off between model distortion and detection ability and formulate it as a constrained optimization problem based on the green-red algorithm of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023a). We show that the optimal solution to the optimization problem enjoys a nice analytical property which provides a better understanding and inspires the algorithm design for the watermarking process. We develop an online dual gradient ascent watermarking algorithm in light of this optimization formulation and prove its asymptotic Pareto optimality between model distortion and detection ability. Such a result guarantees an averaged increased green list probability and henceforth detection ability explicitly (in contrast to previous results). Moreover, we provide a systematic discussion on the choice of the model distortion metrics for the watermarking problem. We justify our choice of KL divergence and present issues with the existing criteria of ``distortion-free'' and perplexity. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms on extensive datasets against benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>RigorLLM: Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models against Undesired Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various tasks in different domains. However, the emergence of biases and the potential for generating harmful content in LLMs, particularly under malicious inputs, pose significant challenges. Current mitigation strategies, while effective, are not resilient under adversarial attacks. This paper introduces Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models (RigorLLM), a novel framework designed to efficiently and effectively moderate harmful and unsafe inputs and outputs for LLMs. By employing a multi-faceted approach that includes energy-based training data augmentation through Langevin dynamics, optimizing a safe suffix for inputs via minimax optimization, and integrating a fusion-based model combining robust KNN with LLMs based on our data augmentation, RigorLLM offers a robust solution to harmful content moderation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that RigorLLM not only outperforms existing baselines like OpenAI API and Perspective API in detecting harmful content but also exhibits unparalleled resilience to jailbreaking attacks. The innovative use of constrained optimization and a fusion-based guardrail approach represents a significant step forward in developing more secure and reliable LLMs, setting a new standard for content moderation frameworks in the face of evolving digital threats.</description>

      <title>Provable Privacy with Non-Private Pre-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When analysing Differentially Private (DP) machine learning pipelines, the potential privacy cost of data-dependent pre-processing is frequently overlooked in privacy accounting. In this work, we propose a general framework to evaluate the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private data-dependent pre-processing algorithms. Our framework establishes upper bounds on the overall privacy guarantees by utilising two new technical notions: a variant of DP termed Smooth DP and the bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing algorithms. In addition to the generic framework, we provide explicit overall privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent pre-processing algorithms, such as data imputation, quantization, deduplication and PCA, when used in combination with several DP algorithms. Notably, this framework is also simple to implement, allowing direct integration into existing DP pipelines.</description>

      <title>A Study of Vulnerability Repair in JavaScript Programs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, JavaScript has become the most widely used programming language, especially in web development. However, writing secure JavaScript code is not trivial, and programmers often make mistakes that lead to security vulnerabilities in web applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial advancements across multiple domains, and their evolving capabilities indicate their potential for automatic code generation based on a required specification, including automatic bug fixing. In this study, we explore the accuracy of LLMs, namely ChatGPT and Bard, in finding and fixing security vulnerabilities in JavaScript programs. We also investigate the impact of context in a prompt on directing LLMs to produce a correct patch of vulnerable JavaScript code. Our experiments on real-world software vulnerabilities show that while LLMs are promising in automatic program repair of JavaScript code, achieving a correct bug fix often requires an appropriate amount of context in the prompt.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Network-based Block Propagation with Optimal AoI and Reputation in Web 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web 3.0 is recognized as a pioneering paradigm that empowers users to securely oversee data without reliance on a centralized authority. Blockchains, as a core technology to realize Web 3.0, can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management. Nevertheless, the evolution of blockchain-enabled Web 3.0 is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as ensuring efficiency and reliability to enhance block propagation performance. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based reliable block propagation optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Web 3.0. We first innovatively apply a data-freshness metric called age of information to measure block propagation efficiency in public blockchains. To achieve the reliability of block propagation, we introduce a reputation mechanism based on the subjective logic model, including the local and recommended opinions to calculate the miner reputation value. Moreover, considering that the GAT possesses the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT with reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal block propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding block propagation efficiency and reliability compared with traditional routing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Private Aggregate Queries to Untrusted Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR), a privacy-preserving cryptographic tool, solves a simplified version of this problem by hiding the database item that a client accesses. Most PIR protocols require the client to know the exact row index of the intended database item, which cannot support the complicated aggregation-based statistical query in a similar setting. Some works in the PIR space contain keyword searching and SQL-like queries, but most need multiple interactions between the PIR client and PIR servers. Some schemes support searching SQL-like expressive queries in a single round but fail to enable aggregate queries. These schemes are the main focus of this paper. To bridge the gap, we have built a general-purpose novel information-theoretic PIR (IT-PIR) framework that permits a user to fetch the aggregated result, hiding all sensitive sections of the complex query from the hosting PIR server in a single round of interaction. In other words, the server will not know which records contribute to the aggregation. We then evaluate the feasibility of our protocol for both benchmarking and real-world application settings. For instance, in a complex aggregate query to the Twitter microblogging database of 1 million tweets, our protocol takes 0.014 seconds for a PIR server to generate the result when the user is interested in one of 3K user handles. In contrast, for a much-simplified task, not an aggregate but a positional query, Goldberg's regular IT-PIR (Oakland 2007) takes 1.13 seconds. For all possible user handles, 300K, it takes equal time compared to the regular IT-PIR. This example shows that complicated aggregate queries through our framework do not incur additional overhead if not less, compared to the conventional query.</description>

      <title>Mapping LLM Security Landscapes: A Comprehensive Stakeholder Risk Assessment Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse sectors has marked a transformative era, showcasing remarkable capabilities in text generation and problem-solving tasks. However, this technological advancement is accompanied by significant risks and vulnerabilities. Despite ongoing security enhancements, attackers persistently exploit these weaknesses, casting doubts on the overall trustworthiness of LLMs. Compounding the issue, organisations are deploying LLM-integrated systems without understanding the severity of potential consequences. Existing studies by OWASP and MITRE offer a general overview of threats and vulnerabilities but lack a method for directly and succinctly analysing the risks for security practitioners, developers, and key decision-makers who are working with this novel technology. To address this gap, we propose a risk assessment process using tools like the OWASP risk rating methodology which is used for traditional systems. We conduct scenario analysis to identify potential threat agents and map the dependent system components against vulnerability factors. Through this analysis, we assess the likelihood of a cyberattack. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough impact analysis to derive a comprehensive threat matrix. We also map threats against three key stakeholder groups: developers engaged in model fine-tuning, application developers utilizing third-party APIs, and end users. The proposed threat matrix provides a holistic evaluation of LLM-related risks, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for effective mitigation strategies. Our outlined process serves as an actionable and comprehensive tool for security practitioners, offering insights for resource management and enhancing the overall system security.</description>

      <title>BadEdit: Backdooring large language models by model editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mainstream backdoor attack methods typically demand substantial tuning data for poisoning, limiting their practicality and potentially degrading the overall performance when applied to Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these issues, for the first time, we formulate backdoor injection as a lightweight knowledge editing problem, and introduce the BadEdit attack framework. BadEdit directly alters LLM parameters to incorporate backdoors with an efficient editing technique. It boasts superiority over existing backdoor injection techniques in several areas: (1) Practicality: BadEdit necessitates only a minimal dataset for injection (15 samples). (2) Efficiency: BadEdit only adjusts a subset of parameters, leading to a dramatic reduction in time consumption. (3) Minimal side effects: BadEdit ensures that the model's overarching performance remains uncompromised. (4) Robustness: the backdoor remains robust even after subsequent fine-tuning or instruction-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our BadEdit framework can efficiently attack pre-trained LLMs with up to 100\% success rate while maintaining the model's performance on benign inputs.</description>

      <title>Secure Query Processing with Linear Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LINQ, the first join protocol with linear complexity (in both running time and communication) under the secure multi-party computation model (MPC). It can also be extended to support all free-connex queries, a large class of select-join-aggregate queries, still with linear complexity. This matches the plaintext result for the query processing problem, as free-connex queries are the largest class of queries known to be solvable in linear time in plaintext. We have then built a query processing system based on LINQ, and the experimental results show that LINQ significantly outperforms the state of the art. For example, it can finish a query on three relations with an output size of 1 million tuples in around 100s in the LAN setting, while existing protocols that support the query cannot finish in an hour. Thus LINQ brings MPC query processing closer to practicality.</description>

      <title>DL2Fence: Integrating Deep Learning and Frame Fusion for Enhanced Detection and Localization of Refined Denial-of-Service in Large-Scale NoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a refined Flooding Injection Rate-adjustable Denial-of-Service (DoS) model for Network-on-Chips (NoCs) and more importantly presents DL2Fence, a novel framework utilizing Deep Learning (DL) and Frame Fusion (2F) for DoS detection and localization. Two Convolutional Neural Networks models for classification and segmentation were developed to detect and localize DoS respectively. It achieves detection and localization accuracies of 95.8\% and 91.7\%, and precision rates of 98.5\% and 99.3\% in a 16x16 mesh NoC. The framework's hardware overhead notably decreases by 76.3\% when scaling from 8x8 to 16x16 NoCs, and it requires 42.4\% less hardware compared to state-of-the-arts. This advancement demonstrates DL2Fence's effectiveness in balancing outstanding detection performance in large-scale NoCs with extremely low hardware overhead.</description>

      <title>Threats, Attacks, and Defenses in Machine Unlearning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention for its potential to improve AI safety by removing the influence of specific data from trained Machine Learning (ML) models. This process, known as knowledge removal, addresses concerns about data such as sensitivity, copyright restrictions, obsolescence, or low quality. This capability is also crucial for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as the Right To Be Forgotten (RTBF). Therefore, strategic knowledge removal mitigates the risk of harmful outcomes, safeguarding against biases, misinformation, and unauthorized data exploitation, thereby enhancing the ethical use and reliability of AI systems. Efforts have been made to design efficient unlearning approaches, with MU services being examined for integration with existing machine learning as a service (MLaaS), allowing users to submit requests to erase data. However, recent research highlights vulnerabilities in machine unlearning systems, such as information leakage and malicious unlearning requests, that can lead to significant security and privacy concerns. Moreover, extensive research indicates that unlearning methods and prevalent attacks fulfill diverse roles within MU systems. For instance, unlearning can act as a mechanism to recover models from backdoor attacks, while backdoor attacks themselves can serve as an evaluation metric for unlearning effectiveness. This underscores the intricate relationship and complex interplay between these elements in maintaining system functionality and safety. Therefore, this survey seeks to bridge the gap between the extensive number of studies on threats, attacks, and defenses in machine unlearning and the absence of a comprehensive review that categorizes their taxonomy, methods, and solutions, thus offering valuable insights for future research directions and practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Statistical Confidence in Mining Power Estimates for PoW Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems depends on the distribution of mining power across participants. If sufficient mining power is controlled by one entity, they can force their own version of events. This may allow them to double spend coins, for example. For Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, however, the distribution of mining power cannot be read directly from the blockchain and must instead be inferred from the number of blocks mined in a specific sample window. We introduce a framework to quantify this statistical uncertainty for the Nakamoto coefficient, which is a commonly-used measure of blockchain decentralization. We show that aggregating blocks over a day can lead to considerable uncertainty, with Bitcoin failing more than half the hypothesis tests ({\alpha} = 0.05) when using a daily granularity. For these reasons, we recommend that blocks are aggregated over a sample window of at least 7 days. Instead of reporting a single value, our approach produces a range of possible Nakamoto coefficient values that have statistical support at a particular significance level {\alpha}.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Secure Certificate-Less Conditional Privacy-Preserving Authentication for VANET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) marked a pronounced change in the Intelligent Transport System and Smart Cities through seamless vehicle communication to intensify safety and efficacy. However, a few authentication schemes have been devised in the literature to ensure the authenticity of the source and information in the post-quantum era. The most popular base for such construction is lattice-based cryptography. However, existing lattice-based authentication schemes fall short of addressing the potential challenges of the leakage of the master secret key and key-escrow problem. By ingeniously addressing both issues, the paper proposes the \emph{first} quantum secure authentication scheme to eliminate the flaws while maintaining the system's overall efficiency intact. Compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the provable security and overall performance assessment highlight the suitability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Duwak: Dual Watermarks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLM) are increasingly used for text generation tasks, it is critical to audit their usages, govern their applications, and mitigate their potential harms. Existing watermark techniques are shown effective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable patterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics. However, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of tokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against post-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity. We theoretically explain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate Duwak extensively on Llama2 under various post-editing attacks, against four state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them. Our results show that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at the lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than existing approaches, especially under post paraphrasing.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Partial Sharing on the Resilience of Online Federated Learning Against Model Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the resilience of the partial-sharing online federated learning (PSO-Fed) algorithm against model-poisoning attacks. PSO-Fed reduces the communication load by enabling clients to exchange only a fraction of their model estimates with the server at each update round. Partial sharing of model estimates also enhances the robustness of the algorithm against model-poisoning attacks. To gain better insights into this phenomenon, we analyze the performance of the PSO-Fed algorithm in the presence of Byzantine clients, malicious actors who may subtly tamper with their local models by adding noise before sharing them with the server. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that PSO-Fed maintains convergence in both mean and mean-square senses, even under the strain of model-poisoning attacks. We further derive the theoretical mean square error (MSE) of PSO-Fed, linking it to various parameters such as stepsize, attack probability, number of Byzantine clients, client participation rate, partial-sharing ratio, and noise variance. We also show that there is a non-trivial optimal stepsize for PSO-Fed when faced with model-poisoning attacks. The results of our extensive numerical experiments affirm our theoretical assertions and highlight the superior ability of PSO-Fed to counteract Byzantine attacks, outperforming other related leading algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This paper uses Euclidean Information Theory (EIT) to analyze the wiretap channel. We investigate a scenario of efficiently transmitting a small amount of information subject to compression rate and secrecy constraints. We transform the information-theoretic problem into a linear algebra problem and obtain the perturbed probability distributions such that secrecy is achievable. Local approximations are being used in order to obtain an estimate of the secrecy capacity by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-resilient Federated Learning With Adaptivity to Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with federated learning (FL) in the presence of malicious Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity. A novel Robust Average Gradient Algorithm (RAGA) is proposed, which leverages the geometric median for aggregation and can freely select the round number for local updating. Different from most existing resilient approaches, which perform convergence analysis based on strongly-convex loss function or homogeneously distributed dataset, we conduct convergence analysis for not only strongly-convex but also non-convex loss function over heterogeneous dataset. According to our theoretical analysis, as long as the fraction of dataset from malicious users is less than half, RAGA can achieve convergence at rate $\mathcal{O}({1}/{T^{2/3- \delta}})$ where $T$ is the iteration number and $\delta \in (0, 2/3)$ for non-convex loss function, and at linear rate for strongly-convex loss function. Moreover, stationary point or global optimal solution is proved to obtainable as data heterogeneity vanishes. Experimental results corroborate the robustness of RAGA to Byzantine attacks and verifies the advantage of RAGA over baselines on convergence performance under various intensity of Byzantine attacks, for heterogeneous dataset.</description>

Abstract: Integrating machine learning into Automated Control Systems (ACS) enhances decision-making in industrial process management. One of the limitations to the widespread adoption of these technologies in industry is the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. This study explores the threats in deploying deep learning models for fault diagnosis in ACS using the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. By evaluating three neural networks with different architectures, we subject them to six types of adversarial attacks and explore five different defense methods. Our results highlight the strong vulnerability of models to adversarial samples and the varying effectiveness of defense strategies. We also propose a novel protection approach by combining multiple defense methods and demonstrate it's efficacy. This research contributes several insights into securing machine learning within ACS, ensuring robust fault diagnosis in industrial processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented availability of training data fueled the rapid development of powerful neural networks in recent years. However, the need for such large amounts of data leads to potential threats such as poisoning attacks: adversarial manipulations of the training data aimed at compromising the learned model to achieve a given adversarial goal.
  This paper investigates defenses against clean-label poisoning attacks and proposes a novel approach to detect and filter poisoned datapoints in the transfer learning setting. We define a new characteristic vector representation of datapoints and show that it effectively captures the intrinsic properties of the data distribution. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that effective poisons can be successfully differentiated from clean points in the characteristic vector space. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach and compare it to existing state-of-the-art defenses using multiple architectures, datasets, and poison budgets. Our evaluation shows that our proposal outperforms existing approaches in defense rate and final trained model performance across all experimental settings.</description>

Abstract: Several websites improve their security and avoid dangerous Internet attacks by implementing CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), a type of verification to identify whether the end-user is human or a robot. The most prevalent type of CAPTCHA is text-based, designed to be easily recognized by humans while being unsolvable towards machines or robots. However, as deep learning technology progresses, development of convolutional neural network (CNN) models that predict text-based CAPTCHAs becomes easier. The purpose of this research is to investigate the flaws and vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA generating systems in order to design more resilient CAPTCHAs. To achieve this, we created CapNet, a Convolutional Neural Network. The proposed platform can evaluate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs</description>

      <title>Contingency Analyses with Warm Starter using Probabilistic Graphical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyberthreats are an increasingly common risk to the power grid and can thwart secure grid operations. We propose to extend contingency analysis to include cyberthreat evaluations. However, unlike the traditional N-1 or N-2 contingencies, cyberthreats (e.g., MadIoT) require simulating hard-to-solve N-k (with k &gt;&gt; 2) contingencies in a practical amount of time. Purely physics-based power flow solvers, while being accurate, are slow and may not solve N-k contingencies in a timely manner, whereas the emerging data-driven alternatives are fast but not sufficiently generalizable, interpretable, and scalable. To address these challenges, we propose a novel conditional Gaussian Random Field-based data-driven method that performs fast and accurate evaluation of cyberthreats. It achieves speedup of contingency analysis by warm-starting simulations, i.e., improving starting points, for the physical solvers. To improve the physical interpretability and generalizability, the proposed method incorporates domain knowledge by considering the graphical nature of the grid topology. To improve scalability, the method applies physics-informed regularization that reduces model complexity. Experiments validate that simulating MadIoT-induced attacks with our warm starter becomes approximately 5x faster on a realistic 2000-bus system.</description>

      <title>LogPr\'ecis: Unleashing Language Models for Automated Shell Log Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collection of security-related logs holds the key to understanding attack behaviors and diagnosing vulnerabilities. Still, their analysis remains a daunting challenge. Recently, Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated unmatched potential in understanding natural and programming languages. The question arises whether and how LMs could be also useful for security experts since their logs contain intrinsically confused and obfuscated information. In this paper, we systematically study how to benefit from the state-of-the-art in LM to automatically analyze text-like Unix shell attack logs. We present a thorough design methodology that leads to LogPr\'ecis. It receives as input raw shell sessions and automatically identifies and assigns the attacker tactic to each portion of the session, i.e., unveiling the sequence of the attacker's goals. We demonstrate LogPr\'ecis capability to support the analysis of two large datasets containing about 400,000 unique Unix shell attacks. LogPr\'ecis reduces them into about 3,000 fingerprints, each grouping sessions with the same sequence of tactics. The abstraction it provides lets the analyst better understand attacks, identify fingerprints, detect novelty, link similar attacks, and track families and mutations. Overall, LogPr\'ecis, released as open source, paves the way for better and more responsive defense against cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Adversarial Node Placement in Decentralized Federated Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Federated Learning (FL) grows in popularity, new decentralized frameworks are becoming widespread. These frameworks leverage the benefits of decentralized environments to enable fast and energy-efficient inter-device communication. However, this growing popularity also intensifies the need for robust security measures. While existing research has explored various aspects of FL security, the role of adversarial node placement in decentralized networks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the performance of decentralized FL for various adversarial placement strategies when adversaries can jointly coordinate their placement within a network. We establish two baseline strategies for placing adversarial node: random placement and network centrality-based placement. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel attack algorithm that prioritizes adversarial spread over adversarial centrality by maximizing the average network distance between adversaries. We show that the new attack algorithm significantly impacts key performance metrics such as testing accuracy, outperforming the baseline frameworks by between $9\%$ and $66.5\%$ for the considered setups. Our findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of decentralized FL systems, setting the stage for future research aimed at developing more secure and robust decentralized FL frameworks.</description>

Abstract: Designing secure information infrastructure is a function of design and usability. However, security is seldom given priority when systems are being developed. Secure design practices should balance between functionality (i.e., proper design) to meet minimum requirements and user-friendliness. Design recommendations such as those with a user-centric approach (i.e., inclusive of only relevant information, user liberty) and presenting information within its proper context in a clear and engaging manner has been scientifically shown to improve user response and experience.</description>

      <title>On the Privacy Effect of Data Enhancement via the Lens of Memorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning poses severe privacy concerns as it has been shown that the learned models can reveal sensitive information about their training data. Many works have investigated the effect of widely adopted data augmentation and adversarial training techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the privacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often measured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem, we deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization degrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil several findings about the connections between three essential properties of machine learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that the generalization gap and privacy leakage are less correlated than those of the previous results. Moreover, there is not necessarily a trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy as stronger adversarial robustness does not make the model more susceptible to privacy attacks.</description>

      <title>BAFFLE: Hiding Backdoors in Offline Reinforcement Learning Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04688v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) makes an agent learn from trial-and-error experiences gathered during the interaction with the environment. Recently, offline RL has become a popular RL paradigm because it saves the interactions with environments. In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected datasets, and others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the environments. This paradigm has demonstrated effectiveness in critical tasks like robot control, autonomous driving, etc. However, less attention is paid to investigating the security threats to the offline RL system. This paper focuses on backdoor attacks, where some perturbations are added to the data (observations) such that given normal observations, the agent takes high-rewards actions, and low-reward actions on observations injected with triggers. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline Reinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to RL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different offline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four tasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the existing offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. More specifically, Baffle modifies 10\% of the datasets for four tasks (3 robotic controls and 1 autonomous driving). Agents trained on the poisoned datasets perform well in normal settings. However, when triggers are presented, the agents' performance decreases drastically by 63.2\%, 53.9\%, 64.7\%, and 47.4\% in the four tasks on average. The backdoor still persists after fine-tuning poisoned agents on clean datasets. We further show that the inserted backdoor is also hard to be detected by a popular defensive method. This paper calls attention to developing more effective protection for the open-source offline RL dataset.</description>

      <title>Federated Foundation Models: Privacy-Preserving and Collaborative Learning for Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs), such as LLaMA, BERT, GPT, ViT, and CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications, driven by their ability to leverage vast amounts of data for pre-training. However, optimizing FMs often requires access to sensitive data, raising privacy concerns and limiting their applicability in many domains. In this paper, we propose the Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) paradigm, which combines the benefits of FMs and Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving and collaborative learning across multiple end-users. We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of integrating FL into the lifespan of FMs, covering pre-training, fine-tuning, and application. We further outline potential future research avenues in FFM, including FFM pre-training, FFM fine-tuning, and federated prompt tuning, which allow the development of more personalized and context-aware models while ensuring data privacy. Moreover, we explore the possibility of continual/lifelong learning in FFMs, as increased computational power at the edge may unlock the potential for optimizing FMs using newly generated private data close to the data source. The proposed FFM concepts offer a flexible and scalable framework for training large language models in a privacy-preserving manner, setting the stage for subsequent advancements in both FM training and federated learning.</description>

      <title>$GRU^{spa}$: Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</description>

      <title>Advancing Beyond Identification: Multi-bit Watermark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the viability of tackling misuses of large language models beyond the identification of machine-generated text. While existing zero-bit watermark methods focus on detection only, some malicious misuses demand tracing the adversary user for counteracting them. To address this, we propose Multi-bit Watermark via Position Allocation, embedding traceable multi-bit information during language model generation. Through allocating tokens onto different parts of the messages, we embed longer messages in high corruption settings without added latency. By independently embedding sub-units of messages, the proposed method outperforms the existing works in terms of robustness and latency. Leveraging the benefits of zero-bit watermarking, our method enables robust extraction of the watermark without any model access, embedding and extraction of long messages ($\geq$ 32-bit) without finetuning, and maintaining text quality, while allowing zero-bit detection all at the same time. Code is released here: https://github.com/bangawayoo/mb-lm-watermarking</description>

      <title>Exploring the Privacy-Energy Consumption Tradeoff for Split Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) has recently emerged as a promising distributed learning technology, leveraging the strengths of both federated and split learning. It emphasizes the advantages of rapid convergence while addressing privacy concerns. As a result, this innovation has received significant attention from both industry and academia. However, since the model is split at a specific layer, known as a cut layer, into both client-side and server-side models for the SFL, the choice of the cut layer in SFL can have a substantial impact on the energy consumption of clients and their privacy, as it influences the training burden and the output of the client-side models. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the SFL process and thoroughly analyze energy consumption and privacy. This analysis considers the influence of various system parameters on the cut layer selection strategy. Additionally, we provide an illustrative example of the cut layer selection, aiming to minimize clients' risk of reconstructing the raw data at the server while sustaining energy consumption within the required energy budget, which involves trade-offs. Finally, we address open challenges in this field. These directions represent promising avenues for future research and development.</description>
