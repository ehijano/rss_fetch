      <title>Shifts of dominant personality and spatial pattern formation due to spatially heterogeneous pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personality traits, such as boldness and shyness, play a significant role in shaping the survival strategies of animals. Industrial pollution has long posed serious threats to ecosystems and is typically distributed heterogeneously. However, how animals with different personalities respond to spatially heterogeneous pollution remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce a prey-taxis model with nonlinear cross-diffusion to examine population dynamics in such environments. The global existence of classical solutions is established by deriving initial bounds through energy estimates and improving solution regularity via heat kernel properties and a bootstrap process. Our findings reveal that behavior, population structure, and spatial distribution are heavily influenced by pollution. Bold individuals maintain a competitive advantage in pollution-free or very low-toxin environments, whereas shy individuals become dominant in regions with low to moderate toxin levels. In highly polluted areas, no populations can survive. The spatial pattern of the population is also closely tied to the distribution of toxins. Grazers tend to move along toxin gradient and exhibit periodic behavior. As toxin concentrations rise, aggregation behavior becomes increasingly pronounced across all species. Interestingly, the total population in polluted areas may initially increase when toxin levels are low to moderate, but eventually declines, leading to extinction as toxin levels continue to rise.</description>

      <title>Predicting high dengue incidence in municipalities of Brazil using path signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting whether to expect a high incidence of infectious diseases is critical for health surveillance. In the epidemiology of dengue, environmental conditions can significantly impact the transmission of the virus. Utilizing epidemiological indicators alongside environmental variables can enhance predictions of dengue incidence risk. This study analyzed a dataset of weekly case numbers, temperature, and humidity across Brazilian municipalities to forecast the risk of high dengue incidence using data from 2014 to 2023. The framework involved constructing path signatures and applying lasso regression for binary outcomes. Sensitivity reached 75%, while specificity was extremely high, ranging from 75% to 100%. The best performance was observed with information gathered after 35 weeks of observations using data augmentation via embedding techniques. The use of path signatures effectively captures the stream of information given by epidemiological and climate variables that influence dengue transmission. This framework could be instrumental in optimizing resources to predict high dengue risk in municipalities in Brazil and other countries after learning these country patterns.</description>

      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>
