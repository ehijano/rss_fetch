      <title>Support Recovery in One-bit Compressed Sensing with Near-Optimal Measurements and Sublinear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $\Omega(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1.i): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. (1.ii): For the universal $\epsilon$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(k\epsilon^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(\epsilon^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization for IRS-Aided SWIPT with Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has been envisioned as a promising technology to support ubiquitous connectivity and reliable sustainability in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, which, however, generally suffers from severe attenuation caused by long distance propagation, leading to inefficient wireless power transfer (WPT) for energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). This paper proposes to introduce emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies into SWIPT systems aiming at enhancing information transmission for information decoding receivers (IDRs) and improving receive power of EHRs. We consider to maximize the weighted sum-rate of IDRs via jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming at the base station (BS) and IRS, respectively, as well as the positions of MAs, while guaranteeing the requirements of all EHRs. To tackle this challenging task due to the non-convexity of associated optimization, we develop an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimal mean square error (WMMSE), block coordinate descent (BCD), majorization-minimization (MM), and penalty duality decomposition (PDD) frameworks. Besides, we present a feasibility characterization method to examine the achievability of EHRs' requirements. Simulation results demonstrate the significant benefits of our proposed solutions. Particularly, the optimized IRS configuration may exhibit higher performance gain than MA counterpart under our considered scenario.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling in Continuous Aperture Arrays: Physical Modeling and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of mutual coupling in continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs) is studied. First, a general physical model for the phenomenon that accounts for both polarization and surface dissipation losses is developed. Then, the unipolarized coupling kernel is characterized, revealing that polarization induces anisotropic coupling and invalidates the conventional half-wavelength spacing rule for coupling elimination. Next, the beamforming design problem for CAPAs with coupling is formulated as a functional optimization problem, leading to the derivation of optimal beamforming structures via the calculus of variations. To address the challenge of inverting the coupling kernel in the optimal structure, two methods are proposed: 1) the kernel approximation method, which yields a closed-form solution via wavenumber-domain transformation and GaussLegendre quadrature, and 2) the conjugate gradient method, which addresses an equivalent quadratic functional optimization problem iteratively. Furthermore, the optimal array gain and beampattern are analyzed at the large-aperture limit. Finally, the proposed continuous mutual coupling model is extended to spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), and comprehensive numerical results are provided, demonstrating that: 1) coupled SPDA performance correctly converges to the CAPA limit, while uncoupled models are shown to violate physics, 2) polarization results in anisotropic array gain behavior, and 3) the coupled beampattern exhibits higher directivity than the uncoupled beampattern.</description>

      <title>SCL Decoding of Non-Binary Linear Block Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-binary linear block codes (NB-LBCs) are an important class of error-correcting codes that are especially competent in correcting burst errors. They have broad applications in modern communications and storage systems. However, efficient soft-decision decoding of these codes remains challenging. This paper proposes successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding for NB-LBCs that are defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^r}, where r is the extension degree. By establishing a one-to-r mapping between the binary composition of each non-binary codeword and r binary polar codewords, SCL decoding of the r polar codes can be performed with a complexity that is sub-quadratic in the codeword length. An r-step decoding path sorting strategy is further proposed to facilitate the decoding. Simulation results on extended Reed-Solomon (eRS) and non-binary extended BCH (NB-eBCH) codes show that SCL decoding can outperform their state-of-the-art soft-decision decoding with fewer finite field arithmetic operations. For length-16 eRS codes, their maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performances can be approached with a moderate list size.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization for Multi-User Transmissive RIS-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) represent a transformative architecture for future wireless networks, enabling a paradigm shift from traditional costly base stations to low-cost, energy-efficient transmitters. This paper explores a downlink multi-user MIMO system where a transmissive RIS, illuminated by a single feed antenna, forms the core of the transmitter. The joint optimization of the RIS coefficient vector, power allocation, and receive beamforming in such a system is critical for performance but poses significant challenges due to the non-convex objective, coupled variables, and constant modulus constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel optimization framework. Our approach involves reformulating the sum-rate maximization problem into a tractable equivalent form and developing an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the problem into subproblems for the RIS coefficients, receive beamformers, and power allocation, each solved using advanced techniques including convex approximation and difference-of-convex programming. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method converges rapidly and achieves substantial sum-rate gains over conventional schemes, validating the effectiveness of our approach and highlighting the potential of transmissive RIS as a key technology for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Beamspace Equalization for mmWave Massive MIMO: Algorithms and VLSI Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Steering for Lossless Text Compression via Weighted Product of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.</description>

      <title>Privacy protection under the exposure of systems' prior information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For systems whose states implicate sensitive information, their privacy is of great concern. While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.</description>

      <title>Query complexities of quantum channel discrimination and estimation: A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Structural asymmetry as a fraud signature: detecting collusion with Heron's Information Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fraud in public procurement remains a persistent challenge, especially in large, decentralized systems like Brazil's Unified Health System. We introduce Heron's Information Coefficient (HIC), a geometric measure that quantifies how subgraphs deviate from the global structure of a network. Applied to over eight years of Brazilian bidding data for medical supplies, this measure highlights collusive patterns that standard indicators may overlook. Unlike conventional robustness metrics, the Heron coefficient focuses on the interaction between active and inactive subgraphs, revealing structural shifts that may signal coordinated behavior, such as cartel formation. Synthetic experiments support these findings, demonstrating strong detection performance across varying corruption intensities and network sizes. While our results do not replace legal or economic analyses, they offer an effective complementary tool for auditors and policymakers to monitor procurement integrity more effectively. This study demonstrates that simple geometric insight can reveal hidden dynamics in real-world networks better than other Information Theoretic metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel partitioning scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that simultaneously consider RIS identification and beamforming. The proposed scheme dynamicly and efficiently allocates RIS elements between identification and beamforming users, considering the different performance metrics associated with each of them. By employing a dynamic partitioning algorithm that efficiently manage the RIS resources (elements), the scheme significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while maintaining reliable identification performance. Finally, theoretical analysis and computer simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Incentive Attacks in BTC: Short-Term Revenue Changes and Long-Term Efficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bitcoin's (BTC) Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has been a source of vulnerability for incentive attacks such as selfish mining, block withholding and coin hopping strategies. In this paper, first, we rigorously study the short-term revenue change per hashpower of the adversarial and honest miners for these incentive attacks. To study the long-term effects, we introduce a new efficiency metric defined as the revenue/cost per hashpower per time for the attacker and the honest miners.
  Our results indicate that the short-term benefits of intermittent mining strategies are negligible compared to the original selfish mining attack, and in the long-term, selfish mining provides better efficiency. We further demonstrate that a coin hopping strategy between BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) relying on BTC DAA benefits the loyal honest miners of BTC in the same way and to the same extent per unit of computational power as it does the hopper in the short-term. For the long-term, we establish a new boundary between the selfish mining and coin hopping attack, identifying the optimal efficient strategy for each parameter.
  For block withholding strategies, it turns out, the honest miners outside the pool profit from the attack, usually even more than the attacker both in the short-term and the long-term. Moreover, a power adjusting withholding attacker does not necessarily observe a profit lag in the short-term. It has been long thought that the profit lag of selfish mining is among the main reasons why such an attack has not been observed in practice. We show that such a barrier does not apply to power adjusting attacks and relatively small pools are at an immediate threat.</description>

      <title>HetDAPAC: Leveraging Attribute Heterogeneity in Distributed Attribute-Based Private Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Codebook based Multiuser Beam Training for Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, multiuser beam training based on hierarchical codebook for millimeter wave massive multi-input multi-output is investigated, where the base station (BS) simultaneously performs beam training with multiple user equipments (UEs). For the UEs, an alternative minimization method with a closed-form expression (AMCF) is proposed to design the hierarchical codebook under the constant modulus constraint. To speed up the convergence of the AMCF, an initialization method based on Zadoff-Chu sequence is proposed. For the BS, a simultaneous multiuser beam training scheme based on an adaptively designed hierarchical codebook is proposed, where the codewords in the current layer of the codebook are designed according to the beam training results of the previous layer. The codewords at the BS are designed with multiple mainlobes, each covering a spatial region for one or more UEs. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical codebook design schemes and show that the proposed multiuser beam training scheme can approach the performance of the beam sweeping but with significantly reduced beam training overhead.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Analysis for MISO Broadcast Systems with Regularized Zero-Forcing Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an effective way to enhance the physical layer security (PLS) for the broadcast channel (BC), regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding has attracted much attention. However, the reliability performance, i.e., secrecy outage probability (SOP), of RZF is not well investigated in the literature. In this paper, we characterize the secrecy performance of RZF precoding in the large multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast system. For this purpose, we first consider a central limit theorem (CLT) for the joint distribution of the users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the eavesdropper's (Eve's) signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR) by leveraging random matrix theory (RMT). The result is then utilized to obtain a closed-form approximation for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and SOP of three typical scenarios: the case with only external Eves, the case with only internal Eves, and that with both. The derived results are then used to evaluate the percentage of users in secrecy outage and the required number of transmit antennas to achieve a positive secrecy rate. It is shown that, with equally-capable Eves, the secrecy loss caused by external Eves is higher than that caused by internal Eves. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling in the Finite Time-Bandwidth Product Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling within a consistent framework based on a fixed time-bandwidth product (TBP), resolving potential ambiguities present in finite blocklength analysis. A key feature of FTN is its ability to increase the number of transmitted symbols in a given time and frequency resource, which can lower the rate penalties inherent in short packet communications. We derive tight bounds on the maximum channel coding rate (MCCR) and demonstrate that FTN's rate gains over Nyquist signaling can be higher in the finite TBP regime than in the asymptotic case. Performance is benchmarked against the theoretical optimum of transmitting prolate spheroidal wave functions, showing that a well-designed FTN system can closely approach this limit. We present practical design criteria, including the optimal time-acceleration factor for maximizing signaling dimensions, an optimized pulse shape that meets strict out-of-band constraints, and a turbo-equalization-based coding scheme that performs near the derived MCCR bounds. These findings establish FTN as a practical and near-optimal technique for enhancing the rate and reliability of latency-constrained communications.</description>

      <title>Cache-Aided MIMO Communications: DoF Analysis and Transmitter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we analyze both the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) under linear processing constraint and the finite-SNR performance of a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We first demonstrate that the enhanced DoF of \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \times \beta\) is achievable with linear processing, where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{\big(1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Then, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while still adhering to linear processing constraints. This new class of schemes is paired with an efficient linear multicast beamformer design, resulting in a more practical, high-performance solution for integrating CC in future MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Random Access: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple access communication systems enable numerous users to share common communication resources, playing a crucial role in wireless networks. With the emergence of the sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication networks, supporting massive machine-type communications with sporadic activity patterns is expected to become a critical challenge. Unsourced random access (URA) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address this challenge by decoupling user identification from data transmission through the use of a common codebook. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of URA solutions, encompassing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. We present a systematic classification of URA solutions across three primary channel models: Gaussian multiple access channels (GMACs), single-antenna fading channels, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. For each category, we analyze and compare state-of-the-art solutions in terms of performance, complexity, and practical feasibility. Additionally, we discuss critical challenges such as interference management, computational complexity, and synchronization. The survey concludes with promising future research directions and potential methods to address existing limitations, providing a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to lattices constructed based on polar-like codes and demonstrate some of their key properties, such as AWGN goodness. We first present polar lattices directly from the perspective of their generator matrix. Next, we discuss their connection with the recently proposed PAC (polarization adjusted convolutional) lattices and analyze the structural advantages of PAC lattices, through which the AWGN-goodness of PAC lattices can be conveniently demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Strong Duality in Risk-Constrained Nonconvex Functional Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a wide class of risk-constrained nonconvex functional optimization problems exhibit strong duality, regardless of nonconvexity. We develop two novel results under distinct sets of assumptions, establishing strong duality over both decomposable policy spaces (matching and extending prior work in the risk neutral case), and nondecomposable policy spaces with structure (e.g., continuity or smoothness), including certain universal finite-dimensional (fixed depth/width) neural network parametrizations as special cases (improving established results in the risk-neutral setting as well). We consider constraints featuring convex and positively homogeneous risk measures with bounded risk envelopes, generalizing expectations. Popular risk measures supported within our setting include the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the (even non-monotone) mean-absolute deviation (MAD), certain distributionally robust representations and more generally all real-valued coherent risk measures on the space $L_1$. We further discuss various generalizations of our base model, extensions for risk measures supported on $L_{p&gt;1}$, implications in the context of mean-risk tradeoff models, as well as applications in wireless systems resource allocation, and supervised constrained learning. Our core proof technique appears to be new and relies on risk conjugate duality in tandem with J. J. Uhl's weak extension of A. A. Lyapunov's convexity theorem for vector measures taking values in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Reliable AI Through Neuromorphic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) research today is largely driven by ever-larger neural network models trained on graphics processing units (GPUs). This paradigm has yielded remarkable progress, but it also risks entrenching a hardware lottery in which algorithmic choices succeed primarily because they align with current hardware, rather than because they are inherently superior. In particular, the dominance of Transformer architectures running on GPU clusters has led to an arms race of scaling up models, resulting in exorbitant computational costs and energy usage. At the same time, today's AI models often remain unreliable in the sense that they cannot properly quantify uncertainty in their decisions -- for example, large language models tend to hallucinate incorrect outputs with high confidence.
  This article argues that achieving more efficient and reliable AI will require embracing a set of principles that are well-aligned with the goals of neuromorphic engineering, which are in turn inspired by how the brain processes information. Specifically, we outline six key neuromorphic principles, spanning algorithms, architectures, and hardware, that can inform the design of future AI systems: (i) the use of stateful, recurrent models; (ii) extreme dynamic sparsity, possibly down to spike-based processing; (iii) backpropagation-free on-device learning and fine-tuning; (iv) probabilistic decision-making; (v) in-memory computing; and (vi) hardware-software co-design via stochastic computing. We discuss each of these principles in turn, surveying relevant prior work and pointing to directions for research.</description>

      <title>A Simple Detection and Identification Scheme For Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communication is one of the promising physical layer enabling technologies for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks due to their unprecedented capabilities in shaping the wireless communication environment. RISs are modeled as passive objects that can not transmit or receive wireless signals. While the passiveness of these surfaces is a key advantage in terms of power consumption and implementation complexity, it limits their capability to interact with the other active components in the network. Specifically, unlike conventional base stations (BSs), which actively identify themselves to user equipment (UEs) by periodically sending pilot signals, RISs need to be detected from the UE side. This paper proposes a novel RIS identification (RIS- ID) scheme, enabling UEs to detect and uniquely identify RISs in their surrounding environment. Furthermore, to assess the proposed RIS-ID scheme, we propose two performance metrics: the false and miss detection probabilities. These probabilities are analytically derived and verified through computer simulations, revealing the effectiveness of the proposed RIS-ID scheme under different operating scenarios.</description>

      <title>Partial Information Decomposition for Data Interpretability and Feature Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Partial Information Decomposition of Features (PIDF), a new paradigm for simultaneous data interpretability and feature selection. Contrary to traditional methods that assign a single importance value, our approach is based on three metrics per feature: the mutual information shared with the target variable, the feature's contribution to synergistic information, and the amount of this information that is redundant. In particular, we develop a novel procedure based on these three metrics, which reveals not only how features are correlated with the target but also the additional and overlapping information provided by considering them in combination with other features. We extensively evaluate PIDF using both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its potential applications and effectiveness, by considering case studies from genetics and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Towards Formalizing Spuriousness of Biased Datasets Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spuriousness arises when there is an association between two or more variables in a dataset that are not causally related. In this work, we propose an explainability framework to preemptively disentangle the nature of such spurious associations in a dataset before model training. We leverage a body of work in information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to decompose the total information about the target into four non-negative quantities, namely unique information (in core and spurious features, respectively), redundant information, and synergistic information. Our framework helps anticipate when the core or spurious feature is indispensable, when either suffices, and when both are jointly needed for an optimal classifier trained on the dataset. Next, we leverage this decomposition to propose a novel measure of the spuriousness of a dataset. We arrive at this measure systematically by examining several candidate measures, and demonstrating what they capture and miss through intuitive canonical examples and counterexamples. Our framework Spurious Disentangler consists of segmentation, dimensionality reduction, and estimation modules, with capabilities to specifically handle high-dimensional image data efficiently. Finally, we also perform empirical evaluation to demonstrate the trends of unique, redundant, and synergistic information, as well as our proposed spuriousness measure across $6$ benchmark datasets under various experimental settings. We observe an agreement between our preemptive measure of dataset spuriousness and post-training model generalization metrics such as worst-group accuracy, further supporting our proposition. The code is available at https://github.com/Barproda/spuriousness-disentangler.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>
