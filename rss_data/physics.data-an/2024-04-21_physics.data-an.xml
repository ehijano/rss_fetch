      <title>Comparison of Two-Moment and Three-Moment Bulk Microphysics Schemes in Thunderstorm Simulations over Indian Subcontinent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed three-dimensional thunderstorm real simulations using the two-moment and three-moment bulk microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. We have analyzed three cases to understand the potential differences between the double-moment (Morrison-2M) and National Taiwan University triple-moment (NTU-3M) microphysics parameterizations in capturing the characteristics of lightning events over the Indian subcontinent. Despite general resemblances in these schemes, the simulations reveal distinct differences in storm structure, cloud hydrometeors formation, and precipitation. The lightning flash counts from the in situ lightning detection network (LDN) are also used to compare the simulation of storms. The Lightning Potential Index (LPI) is computed for Morrison-2M and NTU-3M microphysics schemes and compared it with the Lightning Detection Network (LDN) observation. In most cases, the Morrison-2M shows more LPI than the NTU-3M scheme. Both the schemes also differ in simulating rainfall and other thermodynamical, dynamical, and microphysical parameters in the model. Here, we have attempted to identify the basic differences between these two schemes, which may be responsible for the discrepancies in the simulations. In particular, the Morrison-2M produced much higher surface precipitation rates. The effects on the size distributions cloud hydrometeors between two microphysical schemes are important to simulate the biases in the precipitation and lightning flash counts. The inclusions of ice crystal shapes are responsible for many of the key differences between the two microphysics simulations. Different approaches in treating cloud ice, snow, and graupel may have an impact on the simulation of lightning and precipitation. Results show that the simulation of lightning events is sensitive to microphysical parameterization schemes in NWP models.</description>

      <title>A Fast Maximum Clique Algorithm Based on Network Decomposition for Large Sparse Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding maximum cliques in large networks is a challenging combinatorial problem with many real-world applications. We present a fast algorithm to achieve the exact solution for the maximum clique problem in large sparse networks based on efficient graph decomposition. A bunch of effective techniques is being used to greatly prune the graph and a novel concept called Complete-Upper-Bound-Induced Subgraph (CUBIS) is proposed to ensure that the structures with the potential to form the maximum clique are retained in the process of graph decomposition. Our algorithm first pre-prunes peripheral nodes, subsequently, one or two small-scale CUBISs are constructed guided by the core number and current maximum clique size. Bron-Kerbosch search is performed on each CUBIS to find the maximum clique. Experiments on 50 empirical networks with a scale of up to 20 million show the CUBIS scales are largely independent of the original network scale. This enables an approximately linear runtime, making our algorithm amenable for large networks. Our work provides a new framework for effectively solving maximum clique problems on massive sparse graphs, which not only makes the graph scale no longer the bottleneck but also shows some light on solving other clique-related problems.</description>
