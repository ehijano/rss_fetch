      <title>SPP-SCL: Semi-Push-Pull Supervised Contrastive Learning for Image-Text Sentiment Analysis and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Image-Text Sentiment Analysis (ITSA) methods may suffer from inconsistent intra-modal and inter-modal sentiment relationships. Therefore, we develop a method that balances before fusing to solve the issue of vision-language imbalance intra-modal and inter-modal sentiment relationships; that is, a Semi-Push-Pull Supervised Contrastive Learning (SPP-SCL) method is proposed. Specifically, the method is implemented using a novel two-step strategy, namely first using the proposed intra-modal supervised contrastive learning to pull the relationships between the intra-modal and then performing a well-designed conditional execution statement. If the statement result is false, our method will perform the second step, which is inter-modal supervised contrastive learning to push away the relationships between inter-modal. The two-step strategy will balance the intra-modal and inter-modal relationships to achieve the purpose of relationship consistency and finally perform cross-modal feature fusion for sentiment analysis and detection. Experimental studies on three public image-text sentiment and sarcasm detection datasets demonstrate that SPP-SCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin and is more discriminative in sentiment.</description>

      <title>Not Just What's There: Enabling CLIP to Comprehend Negated Visual Descriptions Without Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP struggle to understand negation, often embedding affirmatives and negatives similarly (e.g., matching "no dog" with dog images). Existing methods refine negation understanding via fine-tuning CLIP's text encoder, risking overfitting. In this work, we propose CLIPGlasses, a plug-and-play framework that enhances CLIP's ability to comprehend negated visual descriptions. CLIPGlasses adopts a dual-stage design: a Lens module disentangles negated semantics from text embeddings, and a Frame module predicts context-aware repulsion strength, which is integrated into a modified similarity computation to penalize alignment with negated semantics, thereby reducing false positive matches. Experiments show that CLIP equipped with CLIPGlasses achieves competitive in-domain performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain generalization. Its superiority is especially evident under low-resource conditions, indicating stronger robustness across domains.</description>

      <title>HoloLLM: Multisensory Foundation Model for Language-Grounded Human Sensing and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human perception for effective object tracking in 2D video streams arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge and semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings, while neglecting 3D geometric cues, making them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to infer geometric cues from only a few 2D images. To address the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing. By leveraging null-space constraints during model updates, it incorporates geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.

      <title>A Very Big Video Reasoning Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .</description>
