      <title>Preservation under Reduced Products in Continuous Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fragment of continuous first-order logic, analogue of Palyutin formulas (or h-formulas) in classical model theory, which is preserved under reduced products in both directions. We use it to extend classical results on complete theories which are preserved under reduced product and their stability. We also characterize the set of Palyutin sentences, Palyutin theories and other related fragments in terms of their preservation properties, both in the classical setting and the metric one.</description>

      <title>Universal-existential theories of fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various universal-existential fragments of first-order theories of fields, in particular of function fields and of equicharacteristic henselian valued fields. For example we discuss to what extent the theory of a field k determines the universal-existential theories of the rational function field over k and of the field of Laurent series over k, and we find various many-one reductions between such fragments.</description>

      <title>Comer Schemes, Relation Algebras, and the Flexible Atom Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.11914v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider relational structures arising from Comer's finite field construction, where the cosets need not be sum free. These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. This leaves $33_{65}$ as the only remaining relation algebra in the family $N_{65}$ with a flexible atom that is not known to be finitely representable. Motivated by this, we complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we show that $33_{65}$ is not finitely representable on fewer than $24$ points, and that $33_{65}$ does not admit a cyclic group representation on fewer than $120$ points. We also employ a SAT solver to show that $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points.</description>

      <title>Visser frames for sublogics of $\mathbf{IL}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modal completeness and the finite frame property of several sublogics of the logic $\mathbf{IL}$ of interpretability with respect to Visser frames, which are also called simplified Veltman frames. Among other things, we prove that the logic $\mathbf{CL}$ of conservativity has the finite frame property with respect to that frames. This is an affirmative solution to Ignatiev's problem.</description>

      <title>Embedded Finite Models Beyond Restricted Quantifier Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit evaluation of logical formulas that allow both uninterpreted relations, constrained to be finite, as well as an interpreted vocabulary over an infinite domain. This formalism was denoted embedded finite model theory in the past.
  It is clear that the expressiveness and evaluating complexity of formulas of this type depends heavily on the infinite structure. If we embed in a wild structure like the integers with additive and multiplicative arithmetic, logic is extremely expressive and formulas are impossible to evaluate. On the other hand, for some well-known decidable structures, the expressiveness and evaluating complexity are similar to the situation without the additional infrastructure. The latter phenomenon was formalized via the notion of ``Restricted Quantifier Collapse'': adding quantification over the infinite structure does not add expressiveness. Beyond these two extremes little was known.
  In this work we show that the possibilities for expressiveness and complexity are much wider. We show that we can get almost any possible complexity of evaluation while staying within a decidable structure. We also show that in some decidable structures, there is a disconnect between expressiveness of the logic and complexity, in that we cannot eliminate quantification over the structure, but this is not due to an ability to embed complex relational computation in the logic.
  We show failure of collapse for the theory of finite fields and the related theory of pseudo-finite fields, which will involve coding computation in the logic. As a by-product of this, we establish new lower-bounds for the complexity of decision procedures for several decidable theories of fields, including the theory of finite fields.
  In the process of investigating this landscape, we investigate several weakenings of collapse.</description>
