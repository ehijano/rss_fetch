      <title>Optimized two-stage AI-based Neural Decoding for Enhanced Visual Stimulus Reconstruction from fMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based neural decoding reconstructs visual perception by leveraging generative models to map brain activity, measured through functional MRI (fMRI), into latent hierarchical representations. Traditionally, ridge linear models transform fMRI into a latent space, which is then decoded using latent diffusion models (LDM) via a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Due to the complexity and noisiness of fMRI data, newer approaches split the reconstruction into two sequential steps, the first one providing a rough visual approximation, the second on improving the stimulus prediction via LDM endowed by CLIP embeddings. This work proposes a non-linear deep network to improve fMRI latent space representation, optimizing the dimensionality alike. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset showed that the proposed architecture improved the structural similarity of the reconstructed image by about 2\% with respect to the state-of-the-art model, based on ridge linear transform. The reconstructed image's semantics improved by about 4\%, measured by perceptual similarity, with respect to the state-of-the-art. The noise sensitivity analysis of the LDM showed that the role of the first stage was fundamental to predict the stimulus featuring high structural similarity. Conversely, providing a large noise stimulus affected less the semantics of the predicted stimulus, while the structural similarity between the ground truth and predicted stimulus was very poor. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging non-linear relationships between BOLD signal and the latent representation and two-stage generative AI for optimizing the fidelity of reconstructed visual stimuli from noisy fMRI data.</description>

      <title>In-context learning for medical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annotation of medical images, such as MRI and CT scans, is crucial for evaluating treatment efficacy and planning radiotherapy. However, the extensive workload of medical professionals limits their ability to annotate large image datasets, posing a bottleneck for AI applications in medical imaging. To address this, we propose In-context Cascade Segmentation (ICS), a novel method that minimizes annotation requirements while achieving high segmentation accuracy for sequential medical images. ICS builds on the UniverSeg framework, which performs few-shot segmentation using support images without additional training. By iteratively adding the inference results of each slice to the support set, ICS propagates information forward and backward through the sequence, ensuring inter-slice consistency. We evaluate the proposed method on the HVSMR dataset, which includes segmentation tasks for eight cardiac regions. Experimental results demonstrate that ICS significantly improves segmentation performance in complex anatomical regions, particularly in maintaining boundary consistency across slices, compared to baseline methods. The study also highlights the impact of the number and position of initial support slices on segmentation accuracy. ICS offers a promising solution for reducing annotation burdens while delivering robust segmentation results, paving the way for its broader adoption in clinical and research applications.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Tri-Branch Invertible Block for Image Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution (HR) images are commonly downscaled to low-resolution (LR) to reduce bandwidth, followed by upscaling to restore their original details. Recent advancements in image rescaling algorithms have employed invertible neural networks (INNs) to create a unified framework for downscaling and upscaling, ensuring a one-to-one mapping between LR and HR images. Traditional methods, utilizing dual-branch based vanilla invertible blocks, process high-frequency and low-frequency information separately, often relying on specific distributions to model high-frequency components. However, processing the low-frequency component directly in the RGB domain introduces channel redundancy, limiting the efficiency of image reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play tri-branch invertible block (T-InvBlocks) that decomposes the low-frequency branch into luminance (Y) and chrominance (CbCr) components, reducing redundancy and enhancing feature processing. Additionally, we adopt an all-zero mapping strategy for high-frequency components during upscaling, focusing essential rescaling information within the LR image. Our T-InvBlocks can be seamlessly integrated into existing rescaling models, improving performance in both general rescaling tasks and scenarios involving lossy compression. Extensive experiments confirm that our method advances the state of the art in HR image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Read Like a Radiologist: Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Imaging Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image interpretation. However extending them to 3D medical imaging has been challenging due to computational complexities and data scarcity. Although a few recent VLMs specified for 3D medical imaging have emerged, all are limited to learning volumetric representation of a 3D medical image as a set of sub-volumetric features. Such process introduces overly correlated representations along the z-axis that neglect slice-specific clinical details, particularly for 3D medical images where adjacent slices have low redundancy. To address this limitation, we introduce MS-VLM that mimic radiologists' workflow in 3D medical image interpretation. Specifically, radiologists analyze 3D medical images by examining individual slices sequentially and synthesizing information across slices and views. Likewise, MS-VLM leverages self-supervised 2D transformer encoders to learn a volumetric representation that capture inter-slice dependencies from a sequence of slice-specific features. Unbound by sub-volumetric patchification, MS-VLM is capable of obtaining useful volumetric representations from 3D medical images with any slice length and from multiple images acquired from different planes and phases. We evaluate MS-VLM on publicly available chest CT dataset CT-RATE and in-house rectal MRI dataset. In both scenarios, MS-VLM surpasses existing methods in radiology report generation, producing more coherent and clinically relevant reports. These findings highlight the potential of MS-VLM to advance 3D medical image interpretation and improve the robustness of medical VLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks, have transformed the landscape of image classification by autonomously extracting features directly from raw pixel data. This article introduces an innovative image classification model that employs three consecutive inception blocks within a convolutional neural networks framework, providing a comprehensive comparative analysis with well-established architectures such as Visual Geometry Group, Residual Network, and MobileNet. Through the utilization of benchmark datasets, including Canadian Institute for Advanced Researc, Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, and Fashion Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, we assess the performance of our proposed model in comparison to these benchmarks. The outcomes reveal that our novel model consistently outperforms its counterparts across diverse datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and potential for advancing the current state-of-the-art in image classification. Evaluation metrics further emphasize that the proposed model surpasses the other compared architectures, thereby enhancing the efficiency of image classification on standard datasets.</description>

      <title>ICA-based Resting-State Networks Obtained on Large Autism fMRI Dataset ABIDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become instrumental in researching brain function. One application of fMRI is investigating potential neural features that distinguish people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from healthy controls. The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) facilitates this research through its extensive data-sharing initiative. While ABIDE offers data preprocessed with various atlases, independent component analysis (ICA) for dimensionality reduction remains underutilized. We address this gap by presenting ICA-based resting-state networks (RSNs) from preprocessed scans from ABIDE, now publicly available: https://github.com/SjirSchielen/groupICAonABIDE. These RSNs unveil neural activation clusters without atlas constraints, offering a perspective on ASD analyses that complements the predominantly atlas-based literature. This contribution provides a valuable resource for further research into ASD, potentially aiding in developing new analytical approaches.</description>

      <title>Diagnosising Helicobacter pylori using AutoEncoders and Limited Annotations through Anomalous Staining Patterns in IHC Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This work addresses the detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in histological images with immunohistochemical staining. This analysis is a time demanding task, currently done by an expert pathologist that visually inspects the samples. Given the effort required to localise the pathogen in images, a limited number of annotations might be available in an initial setting. Our goal is to design an approach that, using a limited set of annotations, is capable of obtaining results good enough to be used as a support tool. Methods: We propose to use autoencoders to learn the latent patterns of healthy patches and formulate a specific measure of the reconstruction error of the image in HSV space. ROC analysis is used to set the optimal threshold of this measure and the percentage of positive patches in a sample that determines the presence of H. pylori. Results: Our method has been tested on an own database of 245 Whole Slide Images (WSI) having 117 cases without H. pylori and different density of the bacteria in the remaining ones. The database has 1211 annotated patches, with only 163 positive patches. This dataset of positive annotations was used to train a baseline thresholding and an SVM using the features of a pre-trained RedNet18 and ViT models. A 10-fold cross-validation shows that our method has better performance with 91% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, 96% specificity and 0.97 AUC in the diagnosis of H. pylori. Conclusion: Unlike classification approaches, our shallow autoencoder with threshold adaptation for the detection of anomalous staining is able to achieve competitive results with a limited set of annotated data. This initial approach is good enough to be used as a guide for fast annotation of infected patches.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Resilient Analog Neuromorphic Chip in Single-Polysilicon CMOS Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analog neuromorphic chips, designers can embed computing primitives in the intrinsic physical properties of devices and circuits, heavily reducing device count and energy consumption, and enabling high parallelism, because all devices are computing simultaneously. Neural network parameters can be stored in local analog non-volatile memories (NVMs), saving the energy required to move data between memory and logic. However, the main drawback of analog sub-threshold electronic circuits is their dramatic temperature sensitivity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a temperature compensation mechanism can be devised to solve this problem. We have designed and fabricated a chip implementing a two-layer analog neural network trained to classify low-resolution images of handwritten digits with a low-cost single-poly complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, using unconventional analog NVMs for weight storage. We demonstrate a temperature-resilient analog neuromorphic chip for image recognition operating between 10$^{\circ}$C and 60$^{\circ}$C without loss of classification accuracy, within 2\% of the corresponding software-based neural network in the whole temperature range.</description>

      <title>Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning for improved Convolutional Baseline for Brain Tumor Segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa Adult Glioma Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning methods is an ongoing challenge in medical imaging. Multiple lingering issues exist including domain-shift and applications in low-resource settings which brings a unique set of challenges including scarcity of data. As a step towards solving these specific problems, we propose Convolutional adapter-inspired Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) of MedNeXt architecture. To validate our idea, we show our method performs comparable to full fine-tuning with the added benefit of reduced training compute using BraTS-2021 as pre-training dataset and BraTS-Africa as the fine-tuning dataset. BraTS-Africa consists of a small dataset (60 train / 35 validation) from the Sub-Saharan African population with marked shift in the MRI quality compared to BraTS-2021 (1251 train samples). We first show that models trained on BraTS-2021 dataset do not generalize well to BraTS-Africa as shown by 20% reduction in mean dice on BraTS-Africa validation samples. Then, we show that PEFT can leverage both the BraTS-2021 and BraTS-Africa dataset to obtain mean dice of 0.8 compared to 0.72 when trained only on BraTS-Africa. Finally, We show that PEFT (0.80 mean dice) results in comparable performance to full fine-tuning (0.77 mean dice) which may show PEFT to be better on average but the boxplots show that full finetuning results is much lesser variance in performance. Nevertheless, on disaggregation of the dice metrics, we find that the model has tendency to oversegment as shown by high specificity (0.99) compared to relatively low sensitivity(0.75).

      <title>Targeted View-Invariant Adversarial Perturbations for 3D Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in 3D object recognition, especially in scenarios involving multi-view analysis where objects can be observed from varying angles. This paper introduces View-Invariant Adversarial Perturbations (VIAP), a novel method for crafting robust adversarial examples that remain effective across multiple viewpoints. Unlike traditional methods, VIAP enables targeted attacks capable of manipulating recognition systems to classify objects as specific, pre-determined labels, all while using a single universal perturbation. Leveraging a dataset of 1,210 images across 121 diverse rendered 3D objects, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VIAP in both targeted and untargeted settings. Our untargeted perturbations successfully generate a singular adversarial noise robust to 3D transformations, while targeted attacks achieve exceptional results, with top-1 accuracies exceeding 95% across various epsilon values. These findings highlight VIAPs potential for real-world applications, such as testing the robustness of 3D recognition systems. The proposed method sets a new benchmark for view-invariant adversarial robustness, advancing the field of adversarial machine learning for 3D object recognition.</description>

      <title>DarkIR: Robust Low-Light Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photography during night or in dark conditions typically suffers from noise, low light and blurring issues due to the dim environment and the common use of long exposure. Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

      <title>Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D anomaly detection has recently become a significant focus in computer vision. Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception (ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine (SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 4.2% and 13.1%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Urban Air Temperature Prediction using Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urbanization as a global trend has led to many environmental challenges, including the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The increase in temperature has a significant impact on the well-being of urban residents. Air temperature ($T_a$) at 2m above the surface is a key indicator of the UHI effect. How land use land cover (LULC) affects $T_a$ is a critical research question which requires high-resolution (HR) $T_a$ data at neighborhood scale. However, weather stations providing $T_a$ measurements are sparsely distributed e.g. more than 10km apart; and numerical models are impractically slow and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel method to predict HR $T_a$ at 100m ground separation distance (gsd) using land surface temperature (LST) and other LULC related features which can be easily obtained from satellite imagery. Our method leverages diffusion models for the first time to generate accurate and visually realistic HR $T_a$ maps, which outperforms prior methods. We pave the way for meteorological research using computer vision techniques by providing a dataset of an extended spatial and temporal coverage, and a high spatial resolution as a benchmark for future research. Furthermore, we show that our model can be applied to urban planning by simulating the impact of different urban designs on $T_a$.</description>

      <title>Step-Calibrated Diffusion for Biomedical Optical Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

      <title>Are Vision xLSTM Embedded UNet More Reliable in Medical 3D Image Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of efficient segmentation strategies for medical images has evolved from its initial dependence on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the current investigation of hybrid models that combine CNNs with Vision Transformers. There is an increasing focus on creating architectures that are both high-performance and computationally efficient, able to be deployed on remote systems with limited resources. Although transformers can capture global dependencies in the input space, they face challenges from the corresponding high computational and storage expenses involved. This paper investigates the integration of CNNs with Vision Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Vision-xLSTM)s by introducing the novel {\it \textbf{U-VixLSTM}}.
  The Vision-xLSTM blocks capture temporal and global relationships within the patches, as extracted from the CNN feature maps. The convolutional feature reconstruction path upsamples the output volume from the Vision-xLSTM blocks, to produce the segmentation output. Our primary objective is to propose that Vision-xLSTM forms an appropriate backbone for medical image segmentation, offering excellent performance with reduced computational costs. The U-VixLSTM exhibits superior performance, compared to the state-of-the-art networks in the publicly available Synapse, ISIC and ACDC datasets.

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a time-efficient approach to quantitative MRI, enabling the mapping of multiple tissue properties from a single, accelerated scan. However, achieving accurate reconstructions remains challenging, particularly in highly accelerated and undersampled acquisitions, which are crucial for reducing scan times. While deep learning techniques have advanced image reconstruction, the recent introduction of diffusion models offers new possibilities for imaging tasks, though their application in the medical field is still emerging. Notably, diffusion models have not yet been explored for the MRF problem. In this work, we propose for the first time a conditional diffusion probabilistic model for MRF image reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons on in-vivo brain scan data demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform established deep learning and compressed sensing algorithms for MRF reconstruction. Extensive ablation studies also explore strategies to improve computational efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Semantic Asymmetry for Precise Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Planning CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), clinicians typically delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV) using non-contrast planning computed tomography to ensure accurate radiation dose delivery. However, the low contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues necessitates that radiation oncologists manually delineate the tumors, often relying on diagnostic MRI for guidance. % In this study, we propose a novel approach to directly segment NPC gross tumors on non-contrast planning CT images, circumventing potential registration errors when aligning MRI or MRI-derived tumor masks to planning CT. To address the low contrast issues between tumors and adjacent normal structures in planning CT, we introduce a 3D Semantic Asymmetry Tumor segmentation (SATs) method. Specifically, we posit that a healthy nasopharyngeal region is characteristically bilaterally symmetric, whereas the emergence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma disrupts this symmetry. Then, we propose a Siamese contrastive learning segmentation framework that minimizes the voxel-wise distance between original and flipped areas without tumor and encourages a larger distance between original and flipped areas with tumor. Thus, our approach enhances the sensitivity of features to semantic asymmetries. % Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SATs achieves the leading NPC GTV segmentation performance in both internal and external testing, \emph{e.g.}, with at least 2\% absolute Dice score improvement and 12\% average distance error reduction when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the external testing.</description>

Abstract: Volumetric video, which offers immersive viewing experiences, is gaining increasing prominence. With its six degrees of freedom, it provides viewers with greater immersion and interactivity compared to traditional videos. Despite their potential, volumetric video services pose significant challenges. This survey conducts a comprehensive review of the existing literature on volumetric video. We firstly provide a general framework of volumetric video services, followed by a discussion on prerequisites for volumetric video, encompassing representations, open datasets, and quality assessment metrics. Then we delve into the current methodologies for each stage of the volumetric video service pipeline, detailing capturing, compression, transmission, rendering, and display techniques. Lastly, we explore various applications enabled by this pioneering technology and we present an array of research challenges and opportunities in the domain of volumetric video services. This survey aspires to provide a holistic understanding of this burgeoning field and shed light on potential future research trajectories, aiming to bring the vision of volumetric video to fruition.</description>

      <title>ReXplain: Translating Radiology into Patient-Friendly Video Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiology reports, designed for efficient communication between medical experts, often remain incomprehensible to patients. This inaccessibility could potentially lead to anxiety, decreased engagement in treatment decisions, and poorer health outcomes, undermining patient-centered care. We present ReXplain (Radiology eXplanation), an innovative AI-driven system that translates radiology findings into patient-friendly video reports. ReXplain uniquely integrates a large language model for medical text simplification and text-anatomy association, an image segmentation model for anatomical region identification, and an avatar generation tool for engaging interface visualization. ReXplain enables producing comprehensive explanations with plain language, highlighted imagery, and 3D organ renderings in the form of video reports. To evaluate the utility of ReXplain-generated explanations, we conducted two rounds of user feedback collection from six board-certified radiologists. The results of this proof-of-concept study indicate that ReXplain could accurately deliver radiological information and effectively simulate one-on-one consultation, shedding light on enhancing patient-centered radiology with potential clinical usage. This work demonstrates a new paradigm in AI-assisted medical communication, potentially improving patient engagement and satisfaction in radiology care, and opens new avenues for research in multimodal medical communication.</description>

      <title>A Novel Generative Multi-Task Representation Learning Approach for Predicting Postoperative Complications in Cardiac Surgery Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of surgical complications allows for timely therapy and proactive risk mitigation. Machine learning (ML) can be leveraged to identify and predict patient risks for postoperative complications. We developed and validated the effectiveness of predicting postoperative complications using a novel surgical Variational Autoencoder (surgVAE) that uncovers intrinsic patterns via cross-task and cross-cohort presentation learning. This retrospective cohort study used data from the electronic health records of adult surgical patients over four years (2018 - 2021). Six key postoperative complications for cardiac surgery were assessed: acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, blood transfusion, and other intraoperative cardiac events. We compared prediction performances of surgVAE against widely-used ML models and advanced representation learning and generative models under 5-fold cross-validation. 89,246 surgeries (49% male, median (IQR) age: 57 (45-69)) were included, with 6,502 in the targeted cardiac surgery cohort (61% male, median (IQR) age: 60 (53-70)). surgVAE demonstrated superior performance over existing ML solutions across all postoperative complications of cardiac surgery patients, achieving macro-averaged AUPRC of 0.409 and macro-averaged AUROC of 0.831, which were 3.4% and 3.7% higher, respectively, than the best alternative method (by AUPRC scores). Model interpretation using Integrated Gradients highlighted key risk factors based on preoperative variable importance. surgVAE showed excellent discriminatory performance for predicting postoperative complications and addressing the challenges of data complexity, small cohort sizes, and low-frequency positive events. surgVAE enables data-driven predictions of patient risks and prognosis while enhancing the interpretability of patient risk profiles.</description>

      <title>GN-FR:Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flare, an optical phenomenon resulting from unwanted scattering and reflections within a lens system, presents a significant challenge in imaging. The diverse patterns of flares, such as halos, streaks, color bleeding, and haze, complicate the flare removal process. Existing traditional and learning-based methods have exhibited limited efficacy due to their reliance on single-image approaches, where flare removal is highly ill-posed. We address this by framing flare removal as a multi-view image problem, taking advantage of the view-dependent nature of flare artifacts. This approach leverages information from neighboring views to recover details obscured by flare in individual images. Our proposed framework, GN-FR (Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal), can render flare-free views from a sparse set of input images affected by lens flare and generalizes across different scenes in an unsupervised manner. GN-FR incorporates several modules within the Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT) framework: Flare-occupancy Mask Generation (FMG), View Sampler (VS), and Point Sampler (PS). To overcome the impracticality of capturing both flare-corrupted and flare-free data, we introduce a masking loss function that utilizes mask information in an unsupervised setting. Additionally, we present a 3D multi-view flare dataset, comprising 17 real flare scenes with 782 images, 80 real flare patterns, and their corresponding annotated flare-occupancy masks. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address flare removal within a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) framework.</description>
