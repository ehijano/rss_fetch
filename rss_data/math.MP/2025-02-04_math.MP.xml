      <title>Resolving the Problem of Multiple Control Parameters in Optimized Borel-Type Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most often used methods of summing divergent series in physics is the Borel-type summation with control parameters improving convergence, which are defined by some optimization conditions. The well known annoying problem in this procedure is the occurrence of multiple solutions for control parameters. We suggest a method for resolving this problem, based on the minimization of cost functional. Control parameters can be introduced by employing the Borel-Leroy or Mittag-Leffler transforms. Also, two novel transformations are proposed using fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. New cost functionals are advanced, based on lasso and ridge selection criteria, and their performance is studied for a number of models. The developed method is shown to provide good accuracy for the calculated quantities.</description>

      <title>Non-self-adjoint Dirac operators on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study generally non-self-adjoint realizations of the Dirac operator on an arbitrary finite metric graph. Employing the robust boundary triple framework, we derive, in particular, a variant of the Birman Schwinger principle for its eigenvalues, and with an example of a star shaped graph we show that the point spectrum may exhibit diverse behaviour. Subsequently, we find sufficient and necessary conditions on transmission conditions at the graph's vertices under which the Dirac operator on the graph is symmetric with respect to the parity, the time reversal, or the charge conjugation transformation.</description>

      <title>Physical quantities as a partially additive field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of a field by allowing addition to be a partial operation. We show that elements of such a "partially additive field" share many similarities with physical quantities. In particular, they form subsets of mutually summable elements (similar to physical dimensions), dimensionless elements (those summable with 1) form a field, and every element can be uniquely represented as a product of a dimensionless element and any non-zero element of the same dimension (a unit). We also discuss the conditions for the existence of a coherent unit system. In contrast to previous works, our axiomatization encompasses quantities, values, units, and dimensions in a single algebraic structure, illustrating that partial operations may provide a more elegant description of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Vortices for the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau theory in curved space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the Ginzburg-Landau theory is concerned with macroscopic phenomena, and gravity affects how objects interact at the macroscopic level. It becomes relevant to study the Ginzburg-Landau theory in curved space, that is, in the presence of gravity. In this paper, some existence theorems are established for the vortex solutions of the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau theory coupled to the Einstein equations. First, when the coupling constant \lambda=1, we get a self-dual structure from the Ginzburg-Landau theory, then a partial differential equation with a gravitational term that has power-type singularities is deduced from the coupled system. To overcome the difficulty arising from the orders of singularities at the vortices, a constraint minimization method and a monotone iteration method are employed. We also show that the quantized flux and total curvature are determined by the number of vortices. Second, when the coupling constant \lambda&gt;0, we use a suitable ansatz to get the radially symmetric case for the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau theory in curved space. The existence of the symmetric vortex solutions are obtained through combining a two-step iterative shooting argument and a fixed-point theorem approach. Some fundamental properties of the solutions are established via applying a series of analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Calibrated hypergraph states: I calibrated hypergraph and multi qudit state monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph states are a special kind of multipartite states encoded by hypergraphs. They play a significant role in quantum error correction, measurement--based quantum computation, quantum non locality and entanglement. In a series of two papers, we introduce and study calibrated hypergraph states, a broad generalization of weighted hypergraph states codified by hypergraphs equipped with calibrations, an ample extension of weightings. We propose as a guiding principle that a constructive theory of hypergraph states must be based on a categorical framework for hypergraphs on one hand and multi qudit states on the other constraining hypergraph states enough to render the determination of their general structure possible. In this first paper, we introduce graded $\varOmega$ monads, concrete Pro categories isomorphic to the Pro category $\varOmega$ of finite von Neumann ordinals and equipped with an associative and unital graded multiplication, and their morphisms, maps of $\varOmega$ monads compatible with their monadic structure. We then show that both calibrated hypergraphs and multi qudit states naturally organize in graded $\varOmega$ monads. In this way, we lay the foundation for the construction of calibrated hypergraph state map as a special morphism of these $\varOmega$ monads in the companion paper.</description>

In a series of two papers, we introduce and investigate calibrated hypergraph states, an extension of weighted hypergraph states codified by hypergraphs equipped with calibrations, a broad generalization of weightings. The guiding principle informing our approach is that a constructive theory of hypergraph states must be based on a categorical framework for both hypergraphs and multi qudit states constraining hypergraph states enough to render the determination of their general structure possible. In this second paper, we build upon the graded $\varOmega$ monadic framework worked out in the companion paper, focusing on qudits over a generic Galois ring. We explicitly construct a calibrated hypergraph state map as a special morphism of the calibrated hypergraph and multi qudit state $\varOmega$ monads. We further prove that the calibrated hypergraph states so yielded are locally maximally entangleable stabilizer states, elucidate their relationship to weighted hypergraph states, show that they reduce to the weighted ones in the familiar qubit case and prove through examples that this is no longer the case for higher qudits.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to hypergeometric class functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric class equations are given by second
  order differential operators in one variable whose coefficient at the second derivative
  is a polynomial of degree $\leq2$, at the first derivative of degree
  $\leq1$ and the free term is a number. Their solutions, called hypergeometric class functions, include the Gauss hypergeometric function and its various limiting cases. The paper presents a unified approach to these functions. The main structure behind this approach is a family of complex 4-dimensional Lie algebras, originally due to Willard Miller. Hypergeometric class functions can be interpreted as eigenfunctions of the quadratic Casimir operator in a representation of Miller's Lie algebra given by differential operators in three complex variables. One obtains a unified treatment of various properties of hypergeometric class functions such as recurrence relations, discrete symmetries, power series expansions, integral representations, generating functions and orthogonality of polynomial solutions.</description>

      <title>Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation in terms of Neumann series of Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation is obtained. The solutions are represented as Neumann series of Bessel functions. The representations are shown to be uniformly convergent with respect to the spectral parameter. Explicit formulas for the coefficients are obtained via a system of recursive integrals. The result is based on the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. An efficient numerical method for solving initial-value and spectral problems based on this approach is presented with a numerical example. The method can compute large sets of eigendata with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>Canonical Commutation Relations: A quick proof of the Stone-von Neumann theorem and an extension to general rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a (not necessary commutative) ring with unit, $d\geq 1$ an integer, and $\lambda$ a unitary character of the additive group $(R,+).$ A pair $(U,V)$ of unitary representations $U$ and $V$ of $R^d$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is said to satisfy the canonical commutation relations (relative to $\lambda$) if $U(a) V(b)= \lambda(a\cdot b)V(b) U(a)$ for all $a=(a_1, \dots, a_d), b= (b_1, \dots, b_d)\in R^d$, where $a\cdot b= \sum_{k=1}^d a_k b_k.$ We give a new and quick proof of the classical Stone von Neumann Theorem about the essential uniqueness of such a pair in the case where $R$ is a local field (e.g. $R= \mathbf{R}$). Our methods allow us to give the following extension of this result to a general locally compact ring $R$. For a unitary representation $U$ of $R^d$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}, $ define the inflation $U^{(\infty)}$ of $U$ as the (countably) infinite multiple of $U$ on $\mathcal{H}^{(\infty)}=\oplus_{i\in \mathbf{N}} \mathcal{H}$. Let $(U_1, V_1), (U_2, V_2)$ be two pairs of unitary representations of $R^d$ on corresponding Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}_1, \mathcal{H}_2$ satisfying the canonical commutation relations (relative to $\lambda$). Provided that $\lambda$ satisfies a mild faithful condition, we show that the inflations $(U_1^{(\infty)}, V_1^{(\infty)}), (U_2^{(\infty)}, V_2^{(\infty)})$ are approximately equivalent, that is, there exists a sequence $(\Phi_n)_n$ of unitary isomorphisms $\Phi_n: \mathcal{H}_1^{(\infty)}\to \mathcal{H}_2^{(\infty)}$ such that $\lim_{n} \Vert U_2^{(\infty)}(a) - \Phi_n U_1^{(\infty)}(a) \Phi_n^{*}\Vert=0$ and $\lim_{n} \Vert V_2^{(\infty)}(b) - \Phi_n V_1^{(\infty)}(b) \Phi_n^{*}\Vert=0,$ uniformly on compact subsets of $R^d.$</description>

      <title>A Simple and General Equation for Matrix Product Unitary Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the local analyticity for the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Euler equations with initial conditions that exhibit analytic regularity near the boundary and Sobolev regularity away from it. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of the diamond-analyticity framework, which captures the spatial decay of the analyticity radius in a structured manner, improving upon uniform analyticity approaches. We employ the Leray projection and a nonstandard mollification technique to demonstrate that the quotient between the imaginary and real parts of the analyticity radius remains unrestricted, thus extending the analyticity persistence results beyond traditional constraints. Our methodology combines analytic-Sobolev estimates with an iterative scheme which is nonstandard in the Cauchy-Kowalevskaya framework, ensuring rigorous control over the evolution of the solution. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between analyticity and boundary effects in fluid equations. They might have implications for the study of the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations and the role of complex singularities in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous spin $q$-Whittaker polynomials are a family of symmetric polynomials which generalize the Macdonald polynomials at $t=0$. In this paper we prove that they are orthogonal with respect to a variant of the Sklyanin measure on the $n$ dimensional torus and as a result they form a basis of the space of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables. Instrumental to the proof are inhomogeneous eigenrelations, which partially generalize those of Macdonald polynomials. We also consider several special cases of the inhomogeneous spin $q$-Whittaker polynomials, which include variants of symmetric Grothendieck polynomials or spin Whittaker functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies properties of acoustic operators in bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega$ with m-dissipative generalized impedance boundary conditions. We prove that such acoustic operators have a compact resolvent if and only if the impedance operator from the trace space $H^{1/2} (\partial \Omega)$ to the other trace space $H^{-1/2} (\partial \Omega)$ is compact. This result is applied to the question of the discreteness of the spectrum and to the particular cases of damping and impedance boundary conditions. The method of the paper is based on abstract results written in terms of boundary tuples and is applicable to other types of wave equations.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Between Compatibility and Deterministic Underlying States in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between the pairwise compatibility of all observables in a scenario, and our ability to create a deterministic underlying-state model for that scenario (a type of hidden-variable model, typically used in the contextuality and nonlocality literature, where quantum states are treated as probability measures over ``better-defined states''). We first argue that the quantum state update rule implies that underlying-state models must update their states in agreement with the rules of conditional probability. We then demonstrate that deterministic underlying-state models meeting this criterion exist if and only if the system's observables are pairwise compatible, which is equivalent to the theoretical predictions of sequential measurements being independent of measurement order.</description>

      <title>A coupled finite and boundary spectral element method for linear water-wave propagation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coupled boundary spectral element method (BSEM) and spectral element method (SEM) formulation for the propagation of small-amplitude water waves over variable bathymetries is presented in this work. The wave model is based on the mild-slope equation (MSE), which provides a good approximation of the propagation of water waves over irregular bottom surfaces with slopes up to 1:3. In unbounded domains or infinite regions, space can be divided into two different areas: a central region of interest, where an irregular bathymetry is included, and an exterior infinite region with straight and parallel bathymetric lines. The SEM allows us to model the central region, where any variation of the bathymetry can be considered, while the exterior infinite region is modelled by the BSEM which, combined with the fundamental solution presented by Cerrato et al. [A. Cerrato, J. A. Gonz\'alez, L. Rodr\'iguez-Tembleque, Boundary element formulation of the mild-slope equation for harmonic water waves propagating over unidirectional variable bathymetries, Eng. Anal. Boundary Elem. 62 (2016) 22-34.] can include bathymetries with straight and parallel contour lines. This coupled model combines important advantages of both methods; it benefits from the flexibility of the SEM for the interior region and, at the same time, includes the fulfilment of the Sommerfeld's radiation condition for the exterior problem, that is provided by the BSEM. The solution approximation inside the elements is constructed by high order Legendre polynomials associated with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points, providing a spectral convergence for both methods. The proposed formulation has been validated in three different benchmark cases with different shapes of the bottom surface. The solutions exhibit the typical p-convergence of spectral methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-plectic geometry of the six-sphere induced by pulling back a canonical $G_2$-invariant three-form from $\mathbb{R}^7$ . Notably we explicitly prove non-flatness of this structure and show that its infinitesimal automorphisms are given by the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$. Several interesting classes of solutions of the dynamical Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl equations with one- and two-dimensional sources are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States in Field Theory: No Partial Factorization, Multi-Particle Packaging, and Hybrid Gauge-Invariant Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that local gauge invariance and superselection rules enforce a ``packaging'' principle for quantum field excitations: \textbf{internal quantum numbers (IQNs)} such as charge, color, or flavor are locked into \textbf{irreducible representation (irrep)} blocks. At the single-particle level, this packaging principle forbids the partial factorization of IQNs (e.g.\ ``half an electron charge'' or ``just the color quantum number of a quark''). Extending to multi-particle states, superselection restricts the net gauge charge to a single sector, eliminating cross-sector Bell-type superpositions while permitting packaged entangled states within one superselection sector.  We provide rigorous theorems clarifying (i)~why no partial factorization of IQNs is possible, (ii)~how multi-particle superpositions remain gauge-invariant within a single net-charge sector, and (iii)~how external \textbf{degrees of freedom (DOFs)} (spin, momentum) can be hybridized with these internal charges to form gauge-invariant entanglement. We also discuss how measurements of spin or momentum in such hybrid states lead to collapse of the internal entanglement.  The interplay of gauge constraints and superselection thus gives quantum field states a nontrivial information-theoretic structure: \textit{internal charges must be packaged with each particle's creation operator, yet multi-particle states may form entangled superpositions so long as the net charge remains consistent}.</description>

      <title>Coulomb correlated multi-particle polarons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Vaidya-type solutions in Weyl conformal gravity (WCG) using Eddington--Finkelstein-like coordinates. Our considerations focus on spherical as well as hyperbolic and planar symmetries. In particular, we find all vacuum dynamical solutions for the aforementioned symmetries. These are, in contrast to general relativity, structurally quite non-trivial. We provide a thorough analysis of their basic properties, such as, relation to other known WCG solutions, algebraic types, singularities, horizons, and symmetries. In the same vein, we also derive, classify, and discuss non-vacuum solutions with the Coulombic electric field and null dust. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of WCG solutions to Einstein spaces and the role of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem, are also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations have proved to be a valuable governing framework for many real-world systems which exhibit ``noise'' or randomness in their evolution. One quality of interest in such systems is the shape of their equilibrium probability distribution, if such a thing exists. In some cases a straightforward integral equation may yield this steady-state distribution, but in other cases the equilibrium distribution exists and yet that integral equation diverges. Here we establish a new equilibrium-analysis technique based on the logic of finite-timestep simulation which allows us to glean information about the equilibrium regardless -- in particular, a relationship between the raw moments of the equilibrium distribution. We utilize this technique to extract information about one such equilibrium resistant to direct definition.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of geodesic midpoint fluctuations in last-passage percolation with general i.i.d. weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of transversal fluctuations of the optimal path is a crucial aspect of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this work, we establish the large deviation limit for the midpoint transversal fluctuations in a general last-passage percolation (LPP) model with mild assumption on the i.i.d. weights. The rate function is expressed in terms of the right tail large deviation rate function of the last-passage value and the shape function. When the weights are chosen to be i.i.d. exponential random variables, our result verifies a conjecture communicated to us by Liu [Liu'22], showing the asymptotic probability of the geodesic from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ following the corner path $(0,0) \to (n,0) \to (n,n)$ is $({4}/{e^2})^{n+o(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Direct inversion scheme of time-domain fluorescence diffuse optical tomography by asymptotic analysis of peak time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a direct inversion scheme for fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT) to reconstruct the location of a point target using the measured peak time of the temporal response functions. A sphere is defined for the target, with its radius determined by the peak time, indicating that the target lies on the sphere. By constructing a tetrahedron with edges determined by the radii, we identify the location of the target as the vertex of the tetrahedron. Asymptotically, we derive the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the peak time. Several numerical tests are implemented to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the asymptotic relationship and the inversion scheme.</description>

      <title>Bound states of 2+1 fermionic trimers on lattice at strong couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the bound states of $2+1$ fermionic trimers on a three-dimensional lattice at strong coupling. Specifically, we analyze the discrete spectrum of the associated three-body discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H_{\gamma,\lambda}(K),$ focusing on energies below the continuum and within its gap. Depending on the quasi-momentum $K,$ we show that if the mass ratio $\gamma&gt;0$ between the identical fermions and the third particle is below a certain threshold, the operator lacks a discrete spectrum below the essential spectrum for sufficiently large coupling $\lambda&gt;0.$ Conversely, if $\gamma$ exceeds this threshold, $H_{\gamma,\lambda}(K)$ admits at least one eigenvalue below the essential spectrum. Similar phenomena are observed in the neighborhood of the two-particle branch of the essential spectrum, which resides within the gap and grows sublinearly as $\lambda\to+\infty.$ For $K=0,$ the mass ratio thresholds are explicitly calculated and it turns out that, for certain intermediate mass ratios and large couplings, bound states emerge within the gap, although ground states are absent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the $\beta$-Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi ensembles of dimension $N$ there exist central limit theorems for the freezing case $\beta\to\infty$ such that the associated means and covariances can be expressed in terms of the associated Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials of order $N$ respectively as well as via the associated dual polynomials in the sense of de Boor and Saff. In this paper we derive limits for $N\to\infty$ for the covariances of the $r\in\mathbb N$ largest (and smallest) eigenvalues for these frozen Jacobi ensembles in terms of Bessel functions. These results correspond to the hard edge analysis in the frozen Laguerre cases by Andraus and Lerner-Brecher and to known results for finite $\beta$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study strong coupling asymptotic expansions of ${\mathcal N}=2$ $D=4$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory partition functions in general $\Omega$-background. This is done by refining Painlev\'e/gauge theory correspondence in terms of quantum Painlev\'e equations, obtained from $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations. We present a general ansatz and a systematic analysis of the expansions of the gauge theory partition functions by solving the above equations around the strong coupling singularities, including Argyres-Douglas points. We compare our results with refined holomorphic anomaly equations and irregular Virasoro conformal blocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently found that connection coefficients of the Heun equation can be derived in closed form using crossing symmetry in two-dimensional Liouville theory via the Nekrasov-Shatashvili functions. In this work, we systematize this approach to second-order linear ODEs of Fuchsian type, which arise in the description of N = 2, four-dimensional quiver gauge theories. After presenting the general procedure, we focus on the specific case of Fuchsian equations with five regular singularities and present some applications to black hole perturbation theory. First, we consider a massive scalar perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole in AdS7. Next, we analyze vector type perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS5 black hole. We also discuss the implications of our results in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence and present explicit results in the large spin limit, where we make connection with the light-cone bootstrap. Furthermore, using the spectral network technology, we identify the region of the moduli space in Seiberg-Witten theory that is relevant for the study of black hole quasinormal modes. Our results suggest that, in some cases, this region corresponds to the strong-coupling regime, highlighting the potential applicability of the conformal GMN TBA framework to address scenarios where the gravitational dictionary implies that the instanton counting parameters are not parametrically small.</description>

      <title>Additivity and chain rules for quantum entropies via multi-index Schatten norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary entropic measures for quantum states are additive under the tensor product. In the analysis of quantum information processing tasks, the minimum entropy of a set of states, e.g., the minimum output entropy of a channel, often plays a crucial role. A fundamental question in quantum information and cryptography is whether the minimum output entropy remains additive under the tensor product of channels. Here, we establish a general additivity statement for the optimized sandwiched R\'enyi entropy of quantum channels. For that, we generalize the results of [Devetak, Junge, King, Ruskai, CMP 2006] to multi-index Schatten norms. As an application, we strengthen the additivity statement of [Van Himbeeck and Brown, 2025] thus allowing the analysis of time-adaptive quantum cryptographic protocols. In addition, we establish chain rules for R\'enyi conditional entropies that are similar to the ones used for the generalized entropy accumulation theorem of [Metger, Fawzi, Sutter, Renner, CMP 2024].</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound on the Critical Momentum of an Impurity in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Bogoliubov-Fr\"ohlich model, we prove that an impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate forms a stable quasi-particle when the total momentum is less than its mass times the speed of sound. The system thus exhibits superfluid behavior, as this quasi-particle does not experience friction. We do not assume any infrared or ultraviolet regularization of the model, which contains massless excitations and point-like interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a brief history of how the famous Maximum Entropy Principle was used as closure of moments of the Boltzmann equation. In particular, we want to remark on the important role of two fundamental papers by Wolfgang Dreyer, one in the classical framework and one in a relativistic context, to use this principle and to compare the result with the macroscopic theory of Rational Extended Thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Consider the normalized adjacency matrices of random $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices with fixed degree $d\geq3$. We prove that, with probability $1-N^{-1+{\varepsilon}}$ for any ${\varepsilon} &gt;0$, the following two properties hold as $N \to \infty$ provided that $d\geq3$: (i) The eigenvalues are close to the classical eigenvalue locations given by the Kesten-McKay distribution. In particular, the extremal eigenvalues are concentrated with polynomial error bound in $N$, i.e. $\lambda_2, |\lambda_N|\leq 2+N^{-c}$. (ii) All eigenvectors of random $d$-regular graphs are completely delocalized.</description>

      <title>Cost of Simulating Entanglement in Steering Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, yet certain entangled states that are unsteerable can be classically simulated in steering scenarios, making them unable to exhibit non-locality in quantum steering. Despite their significance, a systematic comparison of such entangled states has not been fully explored. In this work, we quantify the resource content of unsteerable quantum states in terms of the amount of shared randomness required to simulate their dynamical behavior in the steering scenario. We rigorously demonstrate that the simulation cost is unbounded even for some two-qubit unsteerable states. Moreover, the simulation cost of entangled two-qubit states is always strictly greater than that for any separable state. \par
  A significant portion of our results rely on the relationship between the simulation cost of two-qubit Werner states and that of noisy spin measurements. Using noisy spin measurements as a central example, we investigate the minimal number of outcomes required for a parent measurement to simulate a given set of compatible measurements. Although some continuous sets of measurements can be simulated using a finite-outcome parent, we identify scenarios where the simulation cost diverges. Our results provide previously unknown lower bounds on the simulation cost, supported by connections between the simulation cost of noisy spin measurements and various geometric inequalities, including those studied in the zonotope-approximation problem in Banach space theory.</description>

      <title>Two invariant subalgebras of rational Cherednik algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally motivated by connections to integrable systems, two natural subalgebras of the rational Cherednik algebra have been considered in the literature. The first is the subalgebra generated by all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\rm T \subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}$ in ${\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}/W$.</description>

      <title>A sharp isoperimetric-type inequality for Lorentzian spaces satisfying timelike Ricci lower bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes a sharp and rigid isoperimetric-type inequality in Lorentzian signature under the assumption of Ricci curvature bounded below in the timelike directions. The inequality is proved in the high generality of Lorentzian pre-length spaces satisfying timelike Ricci lower bounds in a synthetic sense via optimal transport, the so-called $\mathsf{TCD}^e_p(K,N)$ spaces. The results are new already for smooth Lorentzian manifolds. Applications include an upper bound on the area of achronal hypersurfaces inside the interior of a black hole (original already in Schwarzschild) and an upper bound on the area of achronal hypersurfaces in cosmological spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hartree equation (NLH) in the Heisenberg picture admits steady states of the form $\gamma_f=f(-\Delta)$ representing quantum states of infinitely many particles. In this article, we consider the time evolution of perturbations from a large class of such steady states via the three-dimensional NLH. We prove that if the interaction potential $w$ has finite measure and initial states have finite relative entropy, then solutions preserve the relative free energy, and they exist globally in time. This result extends the important work of Lewin and Sabin [arXiv:1310.0603] to singular interaction cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over fourty years ago, the physicist Polyakov proposed a bold framework for string theory, in which the problem was reduced to the study of certain "random surfaces". He further made the tantalising suggestion that this theory could be explicitly solved. Recent breakthroughs from the last fifteen years have not only given a concrete mathematical basis for this theory but also verified some of its most striking predictions, as well as Polyakov's original vision. This theory, now known in the mathematics literature either as Liouville quantum gravity or Liouville conformal field theory, is based on a remarkable combination of ideas coming from different fields, above all probability and geometry. This book is intended to be an introduction to these developments assuming as few prerequisites as possible.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By formulating the axioms of quantum mechanics, von Neumann also laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory". As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of quantum mechanics was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  This work argues in favor of the latter position. In particular, it shows how to construct a mathematically rigorous theory for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, which is based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables. Though this theory is provably distinct from its quantum mechanical analog, it nonetheless reproduces central predictions of the latter. Further work may make an empirical comparison possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonabelianization map for conformal blocks, which relates $c=1$ Virasoro blocks on a Riemann surface $C$ to Heisenberg blocks on a branched double cover $\widetilde{C}$ of $C$. The nonabelianization map uses the datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro blocks in terms of fermion correlation functions determined by the Heisenberg block. The nonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop operators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new Kyiv-type formulas and regularized Fredholm determinant formulas for $\tau$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in miniaturized technology allows us to control physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of a previous work, provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions, corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. The control protocol and the time-dependent position distribution are qualitatively different from the corresponding overdamped limit: in particular, a symmetry of the boundary conditions, which is preserved in the absence of inertia, turns out to be broken in the underdamped regime. We also show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory, except close to the boundary, while the evolution of the position mean and of the second moments is highly non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Radial 3D Focusing Energy Critical INLS equations with defocusing perturbation: Ground states, Scattering, and Blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the following inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the radial regime, featuring a focusing energy-critical nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation: $$
  i\partial_t u +\Delta u =|x|^{-a} |u|^{p-2} u - |x|^{-b} |u|^{4-2b}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x^3, $$ where $0&lt;a$, $b&lt;2$ and $2+\frac{4-2a}{3}&lt; p\leq 6-2a$.
  First, we establish the existence and nonexistence of ground states, along with their quantitative properties. Subsequently, we analyze the dichotomy between scattering and blow-up for solutions with energy below the ground-state energy threshold.
  An intriguing feature of this equation is the lack of scaling invariance, which arises from the competing effects of the inhomogeneous nonlinearities. Additionally, the presence of singular weights breaks translation invariance in the spatial variable, introducing further complexity to the analysis.
  To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive study of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a leading-order focusing energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation. Our results provide new insights into the interplay between these competing nonlinearities and their influence on the dynamics of solutions.</description>

      <title>Difference Equations: from Berry Connections to the Coulomb Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated that a spectral variety for the Berry connection of a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSM with K\"ahler vacuum moduli space $X$ and abelian flavour symmetry is the support of a sheaf induced by a certain action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$. This action could be quantised to first-order matrix difference equations obeyed by brane amplitudes, and by taking the conformal limit, vortex partition functions. In this article, we elucidate how some of these results may be recovered from a 3d perspective, by placing the 2d theory at a boundary and gauging the flavour symmetry via a bulk A-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory (a sandwich construction). We interpret the above action as that of the bulk Coulomb branch algebra on boundary twisted chiral operators. This relates our work to recent constructions of actions of Coulomb branch algebras on quantum equivariant cohomology, providing a novel correspondence between these actions and spectral data of generalised periodic monopoles. The effective IR description of the 2d theory in terms of a twisted superpotential allows for explicit computations of these actions, which we demonstrate for abelian GLSMs.</description>

      <title>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Poisson Point Process, Coulomb Gas, and Vortex Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>

      <title>On the numerical integration of the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical force and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory aims to find an optimal protocol to steer a system between assigned boundary conditions while minimizing a given cost functional in finite time. Equations arising from these types of problems are often non-linear and difficult to solve numerically. In this note, we describe numerical methods of integration for two partial differential equations that commonly arise in optimal control theory: the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical potential for which we use Girsanov theorem; and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, or dynamic programming, equation for which we find the gradient of its solution using the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application of the numerical techniques to solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Generating Sets of Stochastic Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions 2 and 3 by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</description>

      <title>Near-critical and finite-size scaling for high-dimensional lattice trees and animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of lattice trees and lattice animals on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d$ above the upper critical dimension $d_{\mathrm c}=8$. We define a correlation length and prove that it diverges as $(p_c-p)^{-1/4}$ at the critical point $p_c$. Using this, we prove that the near-critical two-point function is bounded above by $C|x|^{-(d-2)}\exp[-c(p_c-p)^{1/4}|x|]$. We apply the near-critical bound to study lattice trees and lattice animals on a discrete $d$-dimensional torus (with $d &gt; d_{\mathrm c}$) of volume $V$. For $p_c-p$ of order $V^{-1/2}$, we prove that the torus susceptibility is of order $V^{1/4}$, and that the torus two-point function behaves as $|x|^{-(d-2)} + V^{-3/4}$ and thus has a plateau of size $V^{-3/4}$. The proofs require significant extensions of previous results obtained using the lace expansion.</description>

      <title>Statistics of invertible topological excitations: a framework using operators and many-body Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics, based on string operators and many-body Hilbert space, to invertible topological excitations of any dimensions. This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a rigorous and systematic theory for statistics independent to topological order and field theory. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for computing statistics, which has yielded results consistent with traditional physical theories.</description>

      <title>Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, probing a transverse $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_M$ background. Below the scale of the radius of $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, these theories resemble a circular quiver gauge theory with $M$ nodes of gauge group $U(N)$ and matter in the bifundamental representation (or adjoint in the case of $M=1$). In this paper, we study these LSTs in the presence of a surface defect, which is introduced through the action of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold that breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. This form allows us to argue that a number of non-perturbative symmetries, that have previously been established for the LSTs, are preserved in the presence of the defect. Furthermore, we discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function: focusing in detail on the case $(M,N)=(1,2)$, we analyse two distinct proposals made in the literature. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit, which we generalise to generic $(M,N)$. In view of the dualities of higher dimensional gauge theories to quantum many-body systems, we provide indications that our combinatoric expression for the defect partition are useful in constructing and analysing quantum integrable systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Property and Edge Universality of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the normalized adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with any fixed degree $d\geq 3$ and denote its eigenvalues as $\lambda_1=d/\sqrt{d-1}\geq \lambda_2\geq\lambda_3\cdots\geq \lambda_N$. We establish the following two results as $N\rightarrow \infty$. (i) With high probability, all eigenvalues are optimally rigid, up to an additional $N^{{\rm o}(1)}$ factor. Specifically, the fluctuations of bulk eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-1+{\rm o}(1)}$, and the fluctuations of edge eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-2/3+{\rm o}(1)}$. (ii) Edge universality holds for random $d$-regular graphs. That is, the distributions of $\lambda_2$ and $-\lambda_N$ converge to the Tracy-Widom$_1$ distribution associated with the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. As a consequence, for sufficiently large $N$, approximately $69\%$ of $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices are Ramanujan, meaning $\max\{\lambda_2,|\lambda_N|\}\leq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semisimplification of the full karoubian subcategory generated by the irreducible finite dimensional representations of the algebraic supergroup $GL(m|n)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. This semisimplification is equivalent to the representations of a pro-reductive group $H_{m|n}$. We show that there is a canonical decomposition $H_{m|n} \cong GL(m\!-\! n) \times H_{n|n}$, thereby reducing the determination of $H_{m|n}$ to the equal rank case $m\! =\! n$ which was treated in a previous paper.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>
