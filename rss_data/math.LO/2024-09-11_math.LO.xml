      <title>Building Models of Determinacy from Below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an $L$-like construction that produces the minimal model of $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}+$"$\Theta$ is regular". In fact, our construction can produce any model of $\mathsf{AD}^++\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}+V=L(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}))$ in which there is no hod mouse with a measurable limit of Woodins.</description>

      <title>Temporal Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) for every valued structure with the domain ${\mathbb Q}$ that is preserved by all order-preserving bijections. Such VCSPs will be called temporal, in analogy to the (classical) constraint satisfaction problem: a relational structure is preserved by all order-preserving bijections if and only if all its relations have a first-order definition in $({\mathbb Q};&lt;)$, and the CSPs for such structures are called temporal CSPs. Many optimization problems that have been studied intensively in the literature can be phrased as a temporal VCSP. We prove that a temporal VCSP is in P, or NP-complete. Our analysis uses the concept of fractional polymorphisms; this is the first dichotomy result for VCSPs over infinite domains which is complete in the sense that it treats all valued structures with a given automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Intermediate models and Kinna--Wagner Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinna--Wagner Principles state that every set can be mapped into some fixed iterated power set of an ordinal, and we write $\mathsf{KWP}$ to denote that there is some $\alpha$ for which this holds. The Kinna--Wagner Conjecture, formulated by the first author in [9], states that if $V$ is a model of $\mathsf{ZF+KWP}$ and $G$ is a $V$-generic filter, then whenever $W$ is an intermediate model of $\mathsf{ZF}$, that is $V\subseteq W\subseteq V[G]$, then $W=V(x)$ for some $x$ if and only if $W$ satisfies $\mathsf{KWP}$. In this work we prove the conjecture and generalise it even further. We include a brief historical overview of Kinna--Wagner Principles and new results about Kinna--Wagner Principles in the multiverse of sets.</description>

      <title>Schur ultrafilters and Bohr compactifications of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Schur ultrafilters on groups. Using the algebraic structure of Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications of discrete groups and Schur ultrafilters, we give a new description of Bohr compactifications of topological groups. This approach allows us to characterize chart groups that are topological groups. Namely, a chart group $G$ is a topological group if and only if each Schur ultrafilter on $G$ converges to the unit of $G$.</description>

      <title>Proof mining and probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theoretical framework of proof mining by establishing general logical metatheorems that allow for the extraction of the computational content of theorems with prima facie "non-computational" proofs from probability theory, thereby unlocking a major branch of mathematics as a new area of application for these methods. Concretely, we devise proof-theoretically tame logical systems that, for one, allow for the formalization of proofs involving algebras of sets together with probability contents as well as associated Lebesgue integrals on them and which, for another, are amenable to proof-theoretic metatheorems in the style of proof mining that guarantee the extractability of effective and tame bounds from large classes of ineffective existence proofs in probability theory. Moreover, these extractable bounds are guaranteed to be highly uniform in the sense that they will be independent of all parameters relating to the underlying probability space, particularly regarding events or measures of them. As such, these results, in particular, provide the first logical explanation for the success and the observed uniformities of the previous ad hoc case studies of proof mining in these areas and further illustrate their extent. Beyond these systems, we provide extensions for the proof-theoretically tame treatment of $\sigma$-algebras and associated probability measures using an intensional approach to infinite unions. Lastly, we establish a general proof-theoretic transfer principle that allows for the lift of quantitative information on a relationship between different modes of convergence for sequences of real numbers to sequences of random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every Polish group admits a non-trivial topological group automorphism. This answers a question posed by Forte Shinko. As a consequence, we prove that there are no uniquely homogeneous Polish groups.</description>

      <title>The Kaufmann--Clote question on end extensions of models of arithmetic and the weak regularity principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the end extendibility of models of arithmetic with restricted elementarity. By utilizing the restricted ultrapower construction in the second-order context, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any countable model of $\mathrm{B}\Sigma_{n+2}$, we construct a proper $\Sigma_{n+2}$-elementary end extension satisfying $\mathrm{B}\Sigma_{n+1}$, which answers a question by Clote positively. We also give a characterization of countable models of $\mathrm{I}\Sigma_{n+2}$ in terms of their end extendibility similar to the case of $\mathrm{B}\Sigma_{n+2}$. Along the proof, we will introduce a new type of regularity principles in arithmetic called the weak regularity principle, which serves as a bridge between the model's end extendibility and the amount of induction or collection it satisfies.</description>

      <title>Model theory of Hilbert spaces expanded by a representation of a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study expansions of infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces with a unitary representation of a group. When the group is finite, we prove the theory of the corresponding expansion is $\aleph_0$-categorical, $\aleph_0$-stable and is SFB. On the other hand, when the group involved is a product of the form $H\times \mathbb{Z}^n$, where $H$ is a finite group and $n\geq 1$, the theory of the Hilbert space expanded by the representation of this group is, in general, stable not $\aleph_0$-stable, not $\aleph_0$-categorical, but it is $\aleph_0$-categorical up to perturbations and $\aleph_0$-stable up to perturbations.</description>
