      <title>Note on Selection Bias in Observational Estimates of Algorithmic Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ho et. al (2024) is an interesting paper that attempts to estimate the degree of algorithmic progress from language models. They collect observational data on language models' loss and compute over time, and argue that as time has passed, language models' algorithmic efficiency has been rising. That is, the loss achieved for fixed compute has been dropping over time. In this note, I want to raise one potential methodological problem with the estimation strategy. Intuitively, if part of algorithmic quality is latent, and compute choices are endogenous to algorithmic quality, then resulting estimates of algorithmic quality will be biased.</description>

      <title>Banking 2.0: The Stablecoin Banking Revolution -- How Digital Assets Are Reshaping Global Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global financial system stands at an inflection point. Stablecoins represent the most significant evolution in banking since the abandonment of the gold standard, positioned to enable "Banking 2.0" by seamlessly integrating cryptocurrency innovation with traditional finance infrastructure. This transformation rivals artificial intelligence as the next major disruptor in the financial sector. Modern fiat currencies derive value entirely from institutional trust rather than physical backing, creating vulnerabilities that stablecoins address through enhanced stability, reduced fraud risk, and unified global transactions that transcend national boundaries. Recent developments demonstrate accelerating institutional adoption: landmark U.S. legislation including the GENIUS Act of 2025, strategic industry pivots from major players like JPMorgan's crypto-backed loan initiatives, and PayPal's comprehensive "Pay with Crypto" service. Widespread stablecoin implementation addresses critical macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the inflation-productivity gap plaguing modern monetary systems, through more robust and diversified backing mechanisms. Furthermore, stablecoins facilitate deregulation and efficiency gains, paving the way for a more interconnected international financial system. This whitepaper comprehensively explores how stablecoins are poised to reshape banking, supported by real-world examples, current market data, and analysis of their transformative potential.</description>
