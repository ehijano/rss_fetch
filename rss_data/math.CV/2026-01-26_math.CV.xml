      <title>A Non-Autonomous Model for Parabolic Implosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal polynomials appear naturally in the study of compositions of M\"obius transformations. In this paper, we consider several classes of orthogonal polynomials associated to non-autonomous perturbations of a parabolic M\"obius map. Our results can be viewed as instances of non-autonomous parabolic implosion, including a random perturbative regime in which convergence holds almost surely.</description>

      <title>$L^p$--$L^q$ estimates for Shimorin-type integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a positive measure on $[0,1]$. A Shimorin-type operator $T_\nu$ is an integral operator on the unit disk given by \[ T_\nu f(z) = \int_{\mathbb{D}} \frac{1}{1 - z\overline{\lambda}} \left( \int_0^1 \frac{d\nu(r)}{1 - r z \overline{\lambda}} \right) f(\lambda) \, dA(\lambda), \] which originates from Shimorin's work on Bergman-type kernel representations for logarithmically subharmonic weighted Bergman spaces.
  In this paper, we study $L^p$--$L^q$ estimates for $T_\nu$. Unlike classical Bergman-type operators, the critical line on the $(1/p,1/q)$-plane that separates the boundedness and unboundedness regions of $T_\nu$ is not immediately evident. Moreover, even along this line, new phenomena arise. In the present work, by introducing a quantity $c_\nu$, \begin{itemize}
  \item we first determine the critical boundary in the $(1/p,1/q)$-plane for bounded $T_\nu$;
  \item furthermore, on this critical line, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $T_\nu$ which have standard Bergman-type $L^p$--$L^q$ estimates, meaning that it is bounded in the interior of the region and admits weak-type and BMO-type estimates at endpoints. \end{itemize}</description>

      <title>Formal principle for line bundles on neighborhoods of an analytic subset of a compact K\"ahler manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formal principle for holomorphic line bundles on neighborhoods of an analytic subset of a complex manifold mainly in the case where it can be realized as an open subset of a compact K\"ahler manifold. Our approach identifies the obstruction as a global analytic class supported on a neighborhood of $Y$, and relates its vanishing to the solvability of a $\partial\overline{\partial}$-problem on neighborhoods of $Y$. As a consequence we obtain cohomological criteria ensuring the formal principle. We also construct a holomorphic family of compact K\"ahler surfaces containing a curve with topologically trivial normal bundle in which the formal principle holds for almost every fiber but fails for uncountably many fibers, exhibiting an instability phenomenon in families.</description>

      <title>Quasi Regular Functions in Quaternionic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new class of functions that arise naturally in quaternionic analysis, we call them "quasi regular functions". Like the well-known quaternionic regular functions, these functions provide representations of the quaternionic conformal group. However, unlike the regular functions, the quasi regular ones do not admit an invariant unitary structure but rather a pseudounitary equivalent. The reproducing kernels of these functions have an especially simple form: (Z-W)^{-1}. We describe the K-type bases of quasi regular functions and derive the reproducing kernel expansions. We also show that the restrictions of the irreducible representations formed from the quasi regular functions to the Poincare group have three irreducible components.
  Our interest in the quasi regular functions arises from an application to the study of conformal-invariant algebras of quaternionic functions. We also introduce a factorization of certain intertwining operators between tensor products of spaces of quaternionic functions. This factorization is obtained using fermionic Fock spaces constructed from the quasi regular functions.</description>

      <title>The H\"{o}rmander--Bernhardsson extremal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the function $\varphi$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$. Starting from the fact that $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ is an $\ell^2$ sequence, established in an earlier paper of ours, we identify $\varphi$ in the following way. We factor $\varphi(z)$ as $\Phi(z)\Phi(-z)$, where $\Phi(z)= \prod_{n=1}^\infty(1+(-1)^n\frac{z}{\tau_n})$ and show that $\Phi$ satisfies a certain second order linear differential equation along with a functional equation either of which characterizes $\Phi$. We use these facts to establish an odd power series expansion of $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ in terms of $(n+\frac12)^{-1}$ and a power series expansion of the Fourier transform of $\varphi$, as suggested by the numerical work of H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson. The dual characterization of $\Phi$ arises from a commutation relation that holds more generally for a two-parameter family of differential operators, a fact that is used to perform high precision numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions (basins/neighbourhoods of equilibria) in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for topological and geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors: First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time. Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in ["The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows", K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions. Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>
