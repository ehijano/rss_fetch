      <title>Exploring the Feasibility of Employing a Hybrid Machine Learning Method to Unpack Student Reasoning Patterns in Physics Essays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel clustering pipeline that combines two classic clustering algorithms to better understand student problem-solving strategies. This unsupervised machine learning method helps uncover patterns in reasoning without pre-defined labels. We applied it to essays written for an online multiple-choice quiz, the resulting clusters showed strong statistical alignment with students' selected answers. We also report on the resulting clusters of the hybrid pipeline compared to that of K-Means (MacQueen, 1967) and Hierarchal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (HDBSCAN) (McInnes, Healy, and Astels, 2017) by analyzing the Scatter Plots, Silhouette Scores (Rousseeuw, 1987), and Davies Bouldin Index (Davies and Bouldin, 1979).</description>

      <title>Assessing Physics Students' Scientific Argumentation using Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific argumentation is an important science and engineering practice and a necessary 21st Century workforce skill. Due to the nature of large enrollment classes, it is difficult to individually assess students and provide feedback on their argumentation. The recent developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) may provide a solution. In this study we investigate methods using NLP and ML to assess and understand students' argumentation. Specifically, we investigate the use of topic modeling to analyze student essays of argumentation after solving a problem in the recitation section of an introductory calculus-based physics course four semesters. We report on the emergent themes present in each semester.</description>

      <title>High stakes exams inflate gender gap thus leading to systematic grading errors in introductory physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has suggested that changing the percentage of the course grade associated with exam grades in STEM courses can change the gender gap in the course. It's also been shown that assessments with the highest stakes have the lowest (relative) scores for female students. Previous research by the authors has shown that the implementation of retake exams can eliminate the gender gap in introductory physics courses. This paper explores several different hypotheses for why retake exams are associated with a zeroed gender gap. Analyzing data from exams with different stakes, we argue that the entire gender gap on introductory physics exams may be due to the stakes associated with those exams. In other words, the data support the idea that a gender grade-gap on exams is not measuring a gender difference in the physics knowledge or physics ability of these students.</description>

      <title>A simulation-heuristics dual-process model for intuitive physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of mental simulation in human physical reasoning is widely acknowledged, but whether it is employed across scenarios with varying simulation costs and where its boundary lies remains unclear. Using a pouring-marble task, our human study revealed two distinct error patterns when predicting pouring angles, differentiated by simulation time. While mental simulation accurately captured human judgments in simpler scenarios, a linear heuristic model better matched human predictions when simulation time exceeded a certain boundary. Motivated by these observations, we propose a dual-process framework, Simulation-Heuristics Model (SHM), where intuitive physics employs simulation for short-time simulation but switches to heuristics when simulation becomes costly. By integrating computational methods previously viewed as separate into a unified model, SHM quantitatively captures their switching mechanism. The SHM aligns more precisely with human behavior and demonstrates consistent predictive performance across diverse scenarios, advancing our understanding of the adaptive nature of intuitive physical reasoning.</description>

      <title>NotebookLM: An LLM with RAG for active learning and collaborative tutoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores NotebookLM, a Google Gemini powered AI platform that integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as a collaborative physics tutor, an area of research that is developing quickly. In our implementation, NotebookLM was configured as an AI physics collaborative tutor to support students in solving conceptually oriented physics problems using a collaborative, Socratic approach. When deployed as a collaborative tutor, the system restricts student interaction to a chat only interface, promoting controlled and guided engagement. By grounding its responses in teacher provided source documents, NotebookLM helps mitigate one of the major shortcomings of standard large language models--hallucinations--thereby ensuring more traceable and reliable answers. Our experiments demonstrate NotebookLM's potential as a low cost, easily implemented RAG based tool for personalized and traceable AI assisted physics learning in diverse educational settings. Furthermore, NotebookLM also functions as a valuable study tool for both teachers and students by generating targeted questions, study guides, and supplementary materials that enhance both classroom instruction and independent research. While limitations remain, particularly regarding legal restrictions, the current text only mode of interaction, and the intrinsic reliability challenges of statistical models, this work presents a promising example of a grounded AI application in physics education.</description>

      <title>Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a didactic proposal on Rutherford's gold foil experiment, tailored for high schools. Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the activity introduces key concepts of modern physics-often absent from standard curricula-through a hands on, inquiry-based approach. By employing analogical reasoning and black box modeling, students engage in experimental investigation and collaborative problem-solving to explore atomic structure. The activity was implemented as a case study with a class of first-year students (aged 14-15) from a applied science-focused secondary school in Italy. Data collection combined qualitative observations, structured discussions, and digital feedback tools to assess conceptual learning and student engagement. Findings indicate that well-designed, student-centered interventions can meaningfully support the development of abstract scientific understanding, while fostering critical thinking and collaborative skills.</description>

      <title>Online Advanced Labs in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At Arizona State University we have built the first and only fully online Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, with a complete curriculum, including labs. The upper division Advanced Lab courses present a special challenge for online delivery. We address that using a set of custom-built simulator modules that replicate all the imperfections (noise, background, etc) inherent in real-world data. The set of experiments duplicates those of the in-person classes. In this paper, we present an overview of these labs and discuss the advantages and challenges of delivering them online. We assert that these labs provide a valid and rigorous component for the fully online degree. The entire set of labs is available as Open Source Supplemental Materials and is shared for others to use in part or in whole, with suitable attribution.</description>

      <title>Exploring utilization of generative AI for research and education in data-driven materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has recently had a profound impact on various fields, including daily life, research, and education. To explore its efficient utilization in data-driven materials science, we organized a hackathon -- AIMHack2024 -- in July 2024. In this hackathon, researchers from fields such as materials science, information science, bioinformatics, and condensed matter physics worked together to explore how generative AI can facilitate research and education. Based on the results of the hackathon, this paper presents topics related to (1) conducting AI-assisted software trials, (2) building AI tutors for software, and (3) developing GUI applications for software. While generative AI continues to evolve rapidly, this paper provides an early record of its application in data-driven materials science and highlights strategies for integrating AI into research and education.</description>

      <title>Three-body problem for nuclear physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A brief excursion into the three-body problem is presented for graduate students in nuclear physics or anyone at a similar stage. Starting from single-particle coordinates, a step-by-step derivation of the Shcr\"{o}dinger equation in Jacobi coordinates is outlined. Laplace operators are explicitly transformed through the chain rule for multivariable calculus. The transformation of Faddeev equations from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates is elaborated upon. In all transformations (from single-particle coordinates to Jacobi coordinates, rotation between Jacobi coordinates and from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates) the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is computed to show how volume elements transform. The projection of Faddeev equations on a hyperspherical harmonics basis is explicitly carried out to obtain the coupled hyperradial equations that define the hyperspherical harmonics method.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to measure evidence of students' sensemaking in physics courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the education system, problem-solving correctness is often inappropriately conflated with student learning. Advances in both Physics Education Research (PER) and Machine Learning (ML) provide the initial tools to develop a more meaningful and efficient measurement scheme for whether physics students are engaging in sensemaking: a learning process of figuring out the how and why for a particular phenomena. In this work, we contribute such a measurement scheme, which quantifies the evidence of students' physical sensemaking given their written explanations for their solutions to physics problems. We outline how the proposed human annotation scheme can be automated into a deployable ML model using language encoders and shared probabilistic classifiers. The procedure is scalable for a large number of problems and students. We implement three unique language encoders with logistic regression, and provide a deployability analysis on 385 real student explanations from the 2023 Introduction to Physics course at Tufts University. Furthermore, we compute sensemaking scores for all students, and analyze these measurements alongside their corresponding problem-solving accuracies. We find no linear relationship between these two variables, supporting the hypothesis that one is not a reliable proxy for the other. We discuss how sensemaking scores can be used alongside problem-solving accuracies to provide a more nuanced snapshot of student performance in physics class.</description>
