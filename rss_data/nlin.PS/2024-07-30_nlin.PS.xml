      <title>Global Bifurcations in a Damped-Driven Diatomic Granular Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit here the dynamics of an engineered dimer granular crystal under an external periodic drive in the presence of dissipation. Earlier findings included a saddle-node bifurcation, whose terminal point initiated the observation of chaos; the system was found to exhibit bistability and potential quasiperiodicity. We now complement these findings by the identification of unstable manifolds of saddle periodic solutions (saddle points of the stroboscopic map) within the system dynamics. We unravel how homoclinic tangles of these manifolds lead to the appearance of a chaotic attractor, upon the apparent period-doubling bifurcations that destroy invariant tori associated with quasiperiodicity. These findings complement the earlier ones, offering more concrete insights into the emergence of chaos within this high-dimensional, experimentally accessible system.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional solitons supported by the spin-orbit coupling and Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in PT-symmetric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited states (ESs) of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons of the semivortex (SV) and mixed-mode (MM) types, supported by the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and local nonlinearity in binary Bose-Einstein condensates, are unstable, on the contrary to the stability of the SV and MM solitons in their fundamental states. We propose a stabilization strategy for these states in 3D, combining SOC and long-range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions (RRI), in the presence of a spatially-periodic potential, that may include a parity-time (PT)-symmetric component. ESs of the SV solitons, which carry integer vorticities S and S+1 in their two components, exhibit robustness up to S= 4. ESs of MM solitons feature an interwoven necklace-like structure, with the components carrying opposite fractional values of the orbital angular momentum. Regions of the effective stability of the 3D solitons of the SV and MM types (both fundamental ones and ESs), are identified as functions of the imaginary component of the PT-symmetric potential and strengths of the SOC and RRI terms.</description>

      <title>Synthetic monopole with half-integer magnetic charge in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to create monopoles with half-integer magnetic charges in a spinful cold atom system. With a minimal monopole in the center, we derive the ground-state single-vortex wave function on the sphere and develop the vortex's kinematic equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. The vortex's trajectory is generally depicted by the precession of the system. We further formulate the inter-vortex interaction and build up a theory of multi-vortex dynamics in high-charge monopole systems. We predict the vortices'trajectory in the bi-vortex system and figure out stable vortex (line) patterns in multi-vortex systems. Our study provides deep insights into properties of magnetic monopoles and vortices and paves the way for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Dimers and discrete breathers in Bose-Einstein condensates in a quasi-periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into a quasi-periodic potential created by two sub-lattices of comparable amplitudes and incommensurate periods is considered. Although the conventional tight-binding approximation is not applicable in this setting, the description can still be reduced to a discrete model that accounts for the modes below the mobility edge. In the respective discrete lattice, where no linear hopping exists, solutions and their dynamics are governed solely by nonlinear interactions. Families of nonlinear modes, including those with no linear limit, are described with a special focus on dimers, which correspond to breather solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a quasi-periodic potential. The breathers are found to be stable for negative scattering lengths. Localization and stable propagation of breathers are also observed for positive scattering lengths at relatively weak and moderate nonlinearities.</description>
