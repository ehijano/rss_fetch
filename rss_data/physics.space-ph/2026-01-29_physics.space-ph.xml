      <title>$1/f$ Noise in Synthetic and Solar Wind Data: Superposition Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplanetary magnetic field exhibits a distinctive $1/f$ spectral density from frequencies of around $\unit[10^{-6}]{Hz}$ to around $\unit[10^{-4}]{Hz}$, ranging from harmonics of the solar rotation to the reciprocal of the turbulence correlation time in the spacecraft frame. Various theories have been proposed to explain its origin, typically invoking either processes in the lower corona or in the solar interior, or local interplanetary dynamics. Here, we investigate the {\it superposition principle} that underlies explanations of the solar/coronal types, which in principle can generate the full observed range of $1/f$ noise. Using synthetic time series with scale-invariant or log-normal distributions of correlation times, we examine the efficacy of several superposition approaches in generating a $1/f$ regime. The persistence of $1/f$ spectrum is further illustrated with decade-long {\it in situ} magnetic field measurements from the ACE spacecraft. Together, these results help explain the ubiquity of $1/f$ noise under the unavoidable superposition inherent in long-duration heliospheric data.</description>

      <title>Sunward Streaming 3He-rich SEP Events Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe during Perihelion Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on two 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by Solar Orbiter (SO) and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the April 1 - 4, 2024 conjunction when both spacecraft are within 0.3 AU near their respective perihelion passage. The two 3He-rich SEP events, originating from active region (AR) 13615, exhibit two key anomalies: (1) sunward streaming SEPs and (2) SEP travel path lengths exceeding 2 - 8 times the nominal Parker spiral expectations. Remote observations suggest these SEPs have been redirected by a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) that also originated from AR 13615 two days prior on March 30, 2024 at 21:04 UT. Using the near-Sun CME speed and width measurements, we estimate its size and location at the onset time of the first 3He-rich SEP event. Based on our estimates, SEPs propagating around the ICME front have travelled between 0.76 - 0.95 AU when they arrive at SO, increasing to 0.94 - 1.1 AU at PSP, consistent with our observed SEP arrival times. These findings constitute the first multi-spacecraft observation of sunward streaming 3He-rich SEPs. We discuss the implications of this phenomenon on 3He-rich seed material and the rare widespread 3He-rich SEP events (see Section 5.4).</description>

      <title>Loading non-Maxwellian Velocity Distributions in Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical procedures for generating non-Maxwellian velocity distributions in particle simulations are presented. First, Monte Carlo methods for an $(r,q)$ distribution that generalizes flattop and kappa distributions are discussed. Then, two rejection methods for the regularized kappa distribution are presented, followed by a comparison in the $\kappa$ space. A simple recipe is proposed for the subtracted kappa distribution. Properties and numerical recipes for the ring and shell distributions with a finite Gaussian width are discussed. The ring and shell Maxwellians are further introduced as alternatives to the ring and shell distributions. Finally, methods for the super-Gaussian and the filled-shell distributions are presented.</description>
