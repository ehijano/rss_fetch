      <title>On defect in finite extensions of valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, the defect of finite extensions of valued fields has emerged as the main obstacle in several fundamental problems in algebraic geometry such as the local uniformization problem. Hence, it is important to identify defectless fields and study properties related to defect. In this paper we study the relations between the following properties of valued fields: simply defectless, immediate-defectless and algebraically maximal. The main result of the paper is an example of an algebraically maximal field that admits a simple defect extension. For this, we introduce the notion of quasi-finite elements in the generalized power series field $k\left(\left(t^\Gamma\right)\right)$.</description>

      <title>The Betti Numbers of Kunz-Waldi Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two coprime numbers $p&lt;q$, KW semigroups contain $p,q$ and are contained in $\langle p,q,r \rangle$ where $2r= p,q, p+q$ whichever is even. These semigroups were first introduced by Kunz and Waldi. Kunz and Waldi proved that all $KW$ semigroups of embedding dimension $n\geq 4$ have Cohen-Macaulay type $n-1$ and first Betti number ${n \choose 2}$. In this paper, we characterize KW semigroups whose defining ideal is generated by the $2\times 2$ minors of a $2\times n$ matrix. In addition, we identify all KW semigroups that lie on the interior of the same face of the Kunz cone $\mathcal C_p$ as a KW semigroup with determinantal defining ideal. Thus, we provide an explicit formula for the Betti numbers of all those KW semigroups.</description>

      <title>Kato-Milne cohomology group over rational function fields in characteristic 2, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let F be a field of characteristic 2. In this paper we determine the Kato-Milne cohomology of the rational function field F(x) in one variable x. This will be done by proving an analogue of the Milnor exact sequence [4] in the setting of Kato-Milne cohomology. As an application, we answer the open case of the norm theorem for Kato-Milne cohomology that concerns separable irreducible polynomials in many variables. This completes a result of Mukhija [17, Theorem A.3] that gives the norm theorem for inseparable polynomials.</description>

      <title>Preserving Lefschetz properties after extension of variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a standard graded artinian $k$-algebra $B$ and an extension of $B$ by a new variable, $A=B\otimes_k k[x]/(x^d)$ for some $d\geq 1$. We will show how maximal rank properties for powers of a general linear form on $A$ can be determined by maximal rank properties for different powers of general linear forms on $B$. This is then used to study Lefschetz properties of algebras that can be obtained via such extensions. In particular, it allows for a new proof that monomial complete intersections have the strong Lefschetz property over a field of characteristic zero. Moreover, it gives a recursive formula for the determinants that show up in that case. Finally, for algebras over a field of characteristic zero, we give a classification for what properties $B$ must have for all extensions $B\otimes_k k[x]/(x^d)$ to have the weak or the strong Lefschetz property.</description>

      <title>Odd and even derivations, transposed Poisson superalgebra and 3-Lie superalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One important example of a transposed Poisson algebra can be constructed by means of a commutative algebra and its derivation. This approach can be extended to superalgebras, that is, one can construct a transposed Poisson superalgebra given a commutative superalgebra and its even derivation. In this paper we show that including odd derivations in the framework of this approach requires introducing a new notion. It is a super vector space with two operations that satisfy the compatibility condition of transposed Poisson superalgebra. The first operation is determined by a left supermodule over commutative superalgebra and the second is a Jordan bracket. Then it is proved that the super vector space generated by an odd derivation of a commutative superalgebra satisfies all the requirements of introduced notion. We also show how to construct a 3-Lie superalgebra if we are given a transposed Poisson superalgebra and its even derivation.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Castelnuovo-Mumford Regularity of Binomial Edge Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the introduction of binomial edge ideals $J_{G}$ by Herzog et al. and independently Ohtani, there has been significant interest in relating algebraic invariants of the binomial edge ideal with combinatorial invariants of the underlying graph $G$. Here, we take up a question considered by Herzog and Rinaldo regarding Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of block graphs. To this end, we introduce a new invariant $\nu(G)$ associated to any simple graph $G$, defined as the maximal total length of a certain collection of induced paths within $G$ subject to conditions on the induced subgraph. We prove that for any graph $G$, $\nu(G) \leq \text{reg}(J_{G})-1$, and that the length of a longest induced path of $G$ is less than or equal to $\nu(G)$; this refines an inequality of Matsuda and Murai. We then investigate the question: when is $\nu(G) = \text{reg}(J_{G})-1$? We prove that equality holds when $G$ is closed; this gives a new characterization of a result of Ene and Zarojanu, and when $G$ is bipartite and $J_{G}$ is Cohen-Macaulay; this gives a new characterization of a result of Jayanathan and Kumar. For a block graph $G$, we prove that $\nu(G)$ admits a combinatorial characterization independent of any auxiliary choices, and we prove that $\nu(G) = \text{reg}(J_{G})-1$. This gives $\text{reg}(J_{G})$ a combinatorial interpretation for block graphs, and thus answers the question of Herzog and Rinaldo.</description>

      <title>The Scarf complex of squarefree powers, symbolic powers of edge ideals, and cover ideals of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every monomial ideal $I$ has a Scarf complex, which is a subcomplex of its minimal free resolution. We say that $I$ is Scarf if its Scarf complex is also its minimal free resolution. In this paper, we fully characterize all pairs $(G,n)$ of a graph $G$ and an integer $n$ such that the squarefree power $I(G)^{[n]}$ or the symbolic power $I(G)^{(n)}$ of the edge ideal $I(G)$ is Scarf. We also determine all graphs $G$ such that its cover ideal $J(G)$ is Scarf, with an explicit description when $G$ is either chordal or bipartite.</description>
