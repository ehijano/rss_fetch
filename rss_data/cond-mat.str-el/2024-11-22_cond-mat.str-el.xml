      <title>Predicting interacting Green's functions with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials exhibit complex electronic phenomena that are challenging to capture with traditional theoretical methods, yet understanding these systems is crucial for discovering new quantum materials. Addressing the computational bottlenecks in studying such systems, we present a proof-of-concept machine learning-based approach to accelerate Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) calculations. Our method predicts interacting Green's functions on arbitrary two-dimensional lattices using a two-step ML framework. First, an autoencoder-based network learns and generates physically plausible band structures of materials, providing diverse training data. Next, a dense neural network predicts interacting Green's functions of these physically-possible band structures, expressed in the basis of Legendre polynomials. We demonstrate that this architecture can serve as a substitute for the computationally demanding quantum impurity solver in DMFT, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This approach offers a scalable pathway to accelerate simulations of strongly correlated systems and lays the groundwork for future extensions to multi-band systems.</description>

      <title>CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a unique Co-antiferromagnetic topological heavy-fermion system with $P\cdot\mathcal{T}$-protected Kondo effect and nodal-line excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on high-throughput screening and experimental data, we find that CeCo$_2$P$_2$ is unique in heavy-fermion materials: it has a Kondo effect at a high temperature which is nonetheless below a Co-antiferromagnetic ordering temperature. This begs the question: how is the Kondo singlet formed? All other magnetic Kondo materials do not first form magnetism on the atoms whose electrons are supposed to screen the local moments. We theoretically explain these observations and show the multifaceted uniqueness of CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a playground for Kondo, magnetism, flat band, and topological physics. At high temperatures, the itinerant Co $c$ electrons of the system form non-atomic bands with a narrow bandwidth, leading to a high antiferromagnetic transition temperature. We show that the quantum geometry of the bands promotes in-plane ferromagnetism, while the weak dispersion along the $z$ direction facilitates out-of-plane antiferromagnetism. At low temperatures, we uncover a novel phase that manifests the coexistence of Co-antiferromagnetism and the Kondo effect, linked to the $P\cdot \mathcal{T}$-protected Kramers' doublets and the filling-enforced metallic nature of $c$ electrons in the antiferromagnetic phase. Subsequently, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in cooperation with glide-mirror-$z$ symmetry, creates nodal-line excitation near the Fermi energy. Our results emphasize the importance of lattice symmetry and quantum geometry, Kondo physics, and magnetism in the understanding of the correlation physics of this unique compound. We also test our theory on the structurally similar compound LaCo$_2$P$_2$ and show how we are able to understand its vastly different phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge dynamics in bilayer electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron system in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major point is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice structure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the electron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron density. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the random phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering tendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-} modes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight distribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The spectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the q_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum q_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no spectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight at q_{z}c=2n pi with n \ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0). When q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When the intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+}) mode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the gap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into account, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes are gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also clarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong electron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures available data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Certain BCS wavefunctions are quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a method for constructing many-body scar states in fermionic lattice models that incorporate a given type of correlations with one of the states maximizing them over the full Hilbert space. Therefore this state may always be made the ground state by adding such correlations as a "pairing potential" $\delta H_0$ to any Hamiltonian $H=H_0+OT$ supporting group-invariant scars [arXiv:2007.00845]. In case of single-flavour spin-full fermions the ground state is a special case of the BCS wavefunction written in real space and invariant under any site index relabelling. For multi-orbital fermions this state also resembles BCS but includes higher order terms corresponding to "pairing" of more than two fermions. The broad class of eligible Hamiltonians $H$ is well documented [arXiv:2007.00845],[arXiv:2106.10300] and includes many conventional condensed matter interactions. The part of the Hamiltonian $(H_0+\delta H_0)$ that governs the exact dynamics of the scar subspace coincides with the BCS mean-field Hamiltonian. We therefore show that its BCS ground state and the excitations above it are many-body scars that are dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space and thereby protected from thermalization. These states are insensitive to a variety of $OT$ Hamiltonian terms that among others include interactions and (spin-orbit) hoppings. Our results point out a connection between the fields of superconductivity and weak ergodicity breaking (many-body scars) and will hopefully encourage further investigations. They also provide the first practical protocol to initialize a fermionic system to a scar state in (a quantum simulator) experiment.</description>

      <title>The Gr\"uneisen parameter applied to critical phenomena and experimental investigations of correlated phenomena in molecular conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Ph.D. Thesis, a systematic review is performed on the derivation and generalization of the Gr\"uneisen parameter followed by its unprecedented applications to several distinct scenarios, such as magnetic model systems, zero-field quantum phase transitions, the maximization of caloric effects close to any critical-end point based on entropy arguments, the here-proposed adiabatic magnetization of a paramagnetic salt, as well as for Cosmology in the frame of the universe expansion. Since this Ph.D. Thesis is a symbiosis between theoretical and experimental results, an experimental investigation of correlated phenomena was carried out for molecular conductors of the (TMTTF)$_2$X family, where TMTTF is the base molecule tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and X a monovalent counter-anion such as PF$_6$, SbF$_6$, or AsF$_6$. Such strongly correlated electron systems are considered suitable ones for the exploration of Mott insulating phase, charge-ordering, spin-Peierls, and superconductivity. In particular, the investigation of a possible multiferroic character in these salts was performed via quasi-static (low-frequency) dielectric constant $\varepsilon'$ measurements as a function of temperature where a maximum in $\varepsilon'$ as a function of temperature was observed at the corresponding charge-ordering temperature for both hydrogenated and 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$SbF$_6$ salts. Furthermore, Raman measurements were performed on the 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, showing a possible magneto-optical effect on the $\nu_4(a_g)$ vibrational mode of the TMTTF molecule. Yet, fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the fully-hydrogenated (TMTTF)$_2$AsF$_6$ presents an expressive fluorescence background, which is roughly five orders of magnitude lower than that for the 97.5% deuterated variant of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Antiferromagnetic Topological Nodal-line Kondo Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symbiosis of strong interactions, flat bands, topology and symmetry has led to the discovery of exotic phases of matter, including fractional Chern insulators, correlated moir\'e topological superconductors, and Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Correlated metals, such as those present in Kondo lattices, rely on the screening of local moments by a sea of non-magnetic conduction electrons. Here, we report on a unique topological Kondo lattice compound, CeCo2P2, where the Kondo effect - whose existence under the magnetic Co phase is protected by PT symmetry - coexists with antiferromagnetic order emerging from the flat bands associated with the Co atoms. Remarkably, this is the only known Kondo lattice compound where magnetic order occurs in non-heavy electrons, and puzzlingly, at a temperature significantly higher than that of the Kondo effect. Furthermore, at low temperatures, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in conjunction with a glide-mirror-z symmetry, results in a nodal line protected by bulk topology near the Fermi energy. These unusual properties, arising from the interplay between itinerant and correlated electrons from different constituent elements, lead to novel quantum phases beyond the celebrated topological Kondo insulators and Weyl Kondo semimetals. CeCo2P2 thus provides an ideal platform for investigating narrow bands, topology, magnetism, and the Kondo effect in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of electron-electron correlated to electron-phonon coupled phase progression in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trilayer nickelates are a rich class of materials exhibiting diverse correlated phenomena, including superconductivity, density wave transitions, non-Fermi liquid behavior along with an unusual metal-to-metal transition around T* ~ 150 K. Understanding the electronic correlations, lattice and charge dynamics are crucial to unreveal the origin of superconductivity and other instabilities in nickelates. Our in-depth Raman measurements shows that trilayer nickelate, La4Ni3O10, shows transition from electron-phonon coupled phase to the electron-electron correlated one below charge density wave transition around T* with an estimated energy gap of ~ 18-20 meV. The transition around T* is also accompanied by the emergence of zone folded phonon modes reflecting the transition into the charge density wave phase. Phonon modes self-energy parameters show anomalous changes around T* attributed to the electron-electron correlations, and renormalization rate of the phonon modes is much slower in the charge-ordered phase compared to the phase above T*. The transition around T* are marked by the suppression of electron-phonon coupling parameter by ~ 70 %, a change of the quasiparticle dynamics from non-Fermi liquid to the Landau-Fermi liquid type behaviour estimated using the low frequency Raman response.</description>

      <title>Dirac and chiral spin liquids on spin-1/2 square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the challenging problem of identifying the quantum spin liquid candidate in the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.</description>

      <title>Ground-state magnetic structures of topological kagome metals RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome metals have attracted tremendous research interests recently, because they represent an ideal playground for exploring the fascinating interplay between their intrinsically inherited topologically non-trivial electron band structures, magnetism and electronic correlation effects, and the resultant novel electronic/magnetic states and emergent excitations. In this work, we report a comprehensive single-crystal neutron diffraction investigation of the ground-state magnetic structures of the recently discovered V-based topological kagome metals RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er). Furthermore, the sample synthesis details and our systematic studies of crystal structure, low-temperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties of these compounds via various in-house characterization techniques are also reported. It can be revealed that RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho) have a collinear ferromagnetic order in the ground state, with the ordered magnetic moment aligned along the c axis for R = Tb, Ho, while approximately 20${^\circ}$ tilted off from the c axis for R = Dy. In contrast, ErV$_6$Sn$_6$ shows an A-type antiferromagnetic structure with a magnetic propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.5), and with the ordered magnetic moment aligned in the ab plane. A comparison of the low-temperature magnetic structures for both the extensively investigated topological kagome metal series of RV$_6$Sn$_6$ and RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is given in details. This allows to gain new insights into the complex magnetic interactions, diverse single-ion magnetic anisotropies and spin dynamics in these compounds. The reported ground-state magnetic structures in RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) can pave the way for further explorations of the possible interplay between magnetism and topologically non-trivial electron band structures in the magnetically ordered phase regime.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to the dynamics of dissipative quantum impurity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic "reverse conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering in Ising Field Theory using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering in Ising Field Theory (IFT) using matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. IFT is a one-parameter family of strongly coupled non-integrable quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions, interpolating between massive free fermion theory and Zamolodchikov's integrable massive $E_8$ theory. Particles in IFT may scatter either elastically or inelastically. In the post-collision wavefunction, particle tracks from all final-state channels occur in superposition; processes of interest can be isolated by projecting the wavefunction onto definite particle sectors, or by evaluating energy density correlation functions. Using numerical simulations we determine the time delay of elastic scattering and the probability of inelastic particle production as a function of collision energy. We also study the mass and width of the lightest resonance near the $E_8$ point in detail. Close to both the free fermion and $E_8$ theories, our results for both elastic and inelastic scattering are in good agreement with expectations from form-factor perturbation theory. Using numerical computations to go beyond the regime accessible by perturbation theory, we find that the high energy behavior of the two-to-two particle scattering probability in IFT is consistent with a conjecture of Zamolodchikov. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of tensor-network methods for simulating the real-time dynamics of strongly coupled quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch self-energy of dissipative interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the phenomenon of exponential localization of single-particle eigenstates near the boundary of the system. We explore its generalization to the many-body regime by investigating interacting fermions in open quantum systems. Therein, the elementary excitations from the ``vacuum'' (steady state) are given by two types of dissipative quasi-particles composed of single-fermion operators. We perturbatively calculate the self-energy of these quasi-particles in the presence of interactions, and utilize the non-Bloch band theory to develop an exact integral formula, which is further simplified by imposing complex momentum conservation. The formula allows calculating the Liouvillian gap modified by interactions with high precision, as demonstrated by comparison to numerical results. Furthermore, our results show that interactions can even enhance the non-reciprocity of fermion hoppings, contrary to the conventional viewpoint from the Pauli exclusion principle. Our formulation provides a quantitative tool for investigating dissipative interacting fermions with non-Hermitian skin effect, and generalizes the Fermi liquid theory to open quantum systems in the context of diagrammatic perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>A critical state under weak measurement is not critical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical systems host nontrivial entanglement structure that is generally sensitive to additional couplings. In the present work, we study the effect of weak measurements on the entanglement Hamiltonian of massless free fermions which are prepared in their critical ground state. While the power-law decaying correlation and logarithmic growing entanglement entropy have been observed as typical signatures of quantum criticality after the weak measurement, in this work we show that the conformal symmetry is lost and the entanglement Hamiltonian generally becomes gapped for arbitrary small measurement strength. To reveal this unconventional entanglement structure, we consider a field-theory description that allows us to establish an analytic mapping between the entanglement Hamiltonians before and after the weak measurements. From this mapping, we find that although the measurements lead to a significant modification of the entanglement spectrum, the real-space distribution of the eigenfunction of the kernel of entanglement Hamiltonian is unchanged, which is responsible for the coexistence of a gapped entanglement Hamiltonian and the logarithmic entanglement entropy. Moreover, as the mapping works for arbitrarily many disjoint intervals, the multi-interval entanglement entropy also exhibits the same scaling behavior as the critical ground state, and shares the same effective central charge with the single-interval case. We numerically demonstrate these field-theory results on a lattice model, where the entanglement Hamiltonian after weak measurements exhibits the typical signature of a finite gap and becomes long-ranged even in the single-interval case. This is distinct from the critical ground state, where the entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval is gapless and local.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality in tellurium derives from a Peierls distortion driven by strong electron-phonon coupling, making this material a unique candidate for observing a light-induced topological phase transition. By using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES), we reveal that upon near-infrared photoexcitation the Peierls gap is modulated by displacively excited coherent phonons with $\mathrm{A_{1g}}$ symmetry as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking $\mathrm{E'_{LO}}$ modes. By comparison with state-of-the-art TDDFT+U calculations, we reveal the microscopic origin of the in-phase oscillations of band edges, due to phonon-induced modulation of the effective Hubbard $U$ term.</description>

      <title>Promoting and imaging intervalley coherent order in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene on MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer rhombohedral graphene (RG) has recently emerged as a new, structurally simple flat-band system, which facilitates the exploration of interaction-driven correlation states with highly ordered electron arrangements. Despite a variety of many-body order behaviors observed in RG by transport measurements, the direct microscopic visualization of such correlated phases in real space is still lacking. Here, we show the discovery of a robust intervalley coherent order, a long-predicted ground state in RG, at 77 K in tetralayer RG placed on MoS2 via imaging atomic-scale spatial reconstruction of wave functions for correlated states. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we observe spectroscopic signatures of electronic correlations at partially filled flat bands, where distinct splitting appears. At ~60% and ~70% fillings of the flat bands, we visualize atomic-scale reconstruction patterns with a &lt;sqrt&gt;3 x &lt;sqrt&gt;3 supercell on graphene lattice at liquid nitrogen temperature, which indicates a robust intervalley coherent phase of the interacting electrons. The &lt;sqrt&gt;3 x &lt;sqrt&gt;3 pattern is observed in MoS2-supported RG, while it is absent in hBN-based ones under the same experimental conditions, suggesting the significant influence of spin-orbit proximity effect. Our results provide microscopic insights into the correlated phases in tetralayer RG and highlight the significant potential for realizing highly accessible collective phenomena through Van der Waals proximity.</description>

      <title>Interplay of symmetry breaking and deconfinement in 3D quantum vertex models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a broad class of frustration-free quantum vertex models in 3+1D whose ground states are weighted superpositions of classical 3D vertex model configurations. Our results are illustrated for diamond, cubic, and BCC lattices, but hold for general 3D lattices with even coordination number. The corresponding classical vertex models have a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge constraint enriched with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ global symmetry. We study the interplay between these symmetries by exploiting exact wavefunction dualities and effective field theories. We find an exact gapless point which by duality is related to the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point of $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids. At this point, both the symmetry breaking and deconfinement order parameters exhibit long range order. The gapless point is additionally a self-dual point of a second duality that maps the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ deconfined and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken phases to one another. For the BCC lattice vertex model, we find that gapless point is proximate to an unusual intermediate phase where symmetry breaking and deconfinement coexist.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and composite excitations of antiferromagnetic spin trimer chains in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies of the high-energy excitations on an antiferromagnetic trimer chain, we numerically investigate the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics in this system by applying a magnetic field. The numerical methods we used include the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle, and cluster perturbation theory. From calculating the entanglement entropy, we have revealed the phase diagram which includes the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II, and ferromagnetic phases. Both the critical XY-I and XY-II phases are characterized by the conformal field theory with a central charge $c \simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamic spin structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime with weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagating of doublons and quartons, respectively. Notably, applying a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectrum into two branches, labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we explore the spin dynamics of a frustrated trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}. In the end, we extend our discuss on the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation in the trimer systems. Our results are expected to be further verified through the inelastic neutron scattering and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and also provide valuable insights for exploring high-energy exotic excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>

Abstract: Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) or Matrix Product States (MPS) are widely acknowledged as highly effective and accurate methods for solving one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, the direct application of DMRG to the study two-dimensional systems encounters challenges due to the limited entanglement encoded in the wave-function ansatz. Conversely, Clifford circuits offer a promising avenue for simulating states with substantial entanglement, albeit confined to stabilizer states. In this work, we present the seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, leveraging the advantages of both Clifford circuits and DMRG. This integration leads to a significant enhancement in simulation accuracy with small additional computational cost. Moreover, this framework is useful not only for its current application but also for its potential to be easily adapted to various other numerical approaches</description>

      <title>Plaquette-type valence bond solid state in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square-lattice Heisenberg mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Fully Augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) methods to investigate the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model. To differentiate between the Columnar Valence Bond Solid (CVBS) and Plaquette Valence Bond Solid (PVBS) phases, we introduce an anisotropy $\Delta_y$ in the nearest neighboring coupling in the $y$-direction, aiming at detecting the possible spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. In the calculations, we push the bond dimension to as large as $D = 25000$ in FAMPS, simulating systems at a maximum size of $14 \times 14$. With a careful extrapolation of the truncation errors and appropriate finite-size scaling, followed by finite $\Delta_y$ scaling analysis of the VBS dimer order parameters, we identify the VBS phase as a PVBS type, meaning there is no spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. This study not only resolves the long-standing issue of the characterization of the VBS order in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model but also highlights the capabilities of FAMPS in the study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical spin ice under uniaxial strain along the $[111]$ crystallographic axis. Remarkably, such strain preserves the extensive ice degeneracy and the corresponding classical Coulomb phase. The emergent monopole excitations remain thermodynamically deconfined exactly as in the isotropic case. However, their motion under local heat bath dynamics depends qualitatively on the sign of the strain. In the low-temperature limit for negative strain, the monopoles diffuse, while for positive strain, they localize. Introducing additional ring exchange dynamics into the ice background transforms the localized monopoles into sub-dimensional excitations whose motion is restricted to diffusion in the $(111)$-plane. The phenomena we identify are experimentally accessible in rare-earth pyrochlores under uniaxial pressure as well as in tripod kagome materials. The diffusive versus localized nature of the monopoles manifests in characteristic magnetic noise spectra, which we compute.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials provide an ideal playground for studying the combined interplay of strong interactions and band-topology over a range of electronic fillings. Here we investigate the panoply of interaction-induced electronic phases that arise at a total commensurate filling of $\nu_T=2$ in moir\'e TMD heterobilayers, focusing specifically on their renormalized band-topology. We carry out a comprehensive self-consistent parton mean-field analysis on an interacting mixed-valence Hamiltonian describing AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ to highlight different ingredients that arise due to "Mottness", band-flattening, an enhanced excitonic tendency, and band-inversion, leading to correlated topological semi-metals and insulators. We also propose a possible route towards realizing fractionalized insulators with emergent neutral fermionic excitations in this and other closely related platforms.</description>

Abstract: A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder provides a minimal setup to explore an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant for understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp&lt;0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}&lt;0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Moreover, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.</description>

Abstract: The Hubbard model, a cornerstone in the field of condensed matter physics, serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper presents a novel perspective on the model, uncovering its inherent inverted duality which has profound implications for our comprehension of this complex system. Taking advantage of this special mathematical property, we have formulated an equation that the electron Green's function must satisfy. Our findings pave the way for further exploration and potentially new insights into the dynamics of electron correlations and phase transitions in the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Universal time evolution of string order parameter in quantum critical systems with boundary invertible or non-invertible symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global symmetry, either invertible or non-invertible, has been extensively studied in two dimensional conformal field theories in recent years. When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however, many interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break such global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking boundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that the boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time evolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry operators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order parameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole system, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface breaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface symmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time after a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local quantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order parameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting statistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution of string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of these two different types of string order parameters in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Valence Bond Crystal Ground State of the 1/9 Magnetization Plateau in the Spin-1/2 Kagome Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of a spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet at the 1/9 magnetization plateau, focusing primarily on six types of valence bond crystal (VBC) distortions. Among six types of VBC distortions, type 1 consistently exhibits the lowest ground-state energy. Analysis of the second derivative of the energy with respect to the distortion strength $J_{\rm d}$ using exact diagonalization reveals that, as the system size approaches the thermodynamic limit, the type 1 VBC state remains stable down to $J_{\rm d} = 1$, corresponding to the undistorted kagome lattice. Perturbation theory further supports the stability of the type 1 VBC state, providing energy values that agree with exact diagonalization results within 3%. We also explore the possibility that other types of VBC distortions could become the ground state, but type 1 VBC still exhibited the lowest energy. These findings suggest that the ground state of the 1/9 plateau in the kagome lattice is the type 1 VBC state.</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic excitations and charge order in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the complex ground state of van der Waals (vdW) magnets is essential for designing new materials and devices that leverage these platforms. Here, we investigate a two-dimensional vdW ferromagnet -- Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$-- with one of the highest reported Curie temperatures, to elucidate its magnetic excitations and charge order. Using Fe $L_3 - $edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we find the dual character of magnetic excitations, consisting of a coherent magnon and a continuum, similar to what is reported for its sister compound Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The magnon has an energy of $\approx$ 36 meV at the maximum in-plane momentum transfer ($-$0.35 r.l.u.) allowed at Fe $L_3 - $edge. A broad and non-dispersive continuum extends up to 150 meV, 50$\%$ higher energy than in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Its intensity is sinusoidally modulated along the $L$ direction, with a period matching the inter-slab distance. Our findings suggest that while the unconventional dual character of magnetic excitations is generic to ternary Fe-Ge-Te vdW magnets, the correlation length of the out-of-plane magnetic interaction increases in Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ as compared to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, supporting a stronger three-dimensional character for the former. Furthermore, by investigating the $\pm$(1/3, 1/3, $L$) peaks by resonant x-ray diffraction, we conclude these to have structural origin rather than charge order -- as previously reported -- and suggest doubling of the structural unit cell along the $c-$axis.</description>

      <title>Beyond MP2 initialization for unitary coupled cluster quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05666v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz is a promising tool for achieving high-precision results using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in the NISQ era. However, results on quantum hardware are thus far very limited and simulations have only accessed small system sizes. We advance the state of the art of UCC simulations by utilizing an efficient sparse wavefunction circuit solver and studying systems up to 64 qubits. Here we report results obtained using this solver that demonstrate the power of the UCC ansatz and address pressing questions about optimal initial parameterizations and circuit construction, among others. Our approach enables meaningful benchmarking of the UCC ansatz, a crucial step in assessing the utility of VQE for achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Aspects of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T }$ deformed Schwarzian: From gravity partition function to late-time spectral form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different thermodynamic properties of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T}$ deformed Schwarzian theory and its different gravitational perspectives. First, we compute the partition function of $U(1)$ coupled 2D-gravity with fixed chemical potential, obtained from the dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. Then, we compute the partition function of the gravity theory which is the dual to the deformed Schwarzian living on its boundary and study the genus expansion of the one and two-point correlation function of the partition function of the theory. Subsequently, we use the one-point function to compute the "Annealed" and "Quenched" free energy in low-temperature limits and make a qualitative comparison with the undeformed theory. Then, using the two-point function, we compute the Spectral Form Factor of the deformed theory in early and late time. We find a dip and ramp structure in early and late time, respectively. We also get a plateau structure in the $\tau$-scaling limit. Last but not least, we comment on the late-time topology change to give a physical interpretation of the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor for our theory.</description>

      <title>Exact Hidden Markovian Dynamics in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a challenging frontier of physics. In this Letter, we systematically construct solvable nonintegrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact hidden Markovian subsystem dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show that the influence of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the subsystem with an ancilla of finite Hilbert space dimension. The realization of exact hidden Markovian property is facilitated by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

      <title>Fermionic tensor network methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how fermionic statistics can be naturally incorporated in tensor networks on arbitrary graphs through the use of graded Hilbert spaces. This formalism allows to use tensor network methods for fermionic lattice systems in a local way, avoiding the need of a Jordan-Wigner transformation or the explicit tracking of leg crossings by swap gates in 2D tensor networks. The graded Hilbert spaces can be readily integrated with other internal and lattice symmetries in tensor networks, and only require minor extensions to an existing tensor network software package. We review and benchmark the fermionic versions of common algorithms for matrix product states and projected entangled-pair states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Embedding of Non-local Quantum Many-body Interactions in Prototypal Anti-tumor Vaccine Metalloprotein on Near Term Quantum Computing Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real world obeys quantum physics and quantum computing presents an alternative way to map physical problems to systems that follow the same laws. Such computation fundamentally constitutes a better way to understand the most challenging quantum problems. One such problem is the accurate simulation of highly correlated quantum systems. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem classical computers require considerable computer power to accurately predict material properties, especially when strong electron interactions are present. Still, modern day quantum hardware has many limitations and only allows for modeling of very simple systems. Here we present for the first time a quantum computer model simulation of a complex hemocyanin molecule, which is an important respiratory protein involved in various physiological processes such as oxygen transport and immune defence, and is also used as a key component in therapeutic vaccines for cancer. To better characterise the mechanism by which hemocyanin transports oxygen, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on fermionic excitations and quantum embedding methods is used in the context of dynamic mean field theory to solve Anderson impurity model (AIM). Finally, it is concluded that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin is largely influenced by the many-body correction and that the computational effort for solving correlated electron systems could be substantially reduced with the introduction of quantum computing algorithms. We encourage the use of the Hamiltonian systems presented in this paper as a benchmark for testing quantum computing algorithms efficiency for chemistry applications.</description>
