      <title>Fuzzy Gasoline: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation with Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in a Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) framework. These simulations were performed with a new version of the GASOLINE2 code, known as FUZZY-GASOLINE, which can simulate quantum FDM effects alongside a comprehensive baryonic model that includes metal cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and black hole physics, previously used in the NIHAO simulation suite. Using thirty zoom-in simulations of galaxies with halo masses in the range $10^9 \lesssim M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{11}$, we explore how the interplay between FDM quantum potential and baryonic processes influences dark matter distributions and observable galaxy properties. Our findings indicate that both baryons and low-mass FDM contribute to core formation within dark matter profiles, though through distinct mechanisms: FDM-induced cores emerge in all haloes, particularly within low-mass systems at high redshift, while baryon-driven cores form within a specific mass range and at low redshift. Despite these significant differences in dark matter structure, key stellar observables such as star formation histories and velocity dispersion profiles remain remarkably similar to predictions from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, making it challenging to distinguish between CDM and FDM solely through stellar observations.</description>

      <title>The [C II] line emission as an ISM probe in the MARIGOLD galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The [C II] fine-structure line at 157.74 $\mu$m is one of the brightest far-infrared emission lines and an important probe of galaxy properties like the star formation rate (SFR) and the molecular gas mass ($M_{\mathrm{mol}}$). Using high-resolution numerical simulations, we test the reliability of the [C II] line as a tracer of $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ in high-redshift galaxies and investigate secondary dependences of the [C II]-$M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ relation on the SFR and metallicity. We investigate the time evolution of the [C II] luminosity function (LF) and the relative spatial extent of [C II] emission and star formation. We post-process galaxies from the MARIGOLD simulations at redshifts $3 \le z \leq 7$ to obtain their [C II] emission. These simulations were performed with the sub-grid chemistry model, HYACINTH, to track the non-equilibrium abundances of $\mathrm{H_2}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\rm C$ and $\mathrm{C^+}$ on the fly. Based on a statistical sample of galaxies at these redshifts, we investigate correlations between the [C II] line luminosity, L([C II]), and the SFR, the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$, the total gas mass and the metal mass in gas phase ($M_{\mathrm{metal}}$). We find that accounting for secondary dependencies in the L([C II])-$M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ relation improves the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ prediction by a factor of 2.3. The [C II] emission in our simulated galaxies shows the tightest correlation with $M_{\mathrm{metal}}$. About 20% (10%) of our simulated galaxies at $z=5$ ($z=4$) have [C II] emission extending $\geq 2$ times farther than the star formation activity. The [C II] LF evolves rapidly and is always well approximated by a double power law that does not show an exponential cutoff at the bright end. We record a 600-fold increase in the number density of L([C II]) $\sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{L_{\odot}}$ emitters in 1.4 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Changing Look AGN: An X-ray Look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, a number of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known. We studied, in detail what happens to the X-ray spectrum during the CL events using the example of the nearby CL Seyfert NGC1566, which was observed by Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. We applied the Comptonization model to describe an evolution of NGC~1566 X-ray spectra during outbursts and compared these results with a typical behavior for other AGNs to identify some differences and common properties that can ultimately help us to better understand the physics of the CL phenomenon. We found that changes in the X-ray properties of NGC1566 are characterized by a different combination of Sy1 (using 1H0707-495 as a representative) and Sy2 properties (using NGC7679 and Mrk3 as their representatives). At high X-ray luminosities NGC1566 exhibits the behavior typical for Sy1, and at low luminosities we see a transition of NGC1566 from the Sy1 behavior to the Sy2 pattern. We revealed the saturation of the spectral indices, \=a for these four AGNs during outbursts (\=a_1566~1.1, \=a _0707~2, \=a _7679~0.9 and \=a_mrk3~0.9) and determined the masses of the black holes (BHs) in the centers of these AGNs namely, M_0707~6.8x10^7 M_sol, M_7679~8.4x10^6 M_sol, M_mrk3~2.2x10^8 M_sol and M_1566~2x10^5 M_sol, applying the scaling method. Our spectral analysis shows that the changing-look of NGC1566 from Sy1.2 to Sy1.9 in 2019 was accompanied by the transition of NGC1566 to an accretion regime which is typical for the intermediate and highly soft spectral states of other BHs. We also find that when going from Sy2 to Sy1, the spectrum of NGC1566 shows an increase in the soft excess accompanied by a decrease in the Comptonized fraction (0.1&lt;f&lt;0.5), which is consistent with the typical behavior of BH sources during X-ray outburst decay.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Young Stellar Objects Under Various Stellar Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Gaia Data Release 3 and APOGEE datasets, we investigate the kinematic differences between young stellar objects (YSOs) and their parent clouds in five nearby star-forming regions. Overall, the 1D velocity differences between Class II YSOs and their parent molecular cloud range from [0, 1.4] km/s. In feedback environments dominated by outflows, massive stars, and supernova feedback, the corresponding velocity differences range from [0, 1.4] km/s, [0.1, 0.4] km/s, and [0.1, 1] km/s, respectively. These results indicate that YSO kinematics are not significantly affected by these different types of feedback environment. Additionally, compared to the Class II YSOs, Class III YSOs have slightly larger velocities and dispersions.</description>

      <title>The HI Mass Function of the Local Universe: Combining Measurements from HIPASS, ALFALFA and FASHI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first HI mass function (HIMF) measurement for the recent FAST All Sky HI (FASHI) survey and the most complete measurements of HIMF in the local universe so far by combining the HI catalogues from HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS), Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) and FASHI surveys at redshift 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.05, covering 76% of the entire sky. We adopt the same methods to estimate distances, calculate sample completeness, and determine the HIMF for all three surveys. The best-fitting Schechter function for the total HIMF has a low-mass slope parameter alpha = -1.30 and a knee mass log(Ms) = 9.86 and a normalization phi_s = 0.00658. This gives the cosmic HI abundance omega_HI= 0.000454. We find that a double Schechter function with the same slope alpha better describes our HIMF, and the two different knee masses are log(Ms1) = 9.96 and log(Ms2) = 9.65. We verify that the measured HIMF is marginally affected by the choice of distance estimates. The effect of cosmic variance is significantly suppressed by combining the three surveys and it provides a unique opportunity to obtain an unbiased estimate of the HIMF in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the history of Galactic spiral arms revealed by Gaia GSP-Spec alpha-elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of chemical elements in the Galactic disc can reveal fundamental clues on the physical processes that led to the current configuration of our Galaxy. We map chemical azimuthal variations in the disc using individual stellar chemical abundances and discuss their possible connection with the spiral arms and other perturbing mechanisms. Using Gaia Data Release 3, we examine [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] fluctuations in a ~4 kpc region around the Sun, focusing on bright giant stars. We implemented a kernel density estimator technique to enhance the chemical inhomogeneities. We observe radial gradients and azimuthal fluctuations in [alpha/Fe] for young (&lt;150 Myr) and old (&gt;2 Gyr) stars, with amplitudes varying according to the studied element. In young stars, those within spiral arms (e.g., Sagittarius-Carina and Local arms) are generally more metal and calcium-rich (~0-0.19 dex) but show lower [Ca/Fe] (~0.06 dex) and [Mg/Fe] (~0.05 dex) compared to inter-arm regions, suggesting enhanced iron production in spiral arms. These [alpha/Fe] depletions are analysed in light of theoretical scenarios and compared to a 2D chemical evolution model with multiple spiral patterns. For the old sample, [Ca/Fe] maps reveal deficiencies along a segment of the Local arm identified by young stars. We caution that, for this old sample, the quality of the obtained maps might be limited along a specific line-of-sight, due to the Gaia scanning law. This study transitions our understanding of disc chemical evolution from a 1D radial view to a more detailed 2D framework incorporating radial, azimuthal, and small-scale variations. Individual chemical abundances prove essential for tracing spiral arms in disc galaxies. We recommend models and simulations incorporate alpha-abundance trends to better address spiral arm lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Rare Group of Dwarf Galaxies in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a rare isolated group of five dwarf galaxies located at z = 0.0086 ($D$ = 36 Mpc). All member galaxies are star-forming, blue, and gas-rich with $g-r$ indices ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 mag, and two of them show signs of ongoing mutual interaction. The most massive member of the group has a stellar mass that is half of the Small Magellanic Cloud stellar mass, and the median stellar mass of the group members is 7.87 $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$. The derived total dynamical mass of the group is $M_{\rm dyn}$ = 6.02$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, whereas its total baryonic mass (stellar + HI) is 2.6$\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, which gives us the dynamical to baryonic mass ratio of 23. Interestingly, all galaxies found in the group are aligned along a straight line in the plane of the sky. The observed spatial extent of the member galaxies is 154 kpc, and their relative line-of-sight velocity span is within 75 km s$^{-1}$. Using the spatially resolved optical spectra provided by DESI EDR, we find that three group members share a common rotational direction. With these unique properties of the group and its member galaxies, we discuss the possible importance of such a system in the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxy groups and in testing the theory of large-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Tracing 3-D Magnetic Field Structure Using Dust Polarization and the Zeeman Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of magnetic fields within molecular clouds is fundamental to understanding star formation processes. Accurately gauging the three-dimensional structure of these fields presents a challenge, as observational techniques such as dust polarization and the Zeeman effect each provide only partial information on the orientation and line-of-sight strength, respectively. By analyzing a suite of AREPO simulations, this paper investigates how observables can relate to underlying physical properties to derive a more comprehensive picture of the magnetic field's inclination angle and strength, specifically in regions where both dust polarization and Zeeman data are available. To demonstrate the method, we produce synthetic observations of the polarization angle dispersion and line-of-sight Alfv\'en Mach Number and explore the behavior of the inclination angle, $\gamma$, and strength of the magnetic field in regions where both Zeeman and dust polarization data are available. We find that dust polarization data can be used to determine the inclination angle if the cloud is known to be trans-Alfv\'enic or sub-Alfv\'enic. The strength of the magnetic field relative to turbulence can be estimated by comparing polarization observations to Zeeman observations. Comparing the dispersion of the polarization angle to the estimated line-of-sight Alfv\'en Mach Number provides clues about the strength of the magnetic field and, consequently, the orientation of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Galaxy Interactions on Starbursts in Milky Way-Mass Galaxies in FIRE Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations and observations suggest that galaxy interactions may enhance the star formation rate (SFR) in merging galaxies. One proposed mechanism is the torque exerted on the gas and stars in the larger galaxy by the smaller galaxy. We analyze the interaction torques and star formation activity on six galaxies from the FIRE-2 simulation suite with masses comparable to the Milky Way galaxy at redshift $z=0$. We trace the halos from $z = 3.6$ to $z=0$, calculating the torque exerted by the nearby galaxies on the gas in the central galaxy. We calculate the correlation between the torque and the SFR across the simulations for various mass ratios. For near-equal-stellar-mass-ratio interactions in the galaxy sample, occurring between $z=1.2-3.6$, there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between the torque from nearby galaxies on the gas of the central galaxies and the SFR. For all other samples, no statistically significant correlation is found between the torque and the SFR. Our analysis shows that some, but not all, major interactions cause starbursts in the simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies, and that most starbursts are not caused by galaxy interactions. The transition from `bursty' at high redshift ($z\gtrsim1$) to `steady' star-formation state at later times is independent of the interaction history of the galaxies, and most of the interactions do not leave significant imprints on the overall trend of the star formation history of the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Boxy/peanut shaping of a mature galactic bar in action-angle space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vertical resonant trapping and resonant heating of orbits. These two processes both lead to the growth of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge in a typical $N$-body model. For the first time, we study this by means of the action variables and resonant angles of the actual orbits that compose the model itself. We used the resonant angle instead of the frequency ratio, which allowed us to clearly distinguish between these two processes in numerical simulations. We show that trapping and heating occur simultaneously, at least at the stage of a mature bar, that is, some orbits quickly pass through vertical resonance while at the same time, a substantial number of orbits remains trapped into this stage for a long time. Half of all bar orbits spend more than 2.5 Gyr in vertical resonance over an interval of 4 Gyr. Half of the orbits trapped into the bar over the last 3 Gyr of simulation remain captured in vertical resonance for more than 2 Gyr. We conclude that in the later stages of the bar evolution, the process of vertical trapping dominates in the ongoing process that causes the boxy/peanut shape of a bar in a typical $N$-body model. This contradicts the results of several recent works.</description>

      <title>The SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): Data Analysis Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) project, referred to as the LVM-DAP. We outline our methods for recovering both stellar and emission line components from the optical integral field spectroscopy, highlighting the developments and changes implemented to address specific challenges of the data set. The observations from the LVM project are unique because they cover a wide range of physical resolutions, from approximately 0.05 pc to 100 pc, depending on the distance to the targets. This, along with the varying number of stars sampled in each aperture (ranging from zero, just one of a few, to thousands), presents challenges in using previous spectral synthesis methods and interpreting the spectral fits. We provide a detailed explanation of how we model the stellar content and separate it from the ionized gas emission lines. To assess the accuracy of our results, we compare them with both idealized and more realistic simulations, highlighting the limitations of our methods. We find that the DAP robustly correct for stellar continuum features and recover emission line parameters (e.g. flux, equivalent width, systemtic velocity and velocity dispersion) with a precision and accuracy that fulfill the requirements of the primary goal of the analysis. In addition, the recovered stellar parameters are reliable for single stars, the recovery of integrated populations is less precise. We conclude with a description of the data products we provide, instructions for downloading and using our software, and a showcase illustrating the quality of the data and the analysis on a deep exposure taken on the Huygens region at the center of the Orion Nebula.</description>

      <title>Gas thermodynamics meets galaxy kinematics: Joint mass measurements for eROSITA galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters is a critical quantity for probing cluster cosmology and testing theories of gravity, but its measurement could be biased given assumptions are inevitable. In this paper, we employ and compare two mass proxies for galaxy clusters: thermodynamics of the intracluster medium and kinematics of member galaxies. We select 22 galaxy clusters from the cluster catalog in the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) that have sufficient optical and near-infrared observations. We generate multi-band images in the energy range of (0.3, 7) keV for each cluster, and derive their temperature profiles, gas mass profiles and hydrostatic mass profiles using a parametric approach that does not assume dark matter halo models. With spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies collected from multiple surveys, we numerically solve the spherical Jeans equation for their dynamical mass profiles. Our results quantify the correlation between dynamical mass and line-of-sight velocity dispersion with an rms scatter of 0.14 dex. We find the two mass proxies lead to roughly the same total mass, with no observed systematic bias. As such, the $\sigma_8$ tension is not specific to hydrostatic mass or weak lensing shears, but also appears with galaxy kinematics. We also compare our hydrostatic masses with the latest weak lensing masses inferred with scaling relations. The comparison shows the weak lensing mass is significantly higher than our hydrostatic mass by $\sim$110%. This might explain the significantly larger value of $\sigma_8$ from the latest measurement using eRASS1 clusters than almost all previous estimates in the literature. Finally, we test the radial acceleration relation (RAR) established in disk galaxies. We confirm the missing baryon problem in the inner region of galaxy clusters using three independent mass proxies for the first time.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous high-angular-resolution imaging of the AGB star W Hya in vibrationally excited H2O lines and visible polarized light with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and visible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W Hya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar radii. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at 268 and 251 GHz with ALMA at a spatial resolution of 16 x 20 mas and at 748 and 820 nm at a resolution of 26 x 27 mas with the VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. ALMA's high spatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally excited H2O line at 268 GHz (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 6_5,2 - 7_4,3) over the stellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected for thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and just outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii), extending to ~60 mas (~2.9 stellar radii). Another H2O line (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 9_2,8 - 8_3,5) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy was tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface. This suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHzH2O line is suprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O density are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line reveals global infall at up to ~15 km/s within 2--3 stellar radii, but outflows at up to ~8 km/s are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the visible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii) with a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in the east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible polarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely maser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the inhomogeneous atmosphere within ~2--3 stellar radii.</description>

      <title>The relation between the ADF and the ionized nebular mass in PNe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the proposed relation between ADFs and ionized masses in planetary nebulae. For this, we have collected from the literature the ADFs and other parameters such as heliocentric distances, H$\beta$ luminosities, logarithmic reddening correction at H$\beta$, c(H$\beta$), electron densities and others and we calculated the ionized mass for a sample of 132 PNe, 27 of which possess a binary central star (14 are close binaries). In addition the distribution of these objects in the Galaxy is analyzed. The ionized masses were calculated considering two different electron densities, the one provided by the [S II] density sensitive lines ratio and the one provided by the [Cl III] lines ratio. No relation was found between ionized masses and ADFs for this sample, although it is confirmed than the PNe with the largest ADFs correspond in general to objects with a close binary central star, although it is important to say that about 20 percent of these objects have an ADF larger than 5 but smaller than 10. Therefore a PN having a close binary central star does not necessarily exhibit an extremely large ADF. We also have searched for possible relations between the ADFs and the stellar atmospheres, divided in H-rich and H-poor stars. No particular relation was found. Interestingly, several PNe with a [WR] H-poor CSPN present an ADF larger than 10, but so far they have not been reported as having a binary central star.</description>

      <title>Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode $\sigma_e \simeq 0.30$. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to $10^3$days (possibly extending to tens of AU).
  This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of $\sigma_e \simeq \sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_*}$. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.</description>

      <title>On the Dust properties of the UV galaxies in the redshift range $z \sim 0.6-1.2$</title>

Abstract: Far-infrared observations from the \textit{Herschel Space Observatory} are used to estimate the infrared (IR) properties of ultraviolet-selected galaxies. We stack the PACS (100, 160 $\mu \mathrm{m}$) and SPIRE (250, 350 and 500$\mu \mathrm{m}$) maps of the Chandra deep field south (CDFS) on a source list of galaxies selected in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) in a redshift range of $0.6-1.2$. This source list is created using observations from the XMM-OM telescope survey in the CDFS using the UVW1 (2910 {\AA}) filter. The stacked data are binned according to the UV luminosity function of these sources, and the average photometry of the UV-selected galaxies is estimated. By fitting modified black bodies and IR model templates to the stacked photometry, average dust temperatures and total IR luminosity are determined. The luminosity-weighted average temperatures are consistent with a weak trend of increasing temperature with redshift found by previous studies. Infrared excess, unobscured, and obscured star formation rate (SFR) values are obtained from the UV and IR luminosities. We see a trend in which dust attenuation increases as UV luminosity decreases. It remains constant as a function of IR luminosities at fixed redshift across the luminosity range of our sources. In comparison to local luminous infrared galaxies with similar SFRs, the higher redshift star-forming galaxies in the sample show a lesser degree of dust attenuation. Finally, the inferred dust attenuation is used to correct the unobscured SFR density in the redshift range $0.6-1.2$. The dust-corrected SFR density is consistent with measurements from IR-selected samples at similar redshifts.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI unveils the stellar component of the GN20 dusty galaxy overdensity at $z$=4.05</title>

Abstract: Despite the importance of the dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z$&gt;2 for understanding the galaxy evolution in the early Universe, their stellar distributions traced by the near-IR emission were spatially unresolved until the arrival of the JWST. In this work we present, for the first time, a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame near-IR (~1.1-3.5$\mu$m) emission in DSFGs traced with the JWST/MIRI. In particular, we study the mature stellar component for the three DSFGs and a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) present in an overdensity at $z$=4.05. Moreover, we use MIRI images along with UV to (sub)-mm ancillary photometric data to model their SEDs and extract their main physical properties. The sub-arcsec resolution MIRI images have revealed that the stellar component present a wide range of morphologies, from disc-like to compact and clump-dominated structures. These near-IR structures contrast with their UV emission, which is usually diffuse and off-centered. The SED fitting analysis shows that GN20 dominates the total SFR with a value ~2500 $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ while GN20.2b has the highest stellar mass in the sample ($M_*$~2$\times$10$^{11}$ $M_\odot$). The two DSFGs classified as LTGs (GN20 and GN20.2a) show high specific SFR (sSFR&gt;30 Gyr$^{-1}$) placing them above the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) at z~4 by &gt;0.5 dex while the ETG (i.e.,GN20.2b) is compatible with the high-mass end of the main sequence. When comparing with other DSFGs in overdensities at $z$~2-7 we observe that our objects present similar SFRs, depletion times and projected separations. Nevertheless, the effective radii computed for GN20 and GN20.2a are up to two times larger than those of isolated galaxies observed in CEERS and ALMA-HUDF at similar redshifts. We interpret this difference in size as an effect of rapid growth induced by the dense environment.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- The intracluster light and intracluster globular clusters of the Perseus cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the intracluster light (ICL) and intracluster globular clusters (ICGCs) in the nearby Perseus galaxy cluster using Euclid's EROs. By modelling the isophotal and iso-density contours, we mapped the distributions and properties of the ICL and ICGCs out to radii of 200-600 kpc (up to ~1/3 of the virial radius) from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the central 500 kpc hosts 70000$\pm$2800 GCs and $1.7\times10^{12}$ L$_\odot$ of diffuse light from the BCG+ICL in the near-infrared H$_E$. This accounts for 38$\pm$6% of the cluster's total stellar luminosity within this radius. The ICL and ICGCs share a coherent spatial distribution, suggesting a common origin or that a common potential governs their distribution. Their contours on the largest scales (&gt;200 kpc) are offset from the BCG's core westwards by 60 kpc towards several luminous cluster galaxies. This offset is opposite to the displacement observed in the gaseous intracluster medium. The radial surface brightness profile of the BCG+ICL is best described by a double S\'ersic model, with 68$\pm$4% of the H$_E$ light in the extended, outer component. The transition between these components occurs at ~60 kpc, beyond which the isophotes become increasingly elliptical and off-centred. The radial ICGC number density profile closely follows the BCG+ICL profile only beyond this 60 kpc radius, where we find an average of 60-80 GCs per $10^9$ M$_\odot$ of diffuse stellar mass. The BCG+ICL colour becomes increasingly blue with radius, consistent with the stellar populations in the ICL having subsolar metallicities [Fe/H] ~ -0.6 to -1.0. The colour of the ICL, and the specific frequency and luminosity function of the ICGCs suggest that the ICL+ICGCs were tidally stripped from the outskirts of massive satellites with masses of a few $\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, with an increasing contribution from dwarf galaxies at large radii.</description>

      <title>Modelling the multi-wavelength detection of protoclusters. I: An excess of submillimetre galaxies in protocluster cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of galaxy protoclusters yield insights into galaxy cluster formation complementary to those obtained via `archaeological' studies of present-day galaxy clusters. Submillimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs) are one class of sources used to find high-redshift protoclusters. However, due to the rarity of protoclusters (and thus the large simulation volume required) and the complexity of modeling dust emission from galaxies, the relationship between SMGs and protoclusters has not been adequately addressed in the theoretical literature. In this work, we apply the L-GALAXIES semi-analytic model (SAM) to the Millennium N-body simulation. We assign submillimetre (submm) flux densities to the model galaxies using a scaling relation from previous work, in which dust radiative transfer was performed on high-resolution galaxy zoom simulations. We find that the fraction of model galaxies that are submm-bright is higher in protocluster cores than in both protocluster `outskirts' and the field; the fractions for the latter two are similar. This excess is not driven by an enhanced starburst frequency. Instead, the primary reason is that overdense environments have a relative overdensity of high-mass halos and thus `oversample' the high-mass end of the star formation main sequence relative to less-dense environments. The fraction of SMGs that are optically bright is dependent on stellar mass and redshift but independent of environment. The fraction of galaxies for which the majority of star formation is dust-obscured is higher in protocluster cores, primarily due to the dust-obscured fraction being correlated with stellar mass. Our results can be used to guide and interpret multi-wavelength studies of galaxy populations in protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurements of the LMC Bar's Geometry With Gaia DR3 and a Novel Solution to Crowding Induced Incompleteness in Star Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the two-dimensional (2-D) geometry of the LMC's stellar bar with precise astrometric observations of red clump stars in Gaia DR3. We develop a novel solution to tackle crowding induced incompleteness in Gaia datasets with the Gaia BP-RP color excess. Utilizing the color excess information, we derive a 2-D completeness map of the LMC's disk. We find that incompleteness biases the bar measurements and induces large uncertainties. With the completeness-corrected 2-D red clump map, we precisely measure the LMC bar's properties for the first time using Fourier decomposition. The bar radius is $R_{bar} = 2.13^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ kpc, and its position angle is $121.26^{\circ} \pm 0.21^{\circ}$. The bar's strength as quantified by the Fourier bi-symmetric amplitude is $S_{bar} = 0.27$, indicating that the LMC has a significant bar perturbation. We find the bar has an axis ratio of $0.54 \pm 0.03$, and is offset with respect to the center of the outer disk isophote at R $\approx$ 5 kpc by $0.76 \pm 0.01$ kpc. These LMC bar properties agree with a hydrodynamic model where the SMC has undergone a recent direct collision with the LMC. We compare the LMC's bar properties with other barred galaxies in the local universe, and discover that the LMC is similar to other barred galaxies in terms of bar-galaxy scaling relations. We discuss how our completeness correction framework can be applied to other systems in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Implication of a galaxy-scale negative feedback by one of the most powerful multi-phase outflows in a hyper-luminous infrared galaxy at the intermediate redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powerful, galactic outflows driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly considered as a main mechanism to regulate star formation in massive galaxies. Ultra- and hyper-luminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to represent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a quiescent status as gas swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory to investigate outflows and their feedback effects on the hosts. In this paper we report recent Gemini and ALMA observations of a HyLIRG, J1126 at $z=0.46842$, which has been identified with a puzzling co-existence of a fast ionized outflow ($&gt;2000$ km s$^{-1}$) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of 800 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized outflow is extended to several kpc with a mass-loss rate of 180 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is revealed by ALMA. The multi-phase outflows show large factors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by thermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or radiation pressure of a highly obscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that the powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and enhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow probably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to regulate the host growth in a long term.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>

Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>Radiative transfer of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons at cosmic dawn with realistic gas physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ photons enable the cosmic dawn 21-cm signal through a process called the Wouthuysen-Field effect. An accurate model of the signal in this epoch hinges on the accuracy of the computation of the Ly$\alpha$ coupling, which requires one to calculate the specific intensity of Ly$\alpha$ photons emitted from the first stars. Most traditional calculations of the Ly$\alpha$ coupling assume a delta-function scattering cross-section, as the resonant nature of the Ly$\alpha$ scattering makes an accurate radiative transfer (RT) solution computationally expensive. Attempts to improve upon this traditional approach using numerical RT have recently emerged. However, some of these treatments suffer from assumptions such as a uniform gas distribution, coherent scattering in the gas frame and isotropic scattering. While others which do not account for these only do so through certain schemes along with core-skipping algorithms. We present results from a self-consistent Monte Carlo RT simulations devoid of any of the assumptions in the previous work for the first time. We find that gas bulk motion is the most important effect to account for in RT resulting in an RMS difference of 38% in the 21-cm signal and anisotropic scattering being the least important effect contributing to less than 3% RMS difference in 21-cm signal. We also evaluate the 21-cm power spectrum and compare that with the traditional results at cosmic dawn. This work points the way towards higher-accuracy models to enable better inferences from future measurements.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic origin of two dormant BH binaries: Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two systems, namely, Gaia~BH1 and Gaia~BH2, that have been confirmed as dormant (i.e., no X-ray emission detected) black hole (BH) - low-mass star binaries in the latest Gaia mission data release (DR3) are intriguing in the context of their formation and evolution. Both systems consist of $\sim9$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ BH and $\sim1$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ star orbiting each other on a wide, eccentric orbit ($e\sim 0.5$). We argue that formation of such Gaia~BH-like systems through the isolated binary evolution (IBE) channel, under the standard common envelope assumptions, and from dynamical interactions in young massive and open clusters are equally probable, and that the formation rate of such binaries is of the order of $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}$ for both channels. We estimate that, according to our models, there are at most $\sim900$ detectable Gaia~BH-like binaries in the Milky Way thin disc. What plays an important role in formation of Gaia~BH-like systems via the IBE channel is the mutual position of the natal kick velocity vector and the binary angular momentum vector. We find that natal kicks with a median magnitude of $\sim40$ km/s are preferred for the formation of Gaia~BH1-like binaries. Approximately $94\%$ of those binaries are formed with the BH spin misaligned to the orbital axis by less than $40^{\circ}$. Gaia~BH2-like binaries form if the low velocity natal kick (of median magnitude $\sim20$ km/s) is directed within $15^{\circ}$ about the orbital plane. In addition to natal kick, we also discuss the influence of tidal interaction and the adopted common envelope $\lambda_\mathrm{ce}$~parameter prescription on the evolution of Gaia~BH-like binaries. We follow the subsequent evolution of the binaries, once formed as Gaia~BH1 and Gaia~BH2 systems, to investigate their connection with the low-mass X-ray binary population.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Highly Ionized Outflow in the Quasi-periodically Erupting Source GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring every few hours, associated with supermassive black holes. Many interpretations for QPEs were proposed since their recent discovery in 2019, including extreme mass ratio inspirals and accretion disk instabilities. But, as of today, their nature still remains debated. We perform the first high-resolution X-ray spectral study of a QPE source using the RGS gratings onboard XMM-Newton, leveraging nearly 2 Ms of exposure on GSN 069, the first discovered source of this class. We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N VII rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile. We apply photoionization spectral models and identify the absorption lines as an outflow blueshifted by $1700-2900$ km/s, with a column density of about $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an ionization parameter $\log (\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1})$ of $3.9-4.6$. The emission lines are instead redshifted by up to 2900 km/s, and likely originate from the same outflow that imprints the absorption features, and covers the full $4\pi$ sky from the point of view of GSN 069. The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069 which began around 2010.</description>

      <title>Permanent Capture into the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, an interesting region about the Sun in phase space is described where the permanent capture of an object, $P$, of small mass from interstellar space can occur, under the gravitational perturbation of the resultant mass of the Galaxy. $P$ is never ejected back into interstellar space and won't collide with the Sun. It cycles about the Sun for all time, asymptotically approaching the capture set. In addition to being permanently captured, $P$ is also weakly captured. A recent result in \cite{Belbruno:2024} describes this region in general. It has a fractal structure. This is applied to the permanent capture of rogue planets and other objects from interstellar space</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</description>

      <title>Black hole spin evolution across cosmic time from the NewHorizon simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes (BHs) have two fundamental properties: mass and spin. While the mass-evolution of BHs has been extensively studied, much less work has been done on predicting the distribution of BH spins. In this paper we present the spin evolution for a sample of intermediate-mass and massive BHs from the newHorizon simulation, which evolved BH spin across cosmic time in a full cosmological context through gas accretion, BH-BH mergers and BH feedback including jet spindown. As BHs grow, their spin evolution alternates between being dominated by gas accretion and BH mergers. Massive BHs are generally highly spinning. Accounting for the spin energy extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism increases the scatter in BH spins, especially in the mass range $10^{5-7} \rm \ M_\odot$, where BHs had previously been predicted to be almost universally maximally spinning. We find no evidence for spin-down through efficient chaotic accretion. As a result of their high spin values, massive BHs have an average radiative efficiency of $&lt;\varepsilon_{\rm r}^{\rm thin}&gt; \approx 0.19$. As BHs spend much of their time at low redshift with a radiatively inefficient thick disc, BHs in our sample remain hard to observe. Different observational methods probe different sub-populations of BHs, significantly influencing the observed distribution of spins. Generally, X-ray-based methods and higher luminosity cuts increase the average observed BH spin. When taking BH spin evolution into account, BHs inject on average between 3 times (in quasar mode) and 8 times (in radio mode) as much feedback energy into their host galaxy as previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of Galactic Cepheids from long-baseline interferometry V. High-accuracy orbital parallax and mass of SU Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cepheid masses are particularly necessary to help solving the mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes. We used CHARA/MIRC to measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from the HST. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provides the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, $M_A = 4.859\pm0.058M_\odot$, and its two companions, $M_{Ba} = 3.595 \pm 0.033 M_\odot$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.546 \pm 0.009 M_\odot$. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2%). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be $926.3 \pm 5.0$pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of $6\mu$as (0.5%), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\sim$ 2030) for single stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.</description>
