      <title>Inequality in a model of capitalist economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze inequality aspects of the agent-based model of capitalist economy named it Social Architecture of Capitalism that has been introduced by Ian Wright. The model contemplates two main types of agents, workers and capitalists, which can also be unemployed. Starting from a state where all agents are unemployed and possess the same initial wealth, the system, governed by a few simple rules, quickly self-organizes into two classes. After a transient, the model reproduces the statistics of many relevant macroeconomic quantities of real economies worldwide, notably the Boltzmann-Pareto regimes of the distributions of wealth and income. We perform extensive simulations testing the role of the model parameters (number of agents, total wealth, and salary range) on the resulting distribution of wealth and income, the social distribution of agents, and other stylized facts of the dynamics. Our main finding is that, according to the model, in an economy where total wealth is conserved and with a fixed average wage, the increase in wealth per capita comes with more inequality.</description>

      <title>Modelling vehicle and pedestrian collective dynamics: Challenges and advancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our urbanised societies, the management and regulation of traffic and pedestrian flows is of considerable interest for public safety, economic development, and the conservation of the environment. However, modelling and controlling the collective dynamics of vehicles and pedestrians raises several challenges. Not only are the individual entities self-propelled and hard to describe, but their complex nonlinear physical and social interactions makes the multi-agent problem of crowd and traffic flow even more involved. In this chapter, we purport to review the suitability and limitations of classical modelling approaches through four examples of collective behaviour: stop-and-go waves in traffic flow, lane formation, long-term avoidance behaviour, and load balancing in pedestrian dynamics. While stop-and-go dynamics and lane formation can both be addressed by basic reactive models (at least to some extent), the latter two require anticipation and/or coordination at the level of the group. The results highlight the limitations of classical force-based models, but also the need for long-term anticipation mechanisms and multiscale modelling approaches. In response, we review new developments and modelling concepts.</description>

      <title>Seasonal social dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social dilemmas where the good of a group is at odds with individual interests are usually considered as static -- the dilemma does not change over time. In the COVID-19 pandemic, social dilemmas occurred in the mitigation of epidemic spread: Should I reduce my contacts or wear a mask to protect others? In the context of respiratory diseases, which are predominantly spreading during the winter months, some of these situations re-occur seasonally. We couple a game theoretical model, where individuals can adjust their behavior, to an epidemiological model with seasonal forcing. We find that social dilemmas can occur annually and that behavioral reactions to them can either decrease or increase the peaks of infections in a population. Our work has not only implications for seasonal infectious diseases, but also more generally for oscillatory social dilemmas: A complex interdependence between behavior and external dynamics emerges. To be effective and to exploit behavioral dynamics, intervention measures to mitigate re-occuring social dilemmas have to be timed carefully.</description>

      <title>Decarbonisation of industry and the energy system: exploring mutual impacts and investment planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decarbonisation of the energy system is crucial for achieving climate goals and is inherently linked to the decarbonisation of industry. Despite this, few studies explore the simultaneous impacts of decarbonising both sectors. This paper aims to examine how industrial decarbonisation in Europe affects the energy system and vice versa. To address this, an industry model incorporating key heavy industry sectors across six European countries is combined with an energy system model for electricity and hydrogen covering fifteen European regions, refered to as the EU-15, divided into eleven zones. The study evaluates various policy scenarios under different conditions.The results demonstrate that industrial decarbonisation leads to a significant increase in electricity and hydrogen demand. This additional demand for electricity is largely met through renewable energy sources, while hydrogen supply is predominantly addressed by blue hydrogen production when fossil fuels are authorized and the system lacks renewable energy. This increased demand results in higher prices with considerable regional disparities. Furthermore, the findings reveal that, regardless of the scenario, the electricity mix in the EU-15 remains predominantly renewable, exceeding 85%.A reduction in carbon taxes lowers the prices of electricity and hydrogen, but does not increase consumption, as the lower carbon tax makes the continued use of fossil fuels more attractive to industry. In scenarios that enforce a phase-out of fossil fuels, electricity prices rise, leading to a greater reliance on imports of low-carbon hydrogen and methanol. Results also suggest that domestic hydrogen production benefits from synergies between electrolytic hydrogen and blue hydrogen, helping to maintain competitive prices.</description>

      <title>Far-right party influence on polarization dynamics in electoral campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political polarization has attracted increasing attention in recent years, driven by the rise of social media and the global emergence of far-right populist movements. This study investigates the dynamics of structural polarization during electoral campaigns in multi-party systems, with a particular focus on the presence of far-right actors and their influence on polarization patterns and hate speech. Using retweet networks as a measure of structural polarization, we analyze two case studies in Spain: the 2022 Andalusia regional elections, where the far-right party Vox was a significant contender, and the 2019 Barcelona city council elections, where the party had no representation. Our results reveal that the presence of a far-right party intensifies polarization, leading to the formation of two distinct ideological blocks aligned along left-right ideological axes, as observed in Andalusia. In contrast, the Catalan independence movement in Barcelona diluted the alignment of voters, resulting in a more complex, multi-axis polarization landscape. We also explore the relationship between polarization and hate speech, finding an anti-correlation between them in both cases. Our findings underscore the significant role of far-right movements in driving political polarization and the nuanced effects of different political contexts on polarization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structure and inference in hypergraphs with node attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networked datasets with units interacting in groups of two or more, encoded with hypergraphs, are accompanied by extra information about nodes, such as the role of an individual in a workplace. Here we show how these node attributes can be used to improve our understanding of the structure resulting from higher-order interactions. We consider the problem of community detection in hypergraphs and develop a principled model that combines higher-order interactions and node attributes to better represent the observed interactions and to detect communities more accurately than using either of these types of information alone. The method learns automatically from the input data the extent to which structure and attributes contribute to explain the data, down weighing or discarding attributes if not informative. Our algorithmic implementation is efficient and scales to large hypergraphs and interactions of large numbers of units. We apply our method to a variety of systems, showing strong performance in hyperedge prediction tasks and in selecting community divisions that correlate with attributes when these are informative, but discarding them otherwise. Our approach illustrates the advantage of using informative node attributes when available with higher-order data.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Bias in Algorithms Used to Disseminate Information in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social connections are conduits through which individuals communicate, information propagates, and diseases spread. Identifying individuals who are more likely to adopt ideas and spread them is essential in order to develop effective information campaigns, maximize the reach of resources, and fight epidemics. Influence maximization algorithms are used to identify sets of influencers. Based on extensive computer simulations on synthetic and ten diverse real-world social networks we show that seeding information using these methods creates information gaps. Our results show that these algorithms select influencers who do not disseminate information equitably, threatening to create an increasingly unequal society. To overcome this issue we devise a multi-objective algorithm which maximizes influence and information equity. Our results demonstrate it is possible to reduce vulnerability at a relatively low trade-off with respect to spread. This highlights that in our search for maximizing information we do not need to compromise on information equality.</description>
