      <title>Short-rate models with stochastic discontinuities: a PDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the reform of interest rate benchmarks, interbank offered rates (IBORs) like LIBOR have been replaced by risk-free rates (RFRs), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the Euro Short-Term Rate (\euro STR) in Europe. These rates exhibit characteristics like jumps and spikes that correspond to specific market events, driven by regulatory and liquidity constraints. To capture these characteristics, this paper considers a general short-rate model that incorporates discontinuities at fixed times with random sizes. Within this framework, we introduce a PDE-based approach for pricing interest rate derivatives and establish, under suitable assumptions, a Feynman-Ka\v{c} representation for the solution. For affine models, we derive (quasi) closed-form solutions, while for the general case, we develop numerical methods to solve the resulting PDEs.</description>

      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this paper formulates the Epstein-Zin preference for discounted dividends received by an investor as an Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We introduce a backward stochastic differential equation with an aggregator integrated with respect to a singular control, prove its well-posedness, and show that it coincides with the Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We then establish that this formulation is equivalent to a robust dividend policy chosen by the firm's executive under the Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. In particular, the robust dividend policy takes the form of a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process, where the threshold level is characterized as the free boundary of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>

      <title>Fitted value iteration methods for bicausal optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a fitted value iteration (FVI) method to compute bicausal optimal transport (OT) where couplings have an adapted structure. Based on the dynamic programming formulation, FVI adopts a function class to approximate the value functions in bicausal OT. Under the concentrability condition and approximate completeness assumption, we prove the sample complexity using (local) Rademacher complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multilayer neural networks with appropriate structures satisfy the crucial assumptions required in sample complexity proofs. Numerical experiments reveal that FVI outperforms linear programming and adapted Sinkhorn methods in scalability as the time horizon increases, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>DeFi Liquidation Risk Modeling Using Geometric Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an analytical method to compute the collateral liquidation probability in decentralized finance (DeFi) stablecoin single-collateral lending. Our approach models the collateral exchange rate as a zero-drift geometric Brownian motion, and derives the probability of it crossing the liquidation threshold. Unlike most existing methods that rely on computationally intensive simulations such as Monte Carlo, our formula provides a lightweight, exact solution. This advancement offers a more efficient alternative for risk assessment in DeFi platforms.</description>
