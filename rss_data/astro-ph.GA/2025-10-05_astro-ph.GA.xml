      <title>No Observational Evidence for Dark Matter Nor a Large Metallicity Spread in the Extreme Milky Way Satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremely-low-luminosity, compact Milky Way satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1 (UMaIII/U1; $L_V = 11 \ L_{\odot}$; $a_{1/2} = 3$ pc) was found to have a substantial velocity dispersion at the time of its discovery ($\sigma_v = 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.0} \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), suggesting that it might be an exceptional, highly dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy with very few stars. However, significant questions remained about the system's dark matter content and nature as a dwarf galaxy due to the small member sample ($N=11$), possible spectroscopic binaries, and the lack of any metallicity information. Here, we present new spectroscopic observations covering $N=16$ members that both dynamically and chemically test UMaIII/U1's true nature. From higher-precision Keck/DEIMOS spectra, we find a 95% confidence level velocity dispersion limit of $\sigma_v&lt; 2.3 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$, with a $\sim$120:1 likelihood ratio now favoring the expected stellar-only dispersion of $\sigma_* \approx 0.1 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ over the original $3.7 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ dispersion. There is now no observational evidence for dark matter in the system. From Keck/LRIS spectra targeting the Calcium II K line, we also measure the first metallicities for 12 member stars, finding a mean metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = -2.65 \; \pm \, 0.1$ (stat.) $\pm \,0.3$ (zeropoint) with a metallicity dispersion limit of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} &lt; 0.35$ dex (at the 95% credible level). Together, these properties are more consistent with UMaIII/U1 being a star cluster, though the dwarf galaxy scenario is not fully ruled out. Under this interpretation, UMaIII/U1 ranks among the most metal-poor star clusters yet discovered and is potentially the first known example of a cluster stabilized by a substantial population of unseen stellar remnants.</description>

      <title>The Entangled Feedback Impacts of Supernovae in Coarse- versus High-Resolution Galaxy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often understood that supernova (SN) feedback in galaxies is responsible for regulating star formation and generating gaseous outflows. However, a detailed look at their effect on the local interstellar medium (ISM) on small mass scales in simulations shows that these processes proceed in clearly distinct channels. We demonstrate this finding in two independent simulations with solar-mass resolution, LYRA and RIGEL, of an isolated dwarf galaxy. Focusing on the immediate environment surrounding SNe, our findings suggest that the large-scale effect of a given SN on the galaxy is best predicted by its immediate local density. Outflows are driven by SNe in diffuse regions expanding to their cooling radii on large (\sim kpc) scales, while dense star-forming regions are disrupted in a localized (\sim pc) manner. However, these separate feedback channels are only distinguishable at very high numerical resolutions capable of following scales &lt;&lt;10^3 \msun. On larger scales, ISM densities are greatly mis-estimated, and differences between local environments of SNe become severely washed out. We demonstrate the practical implications of this effect by comparing with a mid-resolution simulation (Mptcl. \sim 200 \msun) of the same dwarf using the SMUGGLE model. The coarse-resolution simulation cannot self-consistently determine whether a given SN is responsible for generating outflows or suppressing star formation, suggesting that emergent galaxy physics such as star formation regulation through hot-phase outflows is fundamentally unresolvable by subgrid stellar feedback models, without appealing directly to simulations with highly resolved ISM.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Stellar Kinematics in the Central 240 Parsecs of M87 with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 is one of the most well-studied in the local universe, but the stellar- and gas-dynamical SMBH mass measurements disagree. As this galaxy is a key anchor for the upper end of the SMBH mass$-$host galaxy relations, we revisit the central $3''\times 3''$ ($\sim 240\times240$ pc) region of M87 with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We implement several improvements to the reduction pipeline and obtain high signal-to-noise spectra ($S/N \sim 150$) in single $0.''05 $ spaxels across much of the NIRSpec field of view. We measure the detailed shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, parameterized by Gauss-Hermite moments up to $h_8$, in $\sim 2800$ spatial bins, substantially improving upon the prior high angular resolution studies of the M87 stellar kinematics. The NIRSpec data reveal velocities with $V \sim \pm 45$ km s$^{-1}$, velocity dispersions that rise sharply to $\sim$$420$ km s$^{-1}$ at a projected radius of 0.$''$45 (36 pc), and a slight elevation in $h_4$ toward the nucleus. We comprehensively test the robustness of the kinematics, including using multiple velocity template libraries and adopting different polynomials to adjust the template spectra. We find that the NIRSpec stellar kinematics seamlessly transition to recently measured large-scale stellar kinematics from optical Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) IFU data. These combined NIRSpec and KCWI kinematics provide continuous coverage from parsec to kiloparsec scales and will critically constrain future stellar-dynamical models of M87.</description>

      <title>Modeling Emission-Line Surface Brightness in a Multiphase Galactic Wind: An O VI Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast and robust analytic framework for predicting surface brightness (SB) of emission lines in galactic winds as a function of radius up to $\sim 100$ kpc out in the circum-galactic medium. We model multi-phase structure in galactic winds by capturing emission from both the volume-filling hot phase (T $\sim 10^{6-7}$ K) and turbulent radiative mixing layers that host intermediate temperature gas at the boundaries of cold clouds (T $\sim 10^4$ K). Our multi-phase framework makes significantly different predictions of emission signatures compared to traditional single-phase models. We emphasize how ram pressure equilibrium between the cold clouds and hot wind in supersonic outflows, non-equilibrium ionization effects, and energy budgets other than mechanical energy from core-collapse supernovae affect our SB predictions and allow us to better match OVI observations in the literature. Our framework reveals that the optimal galactic wind properties that facilitate OVI emission observations above a detection limit of $\sim 10^{-18} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2} \ arcsec^{-2}}$ are star formation rate surface density $1 \lesssim \dot{\Sigma}_{\ast} \lesssim 20 \ M_{\odot}\ \rm{yr^{-1}\ kpc^{-2}}$, hot phase mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm M,hot} \sim 0.2 - 0.4$, and thermalization efficiency factor $\eta_{\rm E} \gtrsim 0.8$. These findings are consistent with existing observations and can help inform future target selections.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Dynamics and Variability in Open Clusters: Insights from a Comprehensive Analysis of Six Galactic Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kinematic and dynamical analysis of six Galactic open clusters NGC~2204, NGC~2660, NGC~2262, Czernik~32, Pismis~18, and NGC~2437, using \textit{Gaia}~DR3. We used Bayesian and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) methods to identify cluster members, but chose GMM because it's more appropriate for low-mass stars. Estimated distances range from 1.76 to 4.20~kpc and ages from 0.199 to 1.95~Gyr, confirming their intermediate-age nature. King model fits indicate compact morphologies, with core radii of 1--10~arcmin and cluster radii of 5--24~arcmin. We identify 13 BSS and 3 YSS members, whose central concentrations suggest origins via mass transfer or stellar collisions. The mass function slopes (0.96--1.19) are flatter than the Salpeter value, which indicates that these clusters have undergone dynamical mass segregation. Orbit integration within a Galactic potential indicates nearly circular orbits (eccentricities 0.02--0.10), vertical excursions within $\pm$132~pc, and guiding radii near the solar circle, suggesting disk confinement. These clusters likely formed in the thin disk and are shaped by Galactic tidal perturbations, facilitating the rapid loss of low-mass members. Additionally, twelve variable stars were found across four clusters using \textit{TESS} light curves, including $\gamma$~Doradus and SPB pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and a yellow straggler candidate. Periods were derived via Lomb-Scargle analysis. Two eclipsing binaries (TIC~94229743 and TIC~318170024) were modeled using PHOEBE, yielding mass ratios of 1.37 and 2.16, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that integrating orbital dynamics and variable star studies presents valuable insights into the evolutionary pathways of open clusters.</description>

      <title>Impact of AGN and nuclear star formation on the ISM turbulence of galaxies: Insights from JWST/MIRI spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z&lt;0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5--1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the plane of satellites around Milky Way-like galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the Plane of Satellites (PoS) phenomenon may imply a tension with current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology since a Milky-Way (MW)-like PoS is very rare in simulations. In this study, we analyze a large sample of satellite systems of MW-like galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyze their spatial aspect ratio, orbital pole dispersion, Gini coefficient, radial distribution, and bulk satellite velocity relative to the host galaxy. These are compared to the observed Milky~Way PoS. We identified galaxy samples in two mass ranges ($0.1 - 0.8 \times 10^{12} $ M$_\odot$ and $0.8 - 3.0 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$). We find for both mass ranges that only $\sim$ 1 percent of MW-like galaxies contain a PoS similar to that of the MW. Nevertheless, these outliers occur naturally in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We analyze the formation, environment, and evolution of the PoS for nine systems that are most MW-like. We suggest that a PoS can form from one or more of at least five different processes. A massive Magellanic~Cloud (MC)-like satellite is found in 1/3 of the systems and probably plays an important role in the PoS formation. We find a tendency for about half of the satellites to have recently arrived at $z &lt; 0.5$, indicating that a MW-like PoS is a recent and transient phenomenon. We also find that a spin up of the angular momentum amplitude of the most massive satellites is an indicator of the recent in-fall of the PoS satellites.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Characterizing Low Rotation Kinematically Modelled Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the tensions in cosmological models of the Universe lie in the low mass, low velocity regime. Probing this regime requires a statistically significant sample of galaxies with well measured kinematics and robustly measured uncertainties. WALLABY, as a wide area, untargetted HI survey is well positioned to construct this sample. As a first step towards this goal we develop a framework for testing kinematic modelling codes in the low resolution, low $S/N$, low rotation velocity regime. We find that the WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto-Pipeline (WKAPP) is remarkably successful at modelling these galaxies when compared to other algorithms, but, even in idealized tests, there are a significant fraction of false positives found below inclinations of $\approx 40^{\circ}$. We further examine the 11 detections with rotation velocities below $50~\kms$ in the WALLABY pilot data releases. We find that those galaxies with inclinations above $40^{\circ}$ lie within $1-2~\sigma$ of structural scaling relations that require reliable rotation velocity measurements, such as the baryonic Tully Fisher relation. Moreover, the subset that have consistent kinematic and photometric inclinations tend to lie nearer to the relations than those that have inconsistent inclination measures. This work both demonstrates the challenges faced in low-velocity kinematic modelling, and provides a framework for testing modelling codes as well as constructing a large sample of well measured low rotation models from untargetted surveys.</description>

      <title>The origin of the galaxy size-stellar metallicity relation: A semi-analytical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar metallicity encodes the integrated effects of gas inflow, star formation, and feedback-driven outflow, yet its connection to galaxy structure remains poorly understood. Using SDSS-IV MaNGA, we present the direct observational evidence that, at fixed stellar mass, smaller central galaxies are systematically more metal-rich, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient reaching $R_{\rm s}\approx -0.4$. The semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES reproduces this anti-correlation, albeit with a stronger amplitude ($R_{\rm s}\approx -0.8$). Within this framework, the trend cannot be explained by differences in gravitational potential depth or star formation history. Instead, smaller galaxies attain higher stellar metallicities because their elevated star formation efficiencies accelerate chemical enrichment, and, at fixed stellar mass, they inhabit less massive haloes, which makes their recycled inflows more metal-rich. The gas-regulator model demonstrates that star formation efficiency affects stellar metallicity when the system has not long remained in equilibrium, which is shown to be the case for central galaxies with $M_{\rm star}\lesssim 10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ in both L-GALAXIES and observation. The model also suggests a testable signature that, at fixed stellar mass, larger or lower-metallicity galaxies should inhabit more massive haloes than their smaller and higher-metallicity counterparts, providing a direct and testable imprint of the galaxy size-stellar metallicity relation on the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>Foreground Extinction to Extended Celestial Objects - I. New Extinction Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new two-dimensional (2D) map of total Galactic extinction, $A_\mathrm{V}$, across the entire dust half-layer from the Sun to extragalactic space for Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;13$ deg, as well as a three-dimensional (3D) map of $A_\mathrm{V}$ within 2~kpc of the Sun. These maps are based on $A_\mathrm{V}$ and distance estimates derived from a dataset, which utilizes {\it Gaia} Data Release 3 parallaxes and multi-band photometry for nearly 100 million dwarf stars. We apply our own corrections to account for significant systematics in this dataset. Our 2D map achieves an angular resolution of 6.1~arcmin, while the 3D map offers a transverse resolution of 3.56~pc -- corresponding to variable angular resolution depending on distance -- and a radial resolution of 50~pc. In constructing these maps, we pay particular attention to the solar neighborhood (within 200~pc) and to high Galactic latitudes. The 3D map predicts $A_\mathrm{V}$ from the Sun to any extended object within the Galactic dust layer with an accuracy of $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V}) = 0.1$~mag. The 2D map provides $A_\mathrm{V}$ estimates for the entire dust half-layer up to extragalactic distances with an accuracy of $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V}) = 0.07$~mag. We provide $A_\mathrm{V}$ estimates from our maps for various classes of extended celestial objects with angular size primarily in the range of 2--40~arcmin, including 19,809 galaxies and quasars, 170 Galactic globular clusters, 458 open clusters, and several hundreds molecular clouds from two lists. We also present extinction values for 8,293 Type Ia supernovae. Comparison of our extinction estimates with those from previous maps and literature sources reveals systematic differences, indicating large-scale spatial variations in the extinction law and suggesting that earlier 2D reddening maps based on infrared dust emission tend to underestimate low extinction values.</description>

      <title>A Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Young Stellar Objects in the SMC Region NGC 346: JWST Detects Dust, Accretion, Ices and Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of $\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe ($z$$\simeq$2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9$\mu$m and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M$_{\odot}$. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H$_2$ and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10$^{-6}$-2.23x10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a $\sim$30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H$_2$ emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.</description>

      <title>Ultra-strong MgII absorbers trace both inflowing and outflowing gas: insights from dual down-the-barrel and quasar sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Keck/LRIS spectroscopy of seven isolated galaxy--quasar pairs at $0.4 \leq z \leq 0.6$, each exhibiting ultra-strong MgII absorption ($W_{r,2796} \geq 3$ {\AA}), probing both down-the-barrel and transverse gas flows. Down-the-barrel galaxy spectra reveal outflows in three galaxies ($v = 19$ to $311$ km s$^{-1}$) and inflows in five ($v = 61$ to $361$ km s$^{-1}$), including one system showing inflows and outflows simultaneously. All galaxies with detected inflows are below the star-forming main sequence, suggesting that they might be actively replenishing their gas reservoirs. Outflows have a mean covering fraction of $C_{f, \rm out}=0.5$, whereas inflows show a lower average of $C_{f, \rm in}=0.3$. Mass flow rates span $\dot{M}_{\rm in} = 0.01-1.18$ $M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for inflows and $\dot{M}_{\rm out} = 0.23-1.03$ $M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for outflows, yielding mass loading factors below unity and implying these galaxies cannot sustain their current level of star-formation rates. These results are based on the T $\sim 10^4$ K photoionised gas phase traced by MgII; additional accreting/outflowing material in other gas phases may also be present, but remains undetected in this study. Quasar sightlines consistently show redshifted inflow components and blueshifted outflow components, demonstrating that ultra-strong MgII absorbers trace baryon cycling out to impact parameters of $D = 15$ -- 31 kpc. Moreover, the unexpectedly high prevalence of inflows suggests that ultra-strong MgII absorbers offer a powerful strategy for future surveys to systematically map inflow and outflow cycles across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Probing the Low Radio Frequency Emission in PG Quasars with the uGMRT - II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from uGMRT 685 MHz observations of 87 QSOs belonging to the Palomar Green (PG) quasar sample with $z&lt;0.5$. Radio emission is detected in all sources except for 3 radio-quiet (RQ) sources, viz., PG 0043+039, PG 1121+422, and PG 1552+085. The radio-loud (RL) $-$ RQ dichotomy persists at 685 MHz with only 1 source, PG 1216+069, changing its classification from RQ to RL. Approximately 1/3 of the detected RQ quasars display AGN-dominated radio emission while the rest may show additional contributions from stellar-related processes. Consistent with this, the RL and RQ quasars occupy distinct tracks on the `fundamental plane' of black hole activity. We find that RL quasars have $\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1}) &gt; 25.5$, while RQ quasars have ${\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1})} &lt;23.5$. Furthermore, the radio sizes display the RQ$-$RL divide as well with RQ sources typically having sizes $\lesssim30$ kpc, with only 16 ($\sim22$%) RQ sources having sizes between 30 and 100 kpc where there is an overlap with RL quasar sizes. A strong correlation exists between 685 MHz radio luminosity and black hole mass which is tightened when accretion rate is considered, highlighting the important role played by the accretion rate and accretion disk structure in jet production. We found no difference in the minimum-energy magnetic field strengths of the radio cores of RL and RQ quasars; however, different assumptions of source volume and volume filling factors may apply. High-resolution X-ray observations and radio-X-ray flux comparisons are needed to independently test the `magnetic flux paradigm'.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing binaries in globular clusters - predictions for ELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-lensing (SL) represents a powerful technique for detecting compact objects in binary systems through gravitational microlensing effects, when a compact companion transits in front of its luminous partner. We present the first comprehensive study of SL probability within globular cluster (GC) environments, utilizing synthetic stellar populations from MOCCA simulations to predict detection rates for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our analysis incorporates finite-size lens effects for white dwarf (WD) lenses and the specific observational characteristics of the ELT/MICADO instrument. We find that present-day GCs contain 1-50 SL sources with magnifications $\mu_\mathrm{sl} &gt; 1+10^{-8}$, strongly dependent on initial binary fraction, with systems dominated by WD lenses paired with low-mass main-sequence companions. The predicted populations exhibit characteristic bimodal magnitude distributions with peaks at $m \approx 24$ and 32 mag at 10 kpc distance, and typical Einstein ring crossing times of $\tau_\mathrm{eff} \sim 2$ hours. ELT observations should achieve detection efficiency of 0.015-10 sources in $\sim150$ nearby GC after a year of observations depending on distance and survey strategy, with nearby clusters ($D \lesssim 10$ kpc) offering the highest yields. Multi-year monitoring campaigns with daily cadence provide order-of-magnitude improvements over single observations through enhanced photometric precision and increased detection probability. Our results demonstrate that coordinated ELT surveys of Galactic GCs represent a viable approach for probing hidden binary populations and compact object demographics in dense stellar environments, with comprehensive programs potentially yielding up to 10-100 well-characterized SL sources after first 5 years of observations suitable for statistical studies of binary evolution in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Wide-field GMRT imaging of X-shaped Radio-Galaxies: Spectral properties of 4C32.25 and 4C61.23</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present wide-field upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) images of the fields around the X-shaped radio-galaxies (XRGs) 4C32.25, 4C61.23, and MRC 2011-298 obtained at 400 MHz. The observations are calibrated using the extreme peeling method to account for direction-dependent effects across the field of view, as previously applied to Low-frequency array (LOFAR) data. Our 400 MHz images capture in fine detail the radio-morphology of the XRGs, as well as other serendipitous radio-sources located in these fields. We use these images along with archival low-frequencyand high-frequency radio data to investigate the spectral properties of the XRGs 4C32.25 and 4C61.23. Under the assumption of conditions corresponding to the maximum radio-source age, we estimate the spectral ages of both the primary lobes and the wings. These ages indicate that the wings are the oldest component of the XRGs and are a product of past radio activity. Moreover, we have used the radio images available to derive high-resolution spectral index maps for these two XRGs. We find that the spectral index steepens from the primary lobes towards the wings, consistent with our spectral age estimates. These results suggest that precessional and backflow models explain the X-shaped radio-morphology of 4C32.25 and 4C61.23, respectively. Finally, taking advantage of our wide-area images, we identify several serendipitous diffuse radio-sources located in our XRG fields and cross-reference them with previous surveys.</description>

      <title>A $z\simeq0.4$ Little Red Dot analog: An Extended Starburst with an Overmassive Black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z &gt; 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 Msun, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.</description>

      <title>Dust scattering halo of 4U 1630-47: High resolution X-ray and mm observations constrain source and molecular cloud distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-investigated the distance to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 by analyzing its dust scattering halo (DSH) using high-resolution X-ray (Chandra) and millimeter (APEX) observations. Dust scattering halos form when X-rays from a compact source are scattered by interstellar dust, creating diffuse ring-like structures that can provide clues about the source's distance. Our previous work suggested two possible distances: 4.9 kpc and 11.5 kpc, but uncertainties remained due to low-resolution CO maps. We developed a new methodology to refine these estimates, starting with a machine learning approach to determine a 3D representation of molecular clouds from the APEX dataset. The 3D maps are combined with X-ray flux measurements to generate synthetic DSH images. By comparing synthetic images with the observed Chandra data through radial and azimuthal profile fitting, we not only measure the source distance but also distinguish whether the molecular clouds are at their near or far distances. The current analysis again supported a distance of 11.5 kpc over alternative estimates. While the method produced a lower reduced chi-squared for both the azimuthal and radial fits for a distance of 13.6 kpc, we ruled it out as it would have produced a bright ring beyond the APEX field of view, which is not seen in the Chandra image. The 4.85 kpc estimate was also excluded due to poor fit quality and cloud distance conflicts. The systematic error of 1 kpc, arising from uncertainties in determining molecular cloud distances, dominates the total error.</description>

      <title>HR-pyPopStar II: high spectral resolution evolutionary synthesis models low metallicity expansion and the properties of the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low metallicity stellar populations are very abundant in the Universe, either as the remnants of the past history of the Milky Way or similar spiral galaxies, or the young low metallicity stellar populations that are being observed in the local dwarf galaxies or in the high-z objects with low metal content recently found with JWST. Our goal is to develop new high-spectral-resolution models tailored for low-metallicity environments and apply them to analyse stellar population data, particularly in cases where a significant portion of the stellar content exhibits low metallicity. Methods. We used the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis code HR-pyPopStar with available stellar libraries to create a new set of models focused on low metallicity stellar populations. We have compared the new spectral energy distributions with the previous models of HR-pyPopStar for solar metallicity. Once we verified that the spectra, except for the oldest ages that show some differences in the molecular bands of the TiO and G band, are similar, we reanalysed the high resolution data from the globular cluster M 15 by finding a better estimate of its age and metallicity. Finally, we analysed a subsample of mostly star-forming dwarf galaxies from the MaNGA survey we found similar stellar mass-mean stellar metallicity weighted by light to other studies that studied star forming dwarf galaxies and slightly higher mean stellar metallicity than the other works that analysed all types of dwarf galaxies at the same time, but are within error bars.</description>

      <title>A quest for sulfur-bearing refractory species. Identification of CaS in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of refractory molecules in massive star-forming regions provides a means of probing the innermost regions of disks around massive stars. These detections also make it possible to explore the chemical composition of refractories through gas-phase observations. In this regard, identifying refractory compounds containing sulfur could reveal potential connections between sulfur and refractories, as well as help determine the sulfur budget in these extreme environments. We find convincing evidence of a reliable detection of CaS, and tentative detections of KS and KSH in the disk G351.77-mm1. These are the first ever identifications of these species in the interstellar medium. The CaS, KS, and KSH column densities are about 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of the abundant sulfur compounds SO$_2$, CH$_3$SH and SiS, proving that these species are not the major reservoir of sulfur at the spatial scales probed by our observations. Higher angular resolution observations at different wavelengths are required to confirm these detections, which are of paramount importance to gain insights into the formation of gas-phase refractory molecules.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution timescales for the supermassive black hole system in the galaxy NGC 7727 (Arp 222)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A dual active galactic nucleus candidate with a separation of only 500 pc was recently found in NGC 7727. According to the hierarchical merging scenario, such objects would be expected to merge on a timescale of a few hundred Myr. However, estimating the accurate merging timescales for the two nuclei is still a complex challenge. Aims. Using our numerical N-body code, we can trace the full evolution of central black holes during all phases: dynamical friction of unbound black holes, binary black hole formation, hardening of the system due to two-body scattering, and emission of gravitational waves leading to the final merger. Methods. Our model has next components: the bulge contains two dense stellar nuclei, each of which hosts a black hole. The most massive black hole in the center of the galaxy has a mass of 1.54x10^8 Msol and the least massive black hole in the offset second stripped nucleus has a mass of 6.33x10^6 Msol. We followed the dynamical evolution of the system up to a final separation of four Schwarzschild radii. The black holes were added as special relativistic particles and their equation of motion contains a full post-Newtonian approximation - 2.5 term. Results. Initially, the black holes are not gravitationally bound and, thus, the system spends more than 60 Myr in the phase of dynamical friction while tightening the orbit. The two-body scattering phase takes place from 60 Myr up to 120 Myr. In the last 10 Myr, the black hole's separation is seen to be rapidly shrinking due to the gravitational wave emission. Starting from the physical separation observed today, the total merging time in our model is 130 (10) Myr. Conclusions. These results have implications for the statistics of strong sources of gravitational waves at low frequencies, namely, systems engaged in an advanced state of are expected to be prime sources for the LISA mission to observe.</description>

      <title>The intracluster light analysis of the most evolved systems of galaxies: fossil groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the intracluster light (ICL) in three fossil groups (FG), RXJ085640.72+055347.36, RX J1136+0713, and RX J1410+4145, at z ~ 0.1. We used two optical broad-band filters, F435W and F606W, observed with the Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopic data obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to generate the ICL maps and measure the ICL fraction using CICLE, an algorithm developed to disentangle the ICL from the light of galaxies. We found ICL fractions of 9.9% - 14.4%, 3.8% - 6.1%, and 4.7% - 10.7% for RXJ0856, RXJ1136, and RXJ1410, respectively. This behavior is not consistent with the presence of the ICL fraction excess previously observed in merging clusters and also inconsistent with the constant ICL fraction distribution characteristic of relaxed systems, although the values found are within the typical range expected for the latter. Instead, they show a significantly increasing trend with wavelengths over ~ 3800 - 5500A, indicating that fossil groups are indeed old and undisturbed systems, even compared with regular relaxed clusters.</description>

      <title>Probing the formation of megaparsec-scale giant radio galaxies II. Continuum &amp; polarization behavior from MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03037</link>

Abstract: The persistence of radiative signatures in giant radio galaxies remains a frontier topic of research, with contemporary telescopes revealing intricate features that require investigation. This study aims to examine the emission characteristics of simulated GRGs, and correlate them with their underlying 3D dynamical properties. Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz were computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized emissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to reflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from these RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different locations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are strongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features like wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial indicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in GRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary structures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr. High-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon distances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the interpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the lateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source's state, with a gradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage. This study highlights that applying a simple radio power-jet power relation to a statistical GRG sample is unfeasible, as it depends on growth conditions of individual GRGs. Effects such as inverse-Compton CMB cooling and matter entrainment significantly impact the long-term emission persistence of GRGs. The diminishing fractional polarization with GRG evolution reflects increasing turbulence in the cocoon.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the radio-star formation correlation on kpc scales. IV. Radio halos of highly-inclined Virgo cluster spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to the radio continuum emission of the thin galactic disk, vertically extended emission is ubiquitous in starforming disk galaxies. This halo emission can represent an important fraction of the total emission of the galaxy The cosmic ray electrons (CRe) responsible for the radio continuum emission are produced within the thin disk and transported into the halo. We made an attempt to reconstruct the radial properties of radio continuum halos in nearly edge-on galaxies where the star formation rate (SFR) distribution can be deprojected and the vertical radio continuum emission is well distinct from the disk emission. The deprojected SFR distribution is convolved with a Gaussian kernel to take CRe diffusion within the galactic disk into account and a vertical profile of the radio continuum emissivity is added to the disk emission. The three-dimensional emission distribution is then projected on the sky and compared to VLA radio continuum observations at 20 and 6 cm. We found that overall the halo emission contains information on the underlying distribution of the star formation rate. The majority of our galaxies show flaring radio continuum halos. Except for one galaxy, our Virgo galaxies follow the trend of increasing effective height with increasing radio continuum size found by the CHANG-ES collaboration. We confirm that radio continuum halos can represent a significant fraction of the total radio continuum emission of a starforming spiral galaxy. At 20 cm and 6 cm between 30 and 70 of the total radio continuum emission originate in the halo. We propose a halo classification based on the height ratio and SI between 20 and 6cm. If we interpret the vertical structures of the large-scale magnetic field within the disk-halo and halo types as a sign of a galactic outflow or wind, all galaxies except one most probably harbor an advection-dominated halo.</description>

      <title>On the origin of counterrotating stellar disks in TNG50. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding galaxy evolution is key to explaining the structures we observe in the present-day Universe. Counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs), i.e. co-spatial stellar disks rotating with opposite angular momentum, have been proposed as signatures of past accretion events. Therefore, they constitute potentially valuable tracers of galactic assembly. We aim to investigate the properties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central late-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\rm tot} \approx 10^{12}$, $D/T&gt;0.5$, $N_{\rm star}&gt;10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar particles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity $\epsilon &lt; -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main disk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star formation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host significant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\% of the total stellar mass of the disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from observations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\%), in-situ dominated (i.e.73\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often coincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations are able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD's star population is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways can lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth accretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare but diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the accretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow, suggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy's past accretion history.</description>

      <title>SIGNALS of Giant HII Regions: A Spatially Resolved Analysis of NGC 604</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing giant HII regions at fine spatial scales uncovers detailed structures and reveals variations in ionization, abundance, and dynamical properties of ionized gas and the effect of stellar feedback. Using emission line data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the principal optical emission line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous HII region in M33. The excitation maps align well with the H$\alpha$ morphology and are clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and secondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show substantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these variations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily caused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios. We present the H$\alpha$ kinematics of the region and connect it to the excitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial distribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these excitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary nebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the overall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution spatial data. Throughout the paper, we make comparisons to and raise concerns about single-aperture and long-slit spectroscopic measurements of giant HII regions, highlighting the limitations and potential inaccuracies of such methods.</description>

      <title>Inferring Stellar Densities with Flexible Models I: The Distribution of RR Lyrae in the Milky Way with $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way requires detailed mapping of its stellar components, which preserve fossil records of the Galaxy's assembly through cosmic time. RR Lyrae stars are particularly well-suited for this endeavor, as they are old, standard candle variables that probe the Galaxy's earliest formation epochs. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the three-dimensional density distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way. This approach provides a flexible framework for modeling complex stellar distributions, particularly in the inner Galaxy where the bulge, disk, and halo components overlap. Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by a distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.30. Consistent with previous work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that flattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is oblate ($q$=0.62) with a tilt angle of $12.22^{\circ}$. We report for the first time that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results establish GMMs as an effective and flexible tool for modeling Galactic structure and provide new constraints on the distribution of old stars in the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Robust magnetic field estimates in star-forming galaxies with the equipartition formula in the absence of equipartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equipartition model is widely used to estimate magnetic field strength from synchrotron intensity in radio galaxies, yet the validity of its underlying assumptions remains uncertain. Using an Arepo simulation which incorporates a two-moment cosmic ray (CR) transport scheme and a multiphase interstellar medium, we compare magnetic fields inferred from synthetic synchrotron emission maps with the true fields in the simulation. Starting from the derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between the equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only weakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density. In practice, for both face-on and edge-on projections, the equipartition model slightly overestimates the total synchrotron-weighted magnetic field with mean offsets of 32% (0.17 dex) and 36% (0.2 dex), even though the energy equipartition does not hold locally. Beyond these average offsets, a clear trend emerges in edge-on projections that the model underestimates the field in the disk and overestimates it in the halo. Our results demonstrate that the validity of the equipartition model depends only weakly on the strict fulfillment of energy equipartition, and that the equipartition model remains a practical method for estimating magnetic field strengths in face-on projection maps based on our CR-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS): Clustering properties of CRS BG and LRG target catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS) will obtain nearly 5.4 million spectroscopic redshifts over $\sim5700$\,deg$^2$ to map large-scale structure and enable measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), growth rates via redshift-space distortions, and cross-correlations with weak-lensing surveys. We validate the target selections, photometry, masking, systematics and redshift distributions of the CRS Bright Galaxy (BG) and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) target catalogues selected from DESI Legacy Surveys DR10.1 imaging. We measure the angular two-point correlation function, test masking strategies, and recover redshift distributions via cross-correlation with DESI DR1 spectroscopy. For BG, we adopt Legacy Survey \texttt{MASKBITS} that veto bright stars, SGA large galaxies, and globular clusters; for LRG, we pair these with an unWISE W1 artefact mask. These choices suppress small-scale excess power without imprinting large-scale modes. A Limber-scaling test across BG $r$-band magnitude slices shows that, after applying the scaling, the $w(\theta)$ curves collapse to a near-common power law over the fitted angular range, demonstrating photometric uniformity with depth and consistency between the North (NGC) and South (SGC) Galactic Caps. Cross-correlations with DESI spectroscopy recover the expected $N(z)$, with higher shot noise at the brightest magnitudes. For LRGs, angular clustering in photo-$z$ slices ($0.4\le z&lt;1.0$) is mutually consistent between the DECaLS and DES footprints at fixed $z$ and is well described by an approximate power law once photo-$z$ smearing is accounted for; halo-occupation fits yield results consistent with recent LRG studies. Together, these tests indicate that the masks and target selections yield uniform clustering statistics, supporting precision large-scale structure analyses with 4MOST CRS.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic History of Stellar Encounters with Beta Pictoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beta Pictoris is an A-type star hosting a complex planetary system with two massive gas giants and a prominent debris disk. Variable absorption lines in its stellar spectrum have been interpreted as signatures of exocomets (comet-like bodies transiting the star). Stellar flybys can gravitationally perturb objects in the outer comet reservoir, altering their orbits and potentially injecting them into the inner system, thereby triggering exocomet showers.
  We aim to assess the contribution of stellar flybys to the observed exocomet activity by reconstructing the stellar encounter history of beta Pictoris in the past and future.
  We used Gaia DR3 data, supplemented with radial velocities from complementary spectroscopic surveys, to compile a catalogue of stars currently within 80 pc of beta Pictoris. Their orbits were integrated backward and forward in time in an axisymmetric Galactic potential (Gala package) to identify encounters within 2 pc of the system.
  We identified 99 416 stars within 80 pc of beta Pictoris at present with resolved kinematics. Among these, 49 stars (including the eight components of five binaries) encounter beta Pictoris within 2 pc between -1.5 Myr and +2 Myr. For four of the binaries, the centre-of-mass trajectories also pass within 2 pc. We estimate the sample to be more than 60 % complete within 0.5 Myr of the present.
  Despite beta Pictoris being the eponym of its famous moving group, none of the identified encounters involved its moving group members; all are unrelated field stars. We find no encounter capable of shaping observed disc structures, although stellar flybys may contribute to the long-term evolution of a potential Oort Cloud. Our catalogue constitutes the most complete reconstruction of the beta Pictoris encounter history to date and provides a robust foundation for future dynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>microJAX: A Differentiable Framework for Microlensing Modeling with GPU-Accelerated Image-Centered Ray Shooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce microJAX, the first fully differentiable implementation of the image-centered ray-shooting (ICRS) algorithm for gravitational microlensing. Built on JAX and its XLA just-in-time compiler, microJAX exploits GPU parallelism while providing exact gradients through automatic differentiation. The current release supports binary- and triple-lens geometries, including limb-darkened extended-source effects, and delivers magnifications that remain differentiable for all model parameters. Benchmarks show that microJAX matches the accuracy of established packages and attains up to a factor of $\sim$5-6 speed-up in the small-source, limb-darkened regime on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Since the model is fully differentiable, it integrates seamlessly with probabilistic programming frameworks, enabling scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference workflows. Although the present work focuses on standard microlensing magnification models, the modular architecture is designed to support upcoming implementations of microlensing higher-order effects, while remaining compatible with external likelihood frameworks that incorporate advanced noise models. microJAX thus provides a robust foundation for precise and large-scale surveys anticipated in the coming decade, including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, where scalable, physically self-consistent inference will be essential for maximizing scientific return.</description>

      <title>Missing Beats: Dark Matter Silences Short-Period Cepheids in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming near-infrared facilities (e.g., JWST/NIRCam, ELT/MICADO) will dramatically increase the detectability of galactic center Cepheids despite extreme extinction at optical wavelengths. In this work, we study the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on Cepheid stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way. We show that at densities $\rho \sim 10^5 \, \text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$, blue-loop evolution can be suppressed, preventing the formation of low-mass ($3$-$6 \, M_\odot$) short-period ($1$-$6$ days) Cepheids. A dearth of such variables could provide indirect evidence for DM heating. Notably, this effect occurs at lower DM densities than required to impact main-sequence stars. Future surveys will thus offer a novel, complementary probe of DM properties in galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by a spiral galaxy I: the influence from bar's structure to the flux ratio anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lens flux ratio anomalies are a powerful probe of small-scale mass structures within lens galaxies. These anomalies are often attributed to dark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a significant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common feature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic analysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga cosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of these galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields smooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating numerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the flux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical cusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars, we use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region. Our primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even Fourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole components show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with Spearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order of 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are highly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We conclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic bar's complex morphology. Failing to account for a bar's complex morphology can lead to a misinterpretation of the lensing signature, potentially causing an overestimation of the dark matter subhalo population.</description>

Abstract: We report the detection of HCN ($J=3-2$) rotational emission from comet 3I/ATLAS at a heliocentric distance of 2.13 AU with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Observations were conducted from 07 August 2025 (UT) using the $^{\prime}\overline U^{\prime}\overline u$ heterodyne receiver and ACSIS spectroscopic backend. The HCN line was detected at $&gt;5\sigma$ on 14 Sep 2025 (UT) and a production rate of $Q({\rm HCN})=(4.0\pm1.7)\times10^{25}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$ was derived by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Preliminary estimates of the HCN/H$_2$O and CN/HCN abundance ratios suggest values similar to Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>Rapid onset of a Comptonisation zone in the repeating tidal disruption event XMMSL2 J140446.9-251135</title>

Abstract: We report here on observations of a tidal disruption event, XMMSL2 J1404-2511, discovered in an XMM-Newton slew, in a quiescent galaxy at z=0.043. X-ray monitoring covered the epoch when the accretion disc transitioned from a thermal state, with kT~80 eV, to a harder state dominated by a warm, optically-thick corona. The bulk of the coronal formation took place within 7 days and was coincident with a temporary drop in the emitted radiation by a factor 4. After a plateau phase of ~100 days, the X-ray flux of XMMSL2 J1404-2511 decayed by a factor 500 within 230 days. We estimate the black hole mass in the galaxy to be $M_{BH}=4\pm{2}\times10^{6}$ solar masses and the peak X-ray luminosity $L_{X}\sim6\times10^{43}$ ergs/s. The optical/UV light curve is flat over the timescale of the observations with $L_{opt}\sim 2\times10^{41}$ ergs/s. We find that TDEs with coronae are more often found in an X-ray sample than in an optically-selected sample. Late-time monitoring of the optical sample is needed to test whether this is an intrinsic property of TDEs or is due to a selection effect. From the fast decay of the X-ray emission we consider that the event was likely due to the partial stripping of an evolved star rather than a full stellar disruption, an idea supported by the detection of two further re-brightening episodes, two and four years after the first event, in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey.</description>

      <title>Photometric Analysis of 30 Contact Binaries in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M31, as the largest galaxy in the Local Group, is of significant importance for the study of stellar formation and evolution. Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (\citeyear{2024ApJS..273....9G}), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent model of cosmic ray penetration into molecular clouds: Effect of energy losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of cosmic-ray (CR) penetration into dense molecular clouds developed recently for relativistic particles by Chernyshov et al. (2024) is extended to non-relativistic CRs. Interstellar CRs streaming into the clouds are able to resonantly excite MHD waves in diffuse cloud envelopes. This leads to the self-modulation, such that streaming particles are scattered at the self-generated waves. In contrast to relativistic CRs, transport of lower-energy particles in the envelopes is generally heavily affected by ionization losses; furthermore, both CR protons and electrons contribute to wave excitation. We show that these effects have profound impact on the self-modulation, and can dramatically reduce CR spectra even for clouds with moderate column densities of a few times $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Nearest Ancient Sloshing Cold Front in the Sky with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Virgo Cluster is the nearest cool core cluster that features two well-studied sloshing cold fronts at radii of $r \approx 30$ kpc and $r \approx 90$ kpc, respectively. In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic observations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \approx 250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely to be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison with a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these cold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49 from the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the south. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the disturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness profiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas the western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies that magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while its western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the X-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the cold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our findings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of the intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important implications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such as the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing ancient cold fronts.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inference of the Structure and Orbit of Milky Way Satellites with Semi-Analytic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-analytic modeling furnishes an efficient avenue for characterizing the properties of dark matter halos associated with satellites of Milky Way-like systems, as it easily accounts for uncertainties arising from halo-to-halo variance, the orbital disruption of satellites, baryonic feedback, and the stellar-to-halo mass (SMHM) relation. We use the SatGen semi-analytic satellite generator -- which incorporates both empirical models of the galaxy-halo connection in the field as well as analytic prescriptions for the orbital evolution of these satellites after they enter a host galaxy -- to create large samples of Milky Way-like systems and their satellites. By selecting satellites in the sample that match the observed properties of a particular dwarf galaxy, we can then infer arbitrary properties of the satellite galaxy within the Cold Dark Matter paradigm. For the Milky Way's classical dwarfs, we provide inferred values (with associated uncertainties) for the maximum circular velocity $v_{max}$ and the radius $r_{max}$ at which it occurs, varying over two choices of feedback model and two prescriptions for the SMHM relation that populate dark matter halos with physically distinct galaxies. While simple empirical scaling relations can recover the median inferred value for $v_{max}$ and $r_{max}$, this approach provides realistic correlated uncertainties and aids interpretability through variation of the model. For these different models, we also demonstrate how the internal properties of a satellite's dark matter profile correlate with its orbit, and we show that it is difficult to reproduce observations of the Fornax dwarf without strong baryonic feedback. The technique developed in this work is flexible in its application of observational data and can leverage arbitrary information about the satellite galaxies to make inferences about their dark matter halos and population statistics.</description>

      <title>Galaxy mass profiles with convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies is particularly challenging due to projection effects and the unknown shape of their velocity anisotropy profile. Our goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of recovering dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies from line-of-sight stellar data. Traditionally, this task relies on time-consuming methods that require profile parameterization and assume dynamical equilibrium and spherical symmetry. We train a convolutional neural network model using various sets of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. By extracting projected stellar data from the simulated galaxies and feeding it into the model, we obtain the posterior distribution of the dynamical mass profile at ten different radii. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of existing literature mass estimators on our dataset. Our model achieves more accurate results than any literature mass estimator while also providing enclosed mass estimates at radii where no previous estimators exist. We confirm that the posterior distributions produced by the model are well-calibrated, ensuring they provide meaningful uncertainties. However, issues remain, as the method loses performance when trained on one set of simulations and applied to another, highlighting the importance of improving the generalization of ML methods trained on specific galaxy simulations.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). A probabilistic classification of quenched galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating what drives the quenching of star formation in galaxies is key to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of galaxies, and enable precise measurements of their star formation histories. Using the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic classification framework that combines the average specific star-formation rate inferred over two timescales ($10^8,10^9$ yr) to categorise galaxies as `ageing' (secularly evolving), `quenched' (recently halted star formation), or `retired' (dominated by old stars). Two classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, which integrates posterior distributions, and a model-driven method, which optimises sample purity and completeness using IllustrisTNG. At $z&lt;0.1$ and $M_\ast \gtrsim 3\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72\%, 8-17\%, and 14-19\% for ageing, quenched, and retired populations, respectively. Ageing and retired galaxies dominate at the low- and high-mass end, respectively, while quenched galaxies surpass the retired fraction for $M_\ast \lesssim 10^{10}\,\rm M_\odot$. The evolution with redshift shows increasing and decreasing fractions of ageing and retired galaxies, respectively. More massive galaxies usually undergo quenching episodes at earlier times than to their low-mass counterparts. In terms of the mass-size-metallicity relation, ageing galaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired galaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while quenched galaxies form an intermediate population that is more compact and chemically evolved than ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential for elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Core collapse in resonant self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.</description>

Abstract: The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer-like density profile. However, most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \texttt{Torch} framework, integrating the \texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into \texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics. We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total mass of $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$, investigating the effects of varying numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of $0.55\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) the final stellar density profile is more centrally concentrated than analytically predicted, reflecting the role of global gas collapse and feedback; (2) sub-clusters can initially form even in centrally concentrated gas clouds; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models of local fragmentation and star formation; and (4) the mass of the most massive star formed is directly correlated with the cluster effective radius and inversely correlated with the velocity dispersion, while the duration of star formation correlates with the star formation efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.</description>

      <title>Pressure Regulated Formation of Molecular Clouds and Stars: The case of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a steady-state analytical model for pressure-regulated formation of molecular clouds (MC) and stars (SF) in gaseous galactic disks and apply it to the Milky Way (MW). MC formation depends on midplane interstellar pressure $P_{\text{ISM}}$ and metallicity $Z$, and for galactocentric distances $R\gtrsim5$ kpc, $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ scales approximately linearly with molecular gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm mol}(R)$. The molecularization of the cold neutral medium (CNM) is due to the opacity of small dust grains that protect the center of the cloud from dissociating radiation when the column density is $\Sigma_d\geq 5\ (Z_\odot/Z)M_\odot\text{ pc}^{-2}$. The H$_2$ formation rate per hydrogen atom is $F\sim10^{-15}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)T_{100}^{-1/2}\text{s}^{-1}$, and the corresponding formation rate per unit area is $\dot{\Sigma}^{+}_{\rm mol}\sim 5\times10^{-2}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/{P_\odot}\right)T_{100}^{-1/2}M_\odot~\text{kpc}^{-2}~\text{yr}^{-1}$, where $P_\odot$ is the pressure at the solar circle and $T_{100}=T/100\text{ K}$ is the temperature of the cloud. In equilibrium, this equals the molecular gas destruction rate $\dot{\Sigma}^{-}_{\rm mol}$ due to SF. Self-gravity sets in when the column density of a cloud reaches $\Sigma_{\rm sg}=\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)^{1/2}$, with $\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}\sim30\ M_\odot\ \text{pc}^{-2}$. Given the distribution of $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ and $Z(R)$ in the MW, the SF process at $5\lesssim R\lesssim11$ kpc follows a two-step track: first, MCs form from CNM gas and then they form stars when self-gravity sets in. The resulting SFR surface density is $\Sigma_\text{SFR}(R)\approx (1.6-4)\times10^{-3}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot\right)\ \text{M}_\odot~\text {kpc}^{-2}\text{yr}^{-1}$ with an average final SF efficiency of $\epsilon_{\rm sf}\sim (3-8)\times 10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda&gt;1500$ {\AA} continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive radio study of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were originally classified as sources with little to no radio emission. Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144~MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4~GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4~GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3~GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\sim40\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144~MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the NLS1 galaxy population in radio and lays the foundation for targeted future studies.</description>

      <title>Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>An excess of luminous white dwarfs in the peculiar Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) NGC 2808 by using deep near-UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and theoretical models, to investigate if this cluster hosts an excess of WDs. Excess in WDs is a rare phenomenon that has been found to exist only in a few GGCs. We compared star counts from different evolutionary phases on the near-UV color-magnitude diagram to evolutionary times predicted by BaSTI models. The investigation was carried out over a region within a radii of 1.5 $\arcmin$ of the cluster center and a region of similar dimension located 5$\arcmin$ away. We find a WD excess of $\approx$ 60 - 70\% when comparing star counts and evolutionary models of the WD cooling sequence to the main-sequence turn-off, and by using different values and fractions of Helium enhancement. This excess decreases to $\approx$ 30 - 40\% when the WD cooling sequence is compared to the horizontal branch. The WD excess is slightly larger in the internal field that covers the cluster center; however, the difference with the external field is compatible within the uncertainties. We argue that this excess is possibly related to the existence of SCWDs and Helium-core WDs in NGC~2808, and might be directly associated to the extended blue horizontal branch of this GGC.</description>

      <title>13 Billion Years of MgII Absorber Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying "apportioned integrals," we use dN/dX measurements to determine the MgII absorber equivalent width distribution function for Wr &gt; 0.03 [angstroms] and 0 &lt; z &lt; 7. Adopting a Schechter distribution, f(z,W)dW = Phi* (W/W*)^alpha e^{-W/W*} dW/W*, we present the normalization, Phi*(z), the characteristic equivalent width, W*(z), and the weak-end slope, alpha(z), as smooth functions of redshift. Measurements of dN/dX are robust for z &lt; 4 but less so at z &gt; 4 for weaker absorbers (Wr &lt; 0.3 [angstroms]). We bracketed two data-driven scenarios: from z ~ 7 to z ~ 4, dN/dX of weak absorbers is (1) constant, or (2) decreasing. For scenario #1, the evolution of Phi*(z), W*(z), and alpha(z) show that in the post-reionization universe, weak systems are nonevolving while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the strongest absorbers slowly evolve away while the incidence of weak absorbers rapidly increases. For scenario #2, the parameter evolution is such that, in the post-reionization universe, weak systems evolve away while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the behavior tracks the same as scenario #1. We argue in favor of scenario #2 based on corroborating OI, CII, and SiII measurements at z &gt; 4. Our results provide a unified, quantitative description for MgII absorber evolution spanning 13 billion years of cosmic time and offer deeper insights into galactic baryon cycle physics. They also highlight the need for deep z &gt; 5 MgII surveys and have implications for detectability of a MgII forest at z &gt; 7.</description>
