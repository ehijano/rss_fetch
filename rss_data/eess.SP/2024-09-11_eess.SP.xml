      <title>Analog Beamforming Aided by Full-Dimension One-Bit Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of analog beamforming at the receiver in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, aided by full digital chains featuring 1-bit ADCs. We advocate utilizing these full digital chains to facilitate rapid channel estimation and beam acquisition for subsequent communication, even without prior knowledge of the training pilots. To balance energy consumption and implementation costs, we opt for 1-bit ADCs. We propose a two-stage maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm to estimate angles of arrival (AoAs) and facilitate the design of analog beamforming to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We validate our proposed beamforming schemes in narrowband coherent channels through synthetic testing and in wideband coherent channels, particularly under the 3GPP clustered-delay-line (CDL)-C channel model.</description>

      <title>Five Key Enablers for Communication during and after Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Civilian communication during disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and military conflicts is crucial for saving lives. Nevertheless, several challenges exist during these circumstances such as the destruction of cellular communication and electricity infrastructure, lack of line of sight (LoS), and difficulty of localization under the rubble. In this article, we discuss key enablers that can boost communication during disasters, namely, satellite and aerial platforms, redundancy, silencing, and sustainable networks aided with wireless energy transfer (WET). The article also highlights how these solutions can be implemented in order to solve the failure of communication during disasters. Finally, it sheds light on unresolved challenges, as well as future research directions.</description>

      <title>Downlink Beamforming for Cell-Free ISAC: A Fast Complex Oblique Manifold Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) systems are just emerging as an interesting technique for future communications. Such a system comprises several multiple-antenna access points (APs), serving multiple single-antenna communication users and sensing targets. However, efficient beamforming designs that achieve high precision and robust performance in densely populated networks are lacking. This paper proposes a new beamforming algorithm by exploiting the inherent Riemannian manifold structure. The aim is to maximize the communication sum rate while satisfying sensing beampattern gains and per AP transmit power constraints. To address this constrained optimization problem, a highly efficient augmented Lagrangian model-based iterative manifold optimization for CF-ISAC (ALMCI) algorithm is developed. This algorithm exploits the geometry of the proposed problem and uses a complex oblique manifold. Conventional convex-concave procedure (CCPA) and multidimensional complex quadratic transform (MCQT)-CSA algorithms are also developed as comparative benchmarks. The ALMCI algorithm significantly outperforms both of these. For example, with 16 APs having 12 antennas and 30 dBm transmit power each, our proposed ALMCI algorithm yields 22.7% and 6.7% sum rate gains over the CCPA and MCQT-CSA algorithms, respectively. In addition to improvement in communication capacity, the ALMCI algorithm achieves superior beamforming gains and reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Robust Square Root Unscented Kalman filter of graph signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the problem of nonlinear and non-gaussian filtering of the graph signal, in this paper, a robust square root unscented Kalman filter based on graph signal processing is proposed. The algorithm uses a graph topology to generate measurements and an unscented transformation is used to obtain the priori state estimates. In addition, in order to enhance the numerical stability of the unscented Kalman filter, the algorithm combines the double square root decomposition method to update the covariance matrix in the graph frequency domain. Furthermore, to handle the non-Gaussian noise problem in the state estimation process, an error augmentation model is constructed in the graph frequency domain by unifying the measurement error and state error, which utilizes the Laplace matrix of the graph to effectively reduce the cumulative error at each vertex. Then the general robust cost function is adopted as the optimal criterion to deal with the error, which has more parameter options so that effectively suppresses the problems of random outliers and abnormal measurement values in the state estimation process. Finally, the convergence of the error of the proposed algorithm is firstly verified theoretically, and then the robustness of the proposed algorithm is verified by experimental simulation.</description>

      <title>Symbol Level Precoding for Systems with Improper Gaussian Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on precoding design in multi-antenna systems with improper Gaussian interference (IGI), characterized by correlated real and imaginary parts. We first study block level precoding (BLP) and symbol level precoding (SLP) assuming the receivers apply a pre-whitening filter to decorrelate and normalize the IGI. We then shift to the scenario where the base station (BS) incorporates the IGI statistics in the SLP design, which allows the receivers to employ a standard detection algorithm without pre-whitenting. Finally we address the case where the channel and statistics of the IGI are unknown, and we formulate robust BLP and SLP designs that minimize the worst case performance in such settings. Interestingly, we show that for BLP, the worst-case IGI is in fact proper, while for SLP the worst case occurs when the interference signal is maximally improper, with fully correlated real and imaginary parts. Numerical results reveal the superior performance of SLP in terms of symbol error rate (SER) and energy efficiency (EE), especially for the case where there is uncertainty in the non-circularity of the jammer.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Validation of Sub-mW 30GHz VG-LNAs in 22nm FDSOI CMOS for 5G/6G Phased-Array Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation (5G/6G) wireless systems demand low-power mm-wave phased-array ICs. Variable-gain LNAs (VGLNAs) are key building blocks enabling hardware complexity reduction, performance enhancement and functionality extension. This paper reports a performance benchmarking of two low-power 30GHz VG-LNAs for phased-array ICs, which provide a 7.5dB gain control for 18dB Taylor taper in a 30GHz 8x8 antenna array, for a comprehensive validation of the new class of VGLNAs and its design methodology. In particular, this paper reports a second and implementation (VG-LNA2) with a reduced number (four) of gain-control back-gate voltages and super-low-Vt MOSFETs, with respect to the previous first implementation (VG-LNA1) with six gain-control back-gate voltages and regular- Vt MOSFETs, both in the same 22nm FDSOI CMOS technology. The results show that VG-LNA2 exhibits performance comparable to those of VG-LNA1, with a slightly lower power consumption. Overall, the performance benchmarking shows that the design methodology adopted for the new class of VG-LNAs leads to record low-power consumption and small form factor solutions reaching the targeted performances, regardless of the arrangements of the back-gate voltages for gain control and transistor sets, resulting in a comprehensive validation of the innovative design features and effective design methodology.</description>

      <title>Addressing Pilot Contamination in Channel Estimation with Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pilot contamination (PC) is a well-known problem that affects massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. When frequency and pilots are reused between different cells, PC constitutes one of the main bottlenecks of the system's performance. In this paper, we propose a method based on the variational autoencoder (VAE), capable of reducing the impact of PC-related interference during channel estimation (CE). We obtain the first and second-order statistics of the conditionally Gaussian (CG) channels for both the user equipments (UEs) in a cell of interest and those in interfering cells, and we then use these moments to compute conditional linear minimum mean square error estimates. We show that the proposed estimator is capable of exploiting the interferers' additional statistical knowledge, outperforming other classical approaches. Moreover, we highlight how the achievable performance is tied to the chosen setup, making the setup selection crucial in the study of multi-cell CE.</description>

      <title>Variability in Grasp Type Distinction for Myoelectric Prosthesis Control Using a Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding multiple movements from the same limb using electroencephalographic (EEG) activity is a key challenge with applications for controlling prostheses in upper-limb amputees. This study investigates the classification of four hand movements to control a modified Myobock prosthesis via EEG signals. We report results from three EEG recording sessions involving four amputees and twenty able-bodied subjects performing four grasp movements under three conditions: Motor Execution (ME), Motor Imagery (MI), and Motor Observation (MO). EEG preprocessing was followed by feature extraction using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Wavelet Decomposition (WD), and Riemannian Geometry. Various classification algorithms were applied to decode EEG signals, and a metric assessed pattern separability. We evaluated system performance across different electrode combinations and compared it to the original setup. Our results show that distinguishing movement from no movement achieved 100% accuracy, while classification between movements reached 70-90%. No significant differences were found between recording conditions in classification performance. Able-bodied participants outperformed amputees, but there were no significant differences in Motor Imagery. Performance did not improve across the sessions, and there was considerable variability in EEG pattern distinction. Reducing the number of electrodes by half led to only a 2% average accuracy drop. These results provide insights into developing wearable brain-machine interfaces, particularly for electrode optimization and training in grasp movement classification.</description>

      <title>ART: Artifact Removal Transformer for Reconstructing Noise-Free Multichannel Electroencephalographic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artifact removal in electroencephalography (EEG) is a longstanding challenge that significantly impacts neuroscientific analysis and brain-computer interface (BCI) performance. Tackling this problem demands advanced algorithms, extensive noisy-clean training data, and thorough evaluation strategies. This study presents the Artifact Removal Transformer (ART), an innovative EEG denoising model employing transformer architecture to adeptly capture the transient millisecond-scale dynamics characteristic of EEG signals. Our approach offers a holistic, end-to-end denoising solution for diverse artifact types in multichannel EEG data. We enhanced the generation of noisy-clean EEG data pairs using an independent component analysis, thus fortifying the training scenarios critical for effective supervised learning. We performed comprehensive validations using a wide range of open datasets from various BCI applications, employing metrics like mean squared error and signal-to-noise ratio, as well as sophisticated techniques such as source localization and EEG component classification. Our evaluations confirm that ART surpasses other deep-learning-based artifact removal methods, setting a new benchmark in EEG signal processing. This advancement not only boosts the accuracy and reliability of artifact removal but also promises to catalyze further innovations in the field, facilitating the study of brain dynamics in naturalistic environments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Explainable AI in Revolutionizing Human Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex nature of disease mechanisms and the variability of patient symptoms present significant obstacles in developing effective diagnostic tools. Although machine learning has made considerable advances in medical diagnosis, its decision-making processes frequently lack transparency, which can jeopardize patient outcomes. This underscores the critical need for Explainable AI (XAI), which not only offers greater clarity but also has the potential to significantly improve patient care. In this literature review, we conduct a detailed analysis of analyzing XAI methods identified through searches across various databases, focusing on chronic conditions such as Parkinson's, stroke, depression, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The literature search revealed the application of 9 trending XAI algorithms in the field of healthcare and highlighted the pros and cons of each of them. Thus, the article is concluded with a critical appraisal of the challenges and future research opportunities for XAI in human health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multivariate Fronthaul Quantization for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional approach to the fronthaul design for cell-free massive MIMO system follows the compress-and-precode (CP) paradigm. Accordingly, encoded bits and precoding coefficients are shared by the distributed unit (DU) on the fronthaul links, and precoding takes place at the radio units (RUs). Previous theoretical work has shown that CP can be potentially improved by a significant margin by precode-and-compress (PC) methods, in which all baseband processing is carried out at the DU, which compresses the precoded signals for transmission on the fronthaul links. The theoretical performance gain of PC methods are particularly pronounced when the DU implements multivariate quantization (MQ), applying joint quantization across the signals for all the RUs. However, existing solutions for MQ are characterized by a computational complexity that grows exponentially with the sum-fronthaul capacity from the DU to all RUs. This work sets out to design scalable MQ strategies for PC-based cell-free massive MIMO systems. For the low-fronthaul capacity regime, we present alpha-parallel MQ (alpha-PMQ), whose complexity is exponential only in the fronthaul capacity towards an individual RU, while performing close to full MQ. alpha-PMQ tailors MQ to the topology of the network by allowing for parallel local quantization steps for RUs that do not interfere too much with each other. For the high-fronthaul capacity regime, we then introduce neural MQ, which replaces the exhaustive search in MQ with gradient-based updates for a neural-network-based decoder, attaining a complexity that grows linearly with the sum-fronthaul capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scalable MQ strategies outperform CP for both the low and high-fronthaul capacity regimes at the cost of increased computational complexity at the DU (but not at the RUs).</description>

      <title>Refracting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted URLLC for Millimeter Wave High-Speed Train Communication Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed train (HST) has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to the rapid development of railways worldwide. Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, known for its large bandwidth is an effective way to address performance bottlenecks in cellular network based HST wireless communication systems. However, mmWave signals suffer from significant path loss when traversing carriage, posing substantial challenges to cellular networks. To address this issue, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have gained considerable interest for its ability to enhance cell coverage by reflecting signals toward receiver. Ensuring communication reliability, a core performance indicators of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) in fifth-generation systems, is crucial for providing steady and reliable data transmissions along railways, particularly for delivering safety and control messages and monitoring HST signaling information. In this paper, we investigate a refracting RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output URLLC system in mmWave HST communications. We propose a sum rate maximization problem, subject to base station beamforming constraint, as well as refracting RIS discrete phase shifts and reliability constraints. To solve this optimization problem, we design a joint optimization algorithm based on alternating optimization method. This involves decoupling the original optimization problem into active beamforming design and packet error probability optimization subproblem, and discrete phase shift design subproblems. These subproblems are addressed exploiting Lagrangian dual method and the local search method, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and highlight the benefits of refracting RIS adoption for sum rate improvement in mmWave HST networks.</description>

      <title>Online Graph Filtering Over Expanding Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph filters are a staple tool for processing signals over graphs in a multitude of downstream tasks. However, they are commonly designed for graphs with a fixed number of nodes, despite real-world networks typically grow over time. This topological evolution is often known up to a stochastic model, thus, making conventional graph filters ill-equipped to withstand such topological changes, their uncertainty, as well as the dynamic nature of the incoming data. To tackle these issues, we propose an online graph filtering framework by relying on online learning principles. We design filters for scenarios where the topology is both known and unknown, including a learner adaptive to such evolution. We conduct a regret analysis to highlight the role played by the different components such as the online algorithm, the filter order, and the growing graph model. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real data corroborate the proposed approach for graph signal inference tasks and show a competitive performance w.r.t. baselines and state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>Joint Energy and SINR Coverage Probability in UAV Corridor-assisted RF-powered IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter studies the joint energy and signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR)-based coverage probability in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted radio frequency (RF)-powered Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The UAVs are spatially distributed in an aerial corridor that is modeled as a one-dimensional (1D) binomial point process (BPP). By accurately capturing the line-of-sight (LoS) probability of a UAV through large-scale fading i) an exact form expression for the energy coverage probability is derived, and ii) a tight approximation for the overall coverage performance is obtained. Among several key findings, numerical results reveal the optimal number of deployed UAV-BSs that maximizes the joint coverage probability, as well as the optimal length of the UAV corridors when designing such UAV-assisted IoT networks.</description>

      <title>PRIME: Phase Reversed Interleaved Multi-Echo acquisition enables highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a new pulse sequence for highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI (dMRI) by inserting an additional echo without prolonging TR, when generalized slice dithered enhanced resolution (gSlider) radiofrequency encoding is used for volumetric acquisition. Methods: A phase-reversed interleaved multi-echo acquisition (PRIME) was developed for rapid, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI, which includes two echoes where the first echo is for target diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisition with high-resolution and the second echo is acquired with either 1) lower-resolution for high-fidelity field map estimation, or 2) matching resolution to enable efficient diffusion relaxometry acquisitions. The sequence was evaluated on in vivo data acquired from healthy volunteers on clinical and Connectome 2.0 scanners. Results: In vivo experiments demonstrated that 1) high in-plane acceleration (Rin-plane of 5-fold with 2D partial Fourier) was achieved using the high-fidelity field maps estimated from the second echo, which was made at a lower resolution/acceleration to increase its SNR while matching the effective echo spacing of the first readout, 2) high-resolution diffusion relaxometry parameters were estimated from dual-echo PRIME data using a white matter model of multi-TE spherical mean technique (MTE-SMT), and 3) high-fidelity mesoscale DWI at 550 um isotropic resolution could be obtained in vivo by capitalizing on the high-performance gradients of the Connectome 2.0 scanner. Conclusion: The proposed PRIME sequence enabled highly accelerated, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI using an additional echo without prolonging scan time when gSlider encoding is utilized.</description>

      <title>Multi-Armed Bandit Dynamic Beam Zooming for mmWave Alignment and Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02896v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) algorithm that exploits the structure of a hierarchical codebook of beamforming vectors using a best-arm identification Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach for initial alignment and tracking of a Mobile Entity (ME). The algorithm, called Dynamic Beam Zooming (DBZ), performs beam adjustments that mitigate the severe outages associated with wireless mmWave systems and allow for adaptive control of the parameters governing communications. We analyze the sample complexity of DBZ and use it to inform how the algorithm adapts to the nonstationary MAB statistics based on ME motion and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). We perform extensive simulations to validate the approach and demonstrate that DBZ is competitive against existing Bayesian algorithms, without requiring channel multipath or fading knowledge. In particular, DBZ outperforms other low-complexity algorithms in the low SNR regime. We also illustrate the efficacy of DBZ in standardized rural and urban scenarios using NYU Sim.</description>

      <title>Track Coalescence and Repulsion in Multitarget Tracking: An Analysis of MHT, JPDA, and Belief Propagation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter methods and multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) methods are widely used for multitarget tracking (MTT). However, they are known to exhibit undesirable behavior in tracking scenarios with targets in close proximity: JPDA filter methods suffer from the track coalescence effect, i.e., the estimated tracks of targets in close proximity tend to merge and can become indistinguishable, and MHT methods suffer from an opposite effect known as track repulsion. In this paper, we review the JPDA filter and MHT methods and discuss the track coalescence and track repulsion effects. We also consider a more recent methodology for MTT that is based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithm, and we argue that BP-based MTT exhibits significantly reduced track coalescence and no track repulsion. Our theoretical arguments are confirmed by numerical results.</description>

      <title>Detecting 5G Narrowband Jammers with CNN, k-nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G cellular networks are particularly vulnerable against narrowband jammers that target specific control sub-channels in the radio signal. One mitigation approach is to detect such jamming attacks with an online observation system, based on machine learning. We propose to detect jamming at the physical layer with a pre-trained machine learning model that performs binary classification. Based on data from an experimental 5G network, we study the performance of different classification models. A convolutional neural network will be compared to support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, where the last two methods are combined with principal component analysis. The obtained results show substantial differences in terms of classification accuracy and computation time.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-enabled RIS-aided Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a movable antenna (MA)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance wireless communication and sensing performance in dead zones. Specifically, this paper aims to maximize the minimum beampattern gain at the RIS by jointly optimizing beamforming matrix at the base station (BS), the reflecting coefficients at the RIS and the positions of the MAs, subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the users and maximum transmit power at the BS. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and employ semidefinite relaxation (SDR), sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SRCR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Numerical results indicate that the MA and RIS-aided ISAC system outperforms conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) and RIS-aided systems. In addition, the application of MAs can reduce the similarity of user channels and enhance channel gain in the ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Distributed Noncoherent Joint Transmission Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dense Small Cell MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dense small cell (DSC) network where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) transmit data to single-antenna users over a shared frequency band. To enhance capacity, a state-of-the-art technique known as noncoherent joint transmission (JT) is applied, enabling users to receive data from multiple coordinated SBSs. However, the sum rate maximization problem with noncoherent JT is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard. While existing optimization-based noncoherent JT algorithms can provide near-optimal performance, they require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, which makes them difficult to be implemeted in DSC networks.To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem.The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions.By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate.In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-Object Tracking Under Limited Field of View Heterogeneous Sensors with Density Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of tracking multiple, unknown, and time-varying numbers of objects using a distributed network of heterogeneous sensors. In an effort to derive a formulation for practical settings, we consider limited and unknown sensor field-of-views (FoVs), sensors with limited local computational resources and communication channel capacity. The resulting distributed multi-object tracking algorithm involves solving an NP-hard multidimensional assignment problem either optimally for small-size problems or sub-optimally for general practical problems. For general problems, we propose an efficient distributed multi-object tracking algorithm that performs track-to-track fusion using a clustering-based analysis of the state space transformed into a density space to mitigate the complexity of the assignment problem. The proposed algorithm can more efficiently group local track estimates for fusion than existing approaches. To ensure we achieve globally consistent identities for tracks across a network of nodes as objects move between FoVs, we develop a graph-based algorithm to achieve label consensus and minimise track segmentation. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art solutions, achieving similar tracking accuracy and bandwidth requirements but with improved label consistency.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Electro-Optic Analog Memory for Neuromorphic Photonic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and biology. However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and ADCs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and compares various analog memory technologies for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup of the Dispersion and Codebook Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new formulations of max-sum and max-min dispersion problems that enable solutions via the Grover adaptive search (GAS) quantum algorithm, offering quadratic speedup. Dispersion problems are combinatorial optimization problems classified as NP-hard, which appear often in coding theory and wireless communications applications involving optimal codebook design. In turn, GAS is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm that can be used to implement full-fledged maximum-likelihood optimal solutions. In conventional naive formulations however, it is typical to rely on a binary vector spaces, resulting in search space sizes prohibitive even for GAS. To circumvent this challenge, we instead formulate the search of optimal dispersion problem over Dicke states, an equal superposition of binary vectors with equal Hamming weights, which significantly reduces the search space leading to a simplification of the quantum circuit via the elimination of penalty terms. Additionally, we propose a method to replace distance coefficients with their ranks, contributing to the reduction of the number of qubits. Our analysis demonstrates that as a result of the proposed techniques a reduction in query complexity compared to the conventional GAS using Hadamard transform is achieved, enhancing the feasibility of the quantum-based solution of the dispersion problem.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

      <title>TinyChirp: Bird Song Recognition Using TinyML Models on Low-power Wireless Acoustic Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring biodiversity at scale is challenging. Detecting and identifying species in fine grained taxonomies requires highly accurate machine learning (ML) methods. Training such models requires large high quality data sets. And deploying these models to low power devices requires novel compression techniques and model architectures. While species classification methods have profited from novel data sets and advances in ML methods, in particular neural networks, deploying these state of the art models to low power devices remains difficult. Here we present a comprehensive empirical comparison of various tinyML neural network architectures and compression techniques for species classification. We focus on the example of bird song detection, more concretely a data set curated for studying the corn bunting bird species. The data set is released along with all code and experiments of this study. In our experiments we compare predictive performance, memory and time complexity of classical spectrogram based methods and recent approaches operating on raw audio signal. Our results indicate that individual bird species can be robustly detected with relatively simple architectures that can be readily deployed to low power devices.</description>

      <title>Latent-EnSF: A Latent Ensemble Score Filter for High-Dimensional Data Assimilation with Sparse Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling and prediction of complex physical systems often rely on data assimilation techniques to correct errors inherent in model simulations. Traditional methods like the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its variants as well as the recently developed Ensemble Score Filters (EnSF) face significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear Bayesian filtering problems with sparse observations, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data assimilation method, Latent-EnSF, which leverages EnSF with efficient and consistent latent representations of the full states and sparse observations to address the joint challenges of high dimensionlity in states and high sparsity in observations for nonlinear Bayesian filtering. We introduce a coupled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with two encoders to encode the full states and sparse observations in a consistent way guaranteed by a latent distribution matching and regularization as well as a consistent state reconstruction. With comparison to several methods, we demonstrate the higher accuracy, faster convergence, and higher efficiency of Latent-EnSF for two challenging applications with complex models in shallow water wave propagation and medium-range weather forecasting, for highly sparse observations in both space and time.</description>
