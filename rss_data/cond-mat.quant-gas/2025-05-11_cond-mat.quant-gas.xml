      <title>Low-dimensional Bose-Bose Mixture in Random Speckle Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effect of the repulsive speckle potential in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates in one dimension (1D) and two dimension (2D). We simulated linear and circular random speckle potentials in 1D and 2D, respectively. Our calculation shows that the condensate density forms a sharp ring in 2D, and the condensate is divided into two parts in 1D at a high impurity density of speckle potential. We have calculated the energy and chemical potential of the system by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation to see the stability of the condensate. In our study, we have seen that the nature of the impurity response is the same for one-dimensional and two-dimensional quantum droplets.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of a Bipartite Quench in a 1D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long wavelength dynamics of 1D Bose gases with repulsive contact interactions can be captured by Generalized HydroDynamics (GHD) which predicts the evolution of the local rapidity distribution. The latter corresponds to the momentum distribution of quasiparticles, which have infinite lifetime owing to the integrability of the system. Here we experimentally investigate the dynamics for an initial situation that is the junction of two semi-infinite systems in different stationary states, a protocol referred to as "bipartite quench" protocol. More precisely we realise the particular case where one half of the system is the vacuum state. We show that the evolution of the boundary density profile exhibits ballistic dynamics obeying the Euler hydrodynamic scaling. The boundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD in the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects. We show that this protocol, provided the boundary profile is measured with infinite precision, permits to reconstruct the rapidity distribution of the initial state. For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by fitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond the thermal assumption. Finally, we investigate the local rapidity distribution inside the boundary profile, which, according to GHD, presents, on one side, features of zero-entropy states. The measured distribution shows the asymmetry predicted by GHD, although unelucidated deviations remain.</description>

      <title>Local Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Formalism for Dissipative Fermionic Systems and Loss-Induced Population Increase in Fermi Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a standard scheme to obtain the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) from the Lindblad master equation by neglecting its jump term, and propose an alternative approach to address the limitations of the former. It is shown that the NHH obtained by the conventional scheme fails to provide a good approximation for fermionic many-body systems, even on short timescales. To resolve this issue, we present a framework called the local NHH formalism, which describes the loss process in each individual mode locally. This formalism is applicable to general dissipative fermionic systems and remains consistent with the underlying Lindblad master equation at the level of the equations of motion of local observables. The local NHH formalism also provides a convenient framework for studying non-Hermitian physics in dissipative fermionic systems, especially for spectral analysis, compared to the Lindblad master equation. As an illustration, we consider a fermionic superfluid subjected to one-body loss and find the population increase induced by the loss, resulting from the locking of the relative phase between the pairing gap and the anomalous field. The conventional NHH fails to capture these unique phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Doppler effect in superfluid and supersolid atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing the formalism of hydrodynamics, we derive novel analytic predictions for the Doppler effect in superfluids with broken Galilean invariance and hosting persistent currents at zero temperature. We consider two scenarios: when Galilean invariance is broken explicitly (by external potentials) and spontaneously, as it happens in a supersolid. In the former case, the presence of a stationary current affects the propagation of sound via an anomalous Doppler term proportional to the density derivative of the superfluid fraction. In supersolids, where, according to Goldstone theorem, distinct sounds of hybrid superfluid and crystal nature can propagate, the Doppler effect can be very different for each sound. Quantitative estimates of the Doppler shifts are obtained for Bose-Einstein condensed atomic gases, described by Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The estimates are obtained both calculating the thermodynamic parameters entering the hydrodynamic results, and from full time-dependent simulations.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect and self-trapping in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider matter-wave bright solitons in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with a view to study Josephson-type oscillation and self-trapping of population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states. For fixed values of nonlinear interaction and lattice parameters, the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation and the frequency of oscillation decreases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential. The frequency of oscillation, however, increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.</description>

      <title>Tunneling Spectroscopy in Superconducting Circuit Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy of synthetic quantum matter in superconducting circuit lattices. We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different densities, observing changes in energy gaps across the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition and the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a new toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.</description>
