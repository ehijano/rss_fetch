      <title>Heterogeneous Mixed Traffic Control and Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban intersections, filled with a diverse mix of vehicles from small cars to large semi-trailers, present a persistent challenge for traffic control and management. This reality drives our investigation into how robot vehicles (RVs) can transform such heterogeneous traffic flow, particularly at unsignalized intersections where traditional control methods often falter during power failures and emergencies. Using reinforcement learning (RL) and real-world traffic data, we study heterogeneous mixed traffic across complex intersections under gradual automation by varying RV penetration from 10% to 90%. The results are compelling: average waiting times decrease by up to 86% and 91% compared to signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively. Additionally, we uncover a "rarity advantage," where less frequent vehicles, such as trucks, benefit the most from RV coordination (by up to 87%). RVs' presence also leads to lower CO2 emissions and fuel consumption compared to managing traffic via traffic lights. Moreover, space headways decrease across all vehicle types as RV rate increases, indicating better road space utilization.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Cooperative Output Regulation of Continuous-Time Multi-Agent Systems with Unknown Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates data-driven cooperative output regulation for continuous-time multi-agent systems with unknown network topology. Unlike existing studies that typically assume a known network topology to directly compute controller parameters, a novel approach is proposed that allows for the computation of the parameter without prior knowledge of the topology. A lower bound on the minimum non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is estimated using only edge weight bounds, enabling the output regulation controller design to be independent of global network information. Additionally, the common need for state derivative measurements is eliminated, reducing the amount of data requirements. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the data are informative for cooperative output regulation, leading to the design of a distributed output regulation controller. For the case with noisy data, the bound of the output error is provided, which is positively correlated with the noise bound, and a distributed controller is constructed for the approximate cooperative output regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Social impact of CAVs -- coexistence of machines and humans in the context of route choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose in a stable urban traffic system populated only by human driven vehicles (HDVs), a given proportion (e.g. 10%) is replaced by a fleet of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which share information and pursue a collective goal. Suppose these vehicles are centrally coordinated and differ from HDVs only by their collective capacities allowing them to make more efficient routing decisions before the travel on a given day begins. Suppose there is a choice between two routes and every day each driver makes a decision which route to take. Human drivers maximize their utility. CAVs might optimize different goals, such as the total travel time of the fleet. We show that in this plausible futuristic setting, the strategy CAVs are allowed to adopt may result in human drivers either benefitting or being systematically disadvantaged and urban networks becoming more or less optimal. Consequently, some regulatory measures might become indispensable.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Market Model Can Explain the Impact of AI Traders in Financial Markets -- A New Microfoundations of GARCH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AI traders in financial markets have sparked significant interest in their effects on price formation mechanisms and market volatility, raising important questions for market stability and regulation. Despite this interest, a comprehensive model to quantitatively assess the specific impacts of AI traders remains undeveloped. This study aims to address this gap by modeling the influence of AI traders on market price formation and volatility within a multi-agent framework, leveraging the concept of microfoundations. Microfoundations involve understanding macroeconomic phenomena, such as market price formation, through the decision-making and interactions of individual economic agents. While widely acknowledged in macroeconomics, microfoundational approaches remain unexplored in empirical finance, particularly for models like the GARCH model, which captures key financial statistical properties such as volatility clustering and fat tails. This study proposes a multi-agent market model to derive the microfoundations of the GARCH model, incorporating three types of agents: noise traders, fundamental traders, and AI traders. By mathematically aggregating the micro-structure of these agents, we establish the microfoundations of the GARCH model. We validate this model through multi-agent simulations, confirming its ability to reproduce the stylized facts of financial markets. Finally, we analyze the impact of AI traders using parameters derived from these microfoundations, contributing to a deeper understanding of their role in market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Frisking-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes fixed competition that is manifested through a constant weight that each agent gives to its initial opinion in addition to its contribution through a consensus dynamic. This letter investigates the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We show that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We evaluate this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. If competition is not uniform across clients, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate and validate our analytical insights numerically.</description>

      <title>Iteration of Thought: Leveraging Inner Dialogue for Autonomous Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative human engagement is a common and effective means of leveraging the advanced language processing power of large language models (LLMs). Using well-structured prompts in a conversational manner, human users can effectively influence an LLM to develop more thoughtful and accurate responses. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework for enhancing LLM responses by generating "thought"-provoking prompts vis a vis an input query and the current iteration of an LLM's response. Unlike static or semi-static approaches, e.g. Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), IoT adapts its reasoning path dynamically, based on evolving context, and without generating alternate explorative thoughts which are ultimately discarded. The three components of the IoT framework are (1) an Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA) responsible for generating instructive, context-specific prompts; (2) an LLM Agent (LLMA) that processes these prompts to refine its responses; and (3) an iterative prompting loop that implements a conversation between the former two components. We introduce two variants of our framework: Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT), where an LLM decides when to stop iterating, and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), which always forces a fixed number iterations. We investigate the performance of IoT across various datasets, spanning complex reasoning tasks from the GPQA dataset, explorative problem-solving in Game of 24, puzzle solving in Mini Crosswords, and multi-hop question answering from the HotpotQA dataset. Our results show that IoT represents a viable paradigm for autonomous response refinement in LLMs, showcasing significant improvements over CoT and thereby enabling more adaptive and efficient reasoning systems that minimize human intervention.</description>

      <title>A Model for Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Interaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01430v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model for multi-agent interaction problems to understand how a heterogeneous team of agents should organize its resources to tackle a heterogeneous team of attackers. This model is inspired by how the human immune system tackles a diverse set of pathogens. The key property of this model is a ``cross-reactivity'' kernel which enables a particular defender type to respond strongly to some attacker types but weakly to a few different types of attackers. We show how due to such cross-reactivity, the defender team can optimally counteract a heterogeneous attacker team using very few types of defender agents, and thereby minimize its resources. We study this model in different settings to characterize a set of guiding principles for control problems with heterogeneous teams of agents, e.g., sensitivity of the harm to sub-optimal defender distributions, and competition between defenders gives near-optimal behavior using decentralized computation of the control. We also compare this model with existing approaches including reinforcement-learned policies, perimeter defense, and coverage control.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions on Bipartite Consensus of Weakly Connected Matrix-weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in bipartite consensus, a scenario where agents are divided into two disjoint sets with agents in the same set agreeing on a certain value and those in different sets agreeing on opposite or specifically related values, have highlighted its potential applications across various fields. Traditional research typically relies on the presence of a positive-negative spanning tree, which limits the practical applicability of bipartite consensus. This study relaxes that assumption by allowing for weak connectivity within the network, where paths can be weighted by semidefinite matrices. By exploring the algebraic constraints imposed by positive-negative trees and semidefinite paths, we derive sufficient conditions for achieving bipartite consensus. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Cognitive Interaction Model of Instrument Operations at the Linac Coherent Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel multi-agent, multi-scale computational cognitive interaction model of instrument operations at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). A leading scientific user facility, LCLS is the world's first hard x-ray free electron laser, operated by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. As the world's first x-ray free electron laser, LCLS is in high demand and heavily oversubscribed. Our overall project employs cognitive engineering methodologies to improve experimental efficiency and scientific productivity by refining experimental interfaces and workflows, simplifying tasks, reducing errors, and improving operator safety and stress levels. Our model simulates aspects of human cognition at multiple cognitive and temporal scales, ranging from seconds to hours, and among agents playing multiple roles, including instrument operator, real time data analyst, and experiment manager. The model can predict impacts stemming from proposed changes to operational interfaces and workflows. Because the model code is open source, and supplemental videos go into detail on all aspects of the model and results, this approach could be applied to other experimental apparatus and processes. Example results demonstrate the model's potential in guiding modifications to improve operational efficiency and scientific output. We discuss the implications of our findings for cognitive engineering in complex experimental settings and outline future directions for research.</description>

      <title>Consensus Planning with Primal, Dual, and Proximal Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus planning is a method for coordinating decision making across complex systems and organizations, including complex supply chain optimization pipelines. It arises when large interdependent distributed agents (systems) share common resources and must act in order to achieve a joint goal. In prior consensus planning work, all agents have been assumed to have the same interaction pattern (e.g., all dual agents or all primal agents or all proximal agents), most commonly using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as proximal agents. However, this is often not a valid assumption in practice, where agents consist of large complex systems, and where we might not have the luxury of modifying these large complex systems at will. In this paper, we introduce a consensus algorithm that overcomes this hurdle by allowing for the coordination of agents with different types of interfaces (named primal, dual, and proximal). Our consensus planning algorithm allows for any mix of agents by combining ADMM-like updates for the proximal agents, dual ascent updates for the dual agents, and linearized ADMM updates for the primal agents. We prove convergence results for the algorithm, namely a sublinear O(1/k) convergence rate under mild assumptions, and two-step linear convergence under stronger assumptions. We also discuss enhancements to the basic method and provide illustrative empirical results.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed or evolved towards the current strains of a virus. In learning terms, this corresponds to a myopic best response, i.e., not considering the possible adaptive moves of the opponent. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. To motivate our work, we consider antibody designs that target not only the current viral strains but also the wide range of possible future variants that the virus might evolve into under the evolutionary pressure exerted by said antibodies. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of the viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simple model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.</description>
