      <title>Analysis of clustering fragments of $^7$Li and $^7$Be in the microscopic cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear structures of $^7$Li($\alpha+n+n+p$) and $^7$Be($\alpha+p+p+n$) are studied within the microscopic cluster model, in which the clustering fragments e.g., triton, $^3$He, and even the single nucleons around the core are studied in the $^7$Li and $^7$Be systems. We obtain the energy spectra and wave functions of $^7$Li and $^7$Be, and the calculated energy spectra of the ground states and some of the excited states are consistent with experimental data. To investigate the cluster-formation probabilities, we calculate the reduced-width amplitudes of various binary partitions. The results show that the $\alpha+t(^3\mathrm{He})$ cluster structure is dominant in the low-lying states of $^7$Li($^7$Be), including the ground state and the three lowest excited states. In some higher states around the single-particle thresholds, the components of $\mathrm{core}+N$ structures, namely $^6\mathrm{Li}+n$ and $^6\mathrm{He}+p$ in $^7$Li and $^6\mathrm{Li}+p$ in $^7$Be, are significantly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Shell effects and multi-chance fission in the sub-lead region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the recently developed five-dimensional Langevin approach for the description of fission of heavy nuclei, we have calculated the fission fragments mass and kinetic energy distributions for the fission of $^{180}$Hg and $^{190}$Hg formed in the reactions $^{36}$Ar +$^{144}$Sm $\Rightarrow$ $^{180}$Hg and $^{36}$Ar +$^{154}$Sm $\Rightarrow$ $^{190}$Hg at few excitation energies and found very good agreement between the calculated and experimental results. Special attention was paid to the accurate description of the dependence of shell effects on the excitation energy. It was shown that the effect of multi-chance fission on the mass distribution is noticeable only at small excitation energies. The kinetic energy distributions are more sensitive to pre-scission neutron emission.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit correlation and spatial distributions for spin-0 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>

      <title>On the Calculation of Pressure Derivatives in Mean-Field Thermal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of higher-order pressure derivatives with respect to temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$ is essential for analyzing critical phenomena, transport properties, and phase transitions in strongly interacting matter. However, standard numerical differentiation methods often suffer from large numerical instabilities, especially in more complex mean-field thermal field theories. In this work, we present an approach that systematically derives symbolic expressions for these higher-order derivatives, bypassing the numerical instabilities commonly encountered in conventional methods. Our formalism is based on a Jacobian technique, which ensures that the dependence of internal mean-field parameters is fully incorporated into the final symbolic expressions. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as an example and show that it is particularly advantageous near phase transitions and at low temperatures, where numerical differentiation becomes highly sensitive.</description>

      <title>Probing Nuclear Excitation by Electron Capture in an Electron Beam Ion Trap with Non-destructive Isomer Detection via Precision Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) is an important nuclear excitation mechanism which still lacks conclusive experimental verification. This is primarily attributed to strong background x-/$\gamma$-ray noise and competing nuclear excitation processes which would overshadow the signals in various environments that NEEC takes place. Here, we propose an experimental approach to observe the NEEC process within a background-free environment. Through collisions with a highly-compressed mono-energetic electron beam in an electron beam ion trap, nuclei may get excited to a long-lived isomeric state via the NEEC process. Subsequently, ions can be extracted and Penning-trap mass spectrometry employed to unambiguously detect the isomer. Our study focuses on the promising candidate $^{189}\mathrm{Os}$, demonstrating measurable detection rates of the NEEC process and discussing the feasibility of the proposed approach. This new approach for observing the NEEC process may be realized in the near future.</description>

      <title>Sub-barrier d+$^{208}$Pb scattering and sensitivity to nucleon-nucleon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the non-perturbative time-dependent basis function (tBF) approach to solve for the sub-Coulomb barrier scattering of the deuteron projectile on the $^{208}$Pb target. Specifically, we treat the target as a source of a strong external Coulomb field that induces higher-order effects in electric-dipole excitations of the deuteron projectile including the population of states not accessible through direct electric-dipole transitions from the ground state of the deuteron. We calculate the electric-dipole polarizability of the deuteron and elastic scattering observables for comparison with experimental data. With no adjustable parameters, the tBF approach provides good agreement with experimentally available differential cross-section ratios. The dependence of these measured quantities on nucleon-nucleon interactions is investigated. We also investigate the detailed scattering dynamics and identify characteristics of coherent and incoherent processes.</description>

      <title>Fast rotation of nuclei with extreme isospin in the vicinity of neutron and proton drip lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of the present understanding of collective rotation in very neutron-rich nuclei is presented. It is shown that collective rotation can lead to the increase of stability of rotational states with increasing spin. The detailed investigation of rotational excitations in very proton-rich nuclei confirms this conclusion and indicate that experimental studies of such features are more feasible in the nuclei near proton drip line. They also show that rotational bands which are proton quasi-bound at zero or low spins can be transformed into proton bound ones at high spin by collective rotation of nuclear systems. This is due to strong Coriolis interaction which acts on high-$j$ or strongly mixed M orbitals and drives the highest in energy occupied single-particle states into negative energy domain. These physical mechanisms lead to a substantial extension of the nuclear landscape beyond the spin zero proton drip line. In addition, a new phenomenon of the formation of giant proton halos in rotating nuclei emerges: it is triggered by the occupation of strongly mixed M intruder orbitals.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear structure and the equation of state through pre-equilibrium dipole emission in charge-asymmetric reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pre-equilibrium dipole response in the charge-asymmetric reaction $^{40}$Ca+$^{152}$Sm, of recent experimental interest, at several beam energies within the range $[5, 11]$ AMeV and different collision centralities. By employing Skyrme-like effective interactions for the nuclear mean field, we probe the role of the different ingredients performing theoretical calculations based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach or a semi-classical transport model that also includes two-body correlations. A comparative analysis between these approaches allowed us to disentangle the role of deformation effects in the entrance channel from the ones associated with structure details of genuine quantal nature on the dipole emission. Moreover, we also investigate the impact of the occurrence of residual two-body collisions on the reaction dynamics. This study contributes to the understanding of the microscopic processes that determine the complex dynamics of low-energy heavy-ion collisions along the fusion-fission path, which is relevant to super-heavy element synthesis, unraveling interesting connections with the characteristics of the nuclear effective interaction and the associated equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice effective field theory applies the principles of effective field theory in a lattice framework where space and time are discretized. Nucleons are placed on the lattice sites, and the interactions are tuned to replicate the observed features of the nuclear force. Monte Carlo simulations are then employed to predict the properties of nuclear few- and many-body systems. We review the basic methods and several theoretical and algorithmic advances that have been used to further our understanding of atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Vector Space Integration for Dark Matter Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a highly efficient integration method for scattering calculations, and a ``partial rate matrix'' that encodes the scattering rate as a function of the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. This replaces the original multidimensional rate integral with a simple exercise in vector multiplication, speeding up the rate calculation by a factor of around $10^8$. I include a scheme to fully factorize the dark matter particle model, its astrophysical velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material from each other, enabling efficient calculation of the partial rate matrix even in studies comparing large sets of these input functions. This is now the only sensible way to evaluate the dark matter scattering rate in anisotropic detector materials. It is straightforward to generalize this method to other difficult but linear problems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Harmonic Integration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new integration method drastically improves the efficiency of the dark matter direct detection calculation. In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.
  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of $^{84}$Br, $^{105}$Mo, $^{115,119,121}$Pd, $^{122}$Ag, $^{127,129}$In, $^{132}$Sb and their respective isomeric states have been measured with the JYFLTRAP Penning trap mass spectrometer using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique. The excitation energies of the isomeric states in $^{132}$Sb and $^{119}$Pd were experimentally determined for the first time, while for $^{84}$Br, $^{115}$Pd and $^{127,129}$In, the precision of the mass values was substantially improved. In $^{105}$Mo and $^{121}$Pd there were no signs of a long-lived isomeric state. The ground-state measurements of $^{119}$Pd and $^{122}$Ag indicated that both are significantly more bound than the literature values. For $^{122}$Ag, there was no indication of a proposed third long-lived state. The results for the $N=49$ nucleus $^{84}$Br and isomers close to doubly magic $^{132}$Sn have been compared to the shell-model and the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model calculations.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with the latent heat of neutron star matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Seidov limit is a bound on the maximum latent heat that a presumed first-order phase transition of neutron-star matter can have before its excess energy density, not compensated by additional pressure, results in gravitational collapse. Because latent heat forces an apparent nonanalytic behaviour in plots correlating physical quantities (kinks in two-dimensional, ridges in three-dimensional ones), it can be constrained by data. As the onset of collapse depends on the intensity of gravity, testing for sudden derivative changes and, if they are large, breaching the Seidov limit would reward with two successive discoveries: such a phase transition (which could stem from hadron matter but also from a gravitational phase transition), and a modification of General Relativity (thus breaking the matter/gravity degeneracy). We illustrate the point with $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ metric gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

Abstract: The gauge covariance of the quark gap equation is compared for three quark-gluon vertices: the bare vertex, a Ball-Chiu like vertex constrained by the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identity, and a full vertex including the transverse components derived from transverse Slavnov-Taylor identities. The covariance properties are verified with the chiral quark condensate and the pion decay constant in the chiral limit.</description>

Abstract: Assuming isospin conservation, the decay of a $c\bar c$ vector meson into the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state is purely electromagnetic. At the leading order, the $c\bar c$ vector meson first converts into a virtual photon that, then produces the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state. Moreover, such a mechanism, i.e., the virtual photon coupling to $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$, is the solely intermediate process through which, in Born approximation, the reaction $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ does proceed. It follows that any significant difference between the amplitudes of the processes $c\bar c\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ at the $c\bar c$ mass must be ascribed to an isospin-violating contribution in the $c\bar c$ decay. In Eur. Phys. J. C $\boldsymbol{80}$, 903 (2020) we studied the decay of the $\psi(2S)$ vector meson into $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and, on the light of the large branching fraction ${\rm BR}_{18}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.23\pm0.24)\times 10^{-5}$, published in the 2018 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{98}$, 030001 (2018), we claimed either the presence of a significant isospin-violating contribution or, with a lesser emphasis, a "not complete reliability of the only available datum". In any case, we propose a new measurement. Apparently, our second and considered less serious hypothesis was the right one, indeed the branching fraction published in the 2024 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{110}$, 030001 (2024) is $ {\rm BR}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$, more than seven times lower with the error that increased from $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 45\%$.</description>
