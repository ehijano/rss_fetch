      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part II -- Network-level mechanisms and emergent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the phenomenological and microscopic models reviewed in Part I, this second part focuses on network-level mechanisms that generate emergent temperature response curves. We review deterministic models in which temperature modulates the kinetics of coupled biochemical reactions, as well as stochastic frameworks, such as Markov chains, that capture more complex multi-step processes. These approaches show how Arrhenius-like temperature dependence at the level of individual reactions is transformed into non-Arrhenius scaling, thermal limits, and temperature compensation at the system level. Together, network-level models provide a mechanistic bridge between empirical temperature response curves and the molecular organization of biological systems, giving us predictive insights into robustness, perturbations, and evolutionary constraints.</description>

      <title>Restoring information in aged gene regulatory networks by single knock-ins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hallmark of aging is loss of information in gene regulatory networks. These networks are tightly connected, raising the question of whether information could be restored by perturbing single genes. We develop a simple theoretical framework for information transmission in gene regulatory networks that describes the information gained or lost when a gene is "knocked in" (exogenously expressed). Applying the framework to gene expression data from muscle cells in young and old mice, we find that single knock-ins can restore network information by up to 10%. Our work advances the study of information flow in networks and identifies potential gene targets for rejuvenation.</description>

      <title>Investigating Knowledge Distillation Through Neural Networks for Protein Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.</description>

      <title>Functional classification of metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks underpin biological and physical phenomena across scales, from microbial interactions to planetary atmosphere dynamics. Bacterial communities exhibit complex competitive interactions for resources, human organs and tissues demonstrate specialized biochemical functions, and planetary atmospheres can display diverse organic and inorganic chemical processes. Despite their complexities, comparing these networks methodically remains a challenge due to the vast underlying degrees of freedom. In biological systems, comparative genomics has been pivotal in tracing evolutionary trajectories and classifying organisms via DNA sequences. However, purely genomic classifications often fail to capture functional roles within ecological systems. Metabolic changes driven by nutrient availability highlight the need for classification schemes that integrate metabolic information. Here we introduce and apply a computational framework for a classification scheme of organisms that compares matrix representations of chemical reaction networks using the Grassmann distance, corresponding to measuring distances between the nullspaces of stoichiometric matrices. Applying this framework to human gut microbiome data confirms that metabolic distances are distinct from phylogenetic distances, underscoring the limitations of genetic information in metabolic classification. Importantly, our analysis of metabolic distances reveals functional groups of organisms enriched or depleted in specific metabolic processes and shows robustness to metabolically silent genetic perturbations. The generalizability of metabolic Grassmann distances is illustrated by application to chemical reaction networks in human tissue and planetary atmospheres, highlighting its potential for advancing functional comparisons across diverse chemical reaction systems.</description>

      <title>Allostery Beyond Amplification: Temporal Regulation of Signaling Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.</description>
