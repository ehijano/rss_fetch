      <title>AI Persuasion, Bayesian Attribution, and Career Concerns of Doctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how AI persuades doctors when their diagnoses differ. Disagreements arise from two sources: attention differences, which are objective and play a complementary role to the doctor, and comprehension differences, which are subjective and act as substitutes. AI's interpretability influences how doctors attribute these sources and their willingness to change their minds. Surprisingly, uninterpretable AI can be more persuasive by allowing doctors to partially attribute disagreements to attention differences. This effect is stronger when doctors have low abnormality detection skills. Additionally, uninterpretable AI can improve diagnostic accuracy when doctors have career concerns.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Viral Nature of Toxicity in Competitive Online Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toxicity is a widespread phenomenon in competitive online video games. In addition to its direct undesirable effects, there is a concern that toxicity can spread to others, amplifying the harm caused by a single player's misbehavior. In this study, we estimate whether and to what extent a player's toxic speech spreads, causing their teammates to behave similarly. To this end, we analyze proprietary data from the free-to-play first-person action game Call of Duty: Warzone. We formulate and implement an instrumental variable identification strategy that leverages the network of interactions among players across matches. Our analysis reveals that all else equal, all of a player's teammates engaging in toxic speech increases their probability of engaging in similar behavior by 26.1 to 30.3 times the average player's likelihood of engaging in toxic speech. These findings confirm the viral nature of toxicity, especially toxic speech, in competitive online video games.</description>

      <title>Auction designs to increase incentive compatibility and reduce self-scheduling in electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The system operator's scheduling problem in electricity markets, called unit commitment, is a non-convex mixed-integer program. The optimal value function is non-convex, preventing the application of traditional marginal pricing theory to find prices that clear the market and incentivize market participants to follow the dispatch schedule. Units that perceive the opportunity to make a profit may be incentivized to self-commit (submitting an offer with zero fixed operating costs) or self-schedule their production (submitting an offer with zero total cost). We simulate bidder behavior to show that market power can be exercised by self-committing/scheduling. Agents can learn to increase their profits via a reinforcement learning algorithm without explicit knowledge of the costs or strategies of other agents. We investigate different non-convex pricing models over a multi-period commitment window simulating the day-ahead market and show that convex hull pricing can reduce producer incentives to deviate from the central dispatch decision. In a realistic test system with approximately 1000 generators, we find strategic bidding under the restricted convex model can increase total producer profits by 4.4\% and decrease lost opportunity costs by 2/3. While the cost to consumers with convex hull pricing is higher at the competitive solution, the cost to consumers is higher with the restricted convex model after strategic bidding.</description>

      <title>Impacts of electric carsharing on a power sector with variable renewables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrifying the car fleet is a major strategy for mitigating emissions in the transport sector. As electrification cannot solve all negative externalities associated with cars, reducing the size of the car fleet would be beneficial. Electric carsharing could allow to reconcile current car usage habits with a smaller fleet, but this may reduce the potential of electric cars to align their grid interactions with variable renewable electricity generation. We investigate how electric carsharing may impact the power sector, combining three methods: sequence clustering of car travel diaries, generation of synthetic electric vehicle time series, and power sector modelling. We show that switching to electric carsharing only moderately increases power sector costs, less than 110 euros per substituted car in our main setting. This effect is largest with bidirectional charging. We conclude that the power sector interactions of shared electric car fleets could still be aligned with variable renewable electricity generation.</description>

      <title>The Impossible Trinity of Human Space Usage between Home, Workplace and Amenity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an impossible trinity of human space usage between home, workplace, and amenity in this paper to explain mobility pattern changes and shifts in demand for space during COVID-19. We developed detailed time usage and location visit profiles for 60,131 people in England and Wales by analyzing about 120 million cell phone location and timestamp records on March 2020 and March 2021. We found that both at-home time and amenity visits increased during COVID-19, while workplace visits decreased. Individual visits to different locations are determined by three key factors: individual preference measured by pre-pandemic location visit frequency, time constraints influenced by work-from-home, and space accessibility. We also find that WFH improves equality of individual amenity usage between people of different incomes. Low-income and middle-income people saw an 8% and 4% increase in additional amenity visits, respectively, compared to high-income people during the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic disparities in mobility behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile phone data have played a key role in quantifying human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing studies on mobility patterns have primarily focused on regional aggregates in high-income countries, obfuscating the accentuated impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging geolocation data from mobile-phone users and population census for 6 middle-income countries across 3 continents between March and December 2020, we uncovered common disparities in the behavioral response to the pandemic across socioeconomic groups. Users living in low-wealth neighborhoods were less likely to respond by self-isolating, relocating to rural areas, or refraining from commuting to work. The gap in the behavioral responses between socioeconomic groups persisted during the entire observation period. Among users living in low-wealth neighborhoods, those who commute to work in high-wealth neighborhoods pre-pandemic were particularly at risk of experiencing economic stress, facing both the reduction in economic activity in the high-wealth neighborhood and being more likely to be affected by public transport closures due to their longer commute distances. While confinement policies were predominantly country-wide, these results suggest that, when data to identify vulnerable individuals are not readily available, GPS-based analytics could help design targeted place-based policies to aid the most vulnerable.</description>
