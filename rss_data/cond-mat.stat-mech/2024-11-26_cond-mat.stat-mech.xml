      <title>Regularizing 3D conformal field theories via anyons on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently introduced ''fuzzy sphere'' method has enabled accurate numerical regularizations of certain three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs). The regularization is provided by the non-commutative geometry of the lowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially gapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor $\nu=1$, while the electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy sphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important question: how finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be? Here, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron fillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the charge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state -- a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied $\nu=1$ case. Remarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the FQH spectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically-accessible system sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the exchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in the charge sector. Our results set the stage for the fuzzy-sphere exploration of conformal critical points between topologically-ordered states.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto model with stochastic resetting and coupling through an external medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies of collective phenomena in oscillator networks focus on directly coupled systems as exemplified by the classical Kuramoto model. However, there are growing number of examples in which oscillators interact indirectly via a common external medium, including bacterial quorum sensing (QS) networks, pedestrians walking on a bridge, and centrally coupled lasers. In this paper we analyze the effects of stochastic phase resetting on a Kuramoto model with indirect coupling. All the phases are simultaneously reset to their initial values at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process. On the other hand, the external environmental state is not reset. We first derive a continuity equation for the population density in the presence of resetting and show how the resulting density equation is itself subject to stochastic resetting. We then use an Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz to reduce the infinite-dimensional system to a four-dimensional piecewise deterministic system with subsystem resetting. The latter is used to explore how synchronization depends on a cell density parameter. (In bacterial QS this represents the ratio of the population cell volume and the extracellular volume.) At high densities we recover the OA dynamics of the classical Kuramoto model with global resetting. On the other hand, at low densities, we show how subsystem resetting has a major effect on collective synchronization, ranging from noise-induced transitions to slow/fast dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic calculus of run-and-tumble motion: an applied perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The run-and-tumble particle (RTP) is one of the simplest examples of an active particle in which the direction of constant motion randomly switches. In the one-dimensional (1D) case this means switching between rightward and leftward velocities. Most theoretical studies of RTPs are based on the analysis of the Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) differential equation describing the evolution of the joint probability densities for particle position and velocity state. In this paper we develop an alternative, probabilistic framework of 1D RTP motion based on the stochastic calculus of Poisson and diffusion processes. In particular, we show how a generalisation of It\^o's lemma provides a direct link between sample paths of an RTP and the underlying CK equation. This allows us to incorporate various non-trivial extensions in a systematic fashion, including stochastic resetting and partially absorbing sticky boundaries. The velocity switching process and resetting process are represented by a pair of independent Poisson processes, whereas a sticky boundary is modelled using a boundary layer. We then use the probabilistic formulation to calculate stochastic entropy production along individual trajectories of an RTP, and show how the corresponding Gibbs-Shannon entropy is recovered by averaging over the ensemble of sample paths. Finally, we extend the probabilistic framework to a population of RTPs and use this to explore the effects of global resetting.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusion anomalies of an odd tracer in soft-core media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd-diffusive systems, characterised by broken time-reversal and/or parity symmetry, have recently been shown to display counterintuitive features such as interaction-enhanced dynamics in the dilute limit. Here we we extend the investigation to the high-density limit of an odd tracer embedded in a soft-Gaussian core medium (GCM) using a field-theoretic approach based on the Dean-Kawasaki equation. Our theory reveals that interactions can enhance the dynamics of an odd tracer even in dense systems. We demonstrate that oddness results in a complete reversal of the well-known self-diffusion ($D_\mathrm{s}$) anomaly of the GCM. Ordinarily, $D_\mathrm{s}$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend with increasing density, approaching but remaining below the interaction-free diffusion, $D_0$, ($D_\mathrm{s} &lt; D_0$) so that $D_\mathrm{s} \uparrow D_0$ at high densities. In contrast, for an odd tracer, self-diffusion is enhanced ($D_\mathrm{s}&gt; D_0$) and the GCM anomaly is inverted, displaying $D_\mathrm{s} \downarrow D_0$ at high densities. The transition between the standard and reversed GCM anomaly is governed by the tracer's oddness, with a critical oddness value at which the tracer diffuses as a free particle ($D_\mathrm{s} \approx D_0$) across all densities. We validate our theoretical predictions with Brownian dynamics simulations, finding strong agreement between the two.</description>

      <title>Violation of Cluster Property in Superconducting Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is well known to be a macroscopic phenomenon in quantum physics in many body systems. The essential features of this phenomenon are the energy degeneracy and the existence of the local operator that can modify the degenerate states. Due to these properties the lowest energy state is not stable. In order to obtain the stable ground state we introduce the explicitly breaking interaction, by which it is difficult for the local operator to modify the ground state. In the superconducting qubit there exists the stable eigenstate with the definite charge number. We point out that in this system, the local operator can change this state to another state. As results the cluster property violates, which means that the events in the far distance are not irrelevant. In this paper we examine the cluster property in the superconducting qubit. Then we propose a method by cavity quantum electrodynamics with two cavities in order to observe the violation.</description>

      <title>Mismatch cost of computing: from circuits to algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics extends equilibrium statistical physics to systems arbitrarily far from thermal equilibrium, with arbitrarily many quickly evolving degrees of freedom. These features make it the correct framework for analyzing the thermodynamics of real-world computers. Specifically, stochastic thermodynamics has been used to prove that the "mismatch cost" of a dynamic process is a lower bound on the energy dissipation, namely the entropy production (EP), of any physical system that implements that process. In particular, the mismatch cost for any periodic process - like every modern digital device - is strictly positive. Here we show that mismatch cost may be significant on the macroscopic scale, not just on the nanoscale (in contrast to many other stochastic thermodynamics bounds). We also show that the mismatch cost of systems that are coarse-grained in time and/or space still provides lower bounds to the microscopic entropy production of running such systems. We then argue that traditional computer science measures of algorithmic efficiency, focused on the resource costs of "space" and "time" complexity, should include a third cost - thermodynamic cost - and that mismatch cost is well-suited to bounding such a cost for arbitrary computational machines. Accordingly, we derive the mismatch cost for running an arbitrary Boolean circuit and for running an arbitrary Random Access Stored Program machine (a simplified model of a microprocessor).</description>

      <title>Anomalous velocity distributions in slow quantum-tunneling chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work [Wild et al., Nature 615, 425 (2023)] has provided an experimental break-through in the realization of a quantum-tunneling reaction involving a proton transfer. The reaction $D^-+H_2 \to H^-+HD$ has an extremely slow reaction rate as it can happen only via quantum tunneling, thus requiring an extremely large density of the reactants in the ion trap. At these high densities strong deviations from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics are observed. Here we develop a consistent generalized statistical mechanics theory for the above nonequilibrium situation involving quantum effects at high densities. The trapped ions are treated in a superstatistical way and a $q$-Maxwellian velocity distribution with a universal dependence of the entropic index $q$ on the density $n$ of the buffer gas is derived. We show that the velocity distribution of the ions is non-Maxwellian, more precisely $q$-Gaussian, i.e., $p(v) \propto v^2 [1+(q-1)\tilde{\beta} v^2]^{1/(1-q)}$, with entropic index $q&gt;1$ depending on the density $n$ of $H_2$ molecules, in excellent agreement with the experimental observations of Wild et al. Our theory also makes predictions on the statistics of temperature fluctuations in the ion trap which can be tested in future experiments. Through the superstatistical approach, we obtain an analytical expression for $q(n)$ which is consistent with the available experimental data, and which yields $\lim_{n\to 0}q(n)=1$, i.e. recovering the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the ideal gas limit, as well as $\lim_{n\to\infty}q(n)=7/5$.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov Modes and Linear Response of Jump-Diffusion Models: Applications to Stochastic Excitation of the ENSO Recharge Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of linear response theory for mixed jump-diffusion models, combining both Gaussian and L\'evy noise forcings that interact with the nonlinear dynamics. This class of models covers a broad range of stochastic chaos and complexity for which the jump-diffusion processes are a powerful tool to parameterize the missing physics or effects of the unresolved scales onto the resolved ones.
  By generalizing concepts such as Kolmogorov operators and Green's functions to this context, we derive fluctuation-dissipation relationships for such models. The system response can then be interpreted in terms of contributions from the eigenmodes of the Kolmogorov operator (Kolmogorov modes) decomposing the time-lagged correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics. The underlying formulas offer a fresh look on the intimate relationships between the system's natural variability and its forced variability.
  We apply our theory to a paradigmatic El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) subject to state-dependent jumps and additive white noise parameterizing intermittent and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, key factors in the actual ENSO phenomenon. Such stochastic parameterizations are shown to produce stochastic chaos with an enriched time-variability. The Kolmogorov modes encoding the latter are then computed, and our Green's functions formulas are shown to achieve a remarkable accuracy to predict the system's response to perturbations.
  This work enriches Hasselmann's program by providing a more comprehensive approach to climate modeling and prediction, allowing for accounting the effects of both continuous and discontinuous stochastic forcing. Our results have implications for understanding climate sensitivity, detection and attributing climate change, and assessing the risk of climate tipping points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute observables of the critical 3d Ising model to high precision by applying the numerical conformal bootstrap to mixed correlators of the leading scalar operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We obtain new precise determinations of scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon) = (0.518148806(24), 1.41262528(29))$ as well as OPE coefficients involving $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$. We also describe several improvements made along the way to algorithms and software tools for the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover the dynamics of particles with Gaussian core interactions across melting in pure and disordered two-dimensional (2D) systems. Intriguing signatures of cooperative motion of particles in string-like paths are found at low temperatures. Such a motion, while common to glasses and supercooled liquids, are realized here in traditional equilibrium phases, including in pure systems. We explore the interplay of such motion and impurities and report their repercussions on spatiotemporal correlations. In particular, cooperative motion seems to cause a departure from the diffusive dynamics, causing slow relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response strongly depends on the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. We study a family of possible block types for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Blocks that are centrally symmetric induce holographic order, such that mechanical compatibility (meaning that blocks do not impede each other's motion) implies bulk-boundary coupling. With them, one can design a compatible metamaterial that will deform in any desired texture only on part of its boundary. With blocks that break holographic order, we demonstrate how to design the deformation texture on the entire boundary. Correspondingly, the number of compatible holographic metamaterials scales exponentially with the boundary, while in non-holographic cases we show that it scales exponentially with the bulk.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Quantum Harmonic Otto Engine Under Hot Squeezed Thermal Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16115v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum harmonic Otto engine under a hot squeezed thermal reservoir with asymmetry between the two adiabatic branches introduced by considering different speeds of the driving protocols. In the first configuration, the driving protocol for the expansion stroke is sudden-switch in nature and compression stroke is driven adiabatically, while the second configuration deals with the converse situation. In both cases, we obtain analytic expressions for the upper bound on efficiency and efficiency at optimal work output, which reveals a significant difference between the two configurations. Additionally, we find that the maximum achievable efficiency in sudden expansion case is 1/2 only while it approaches unity for the sudden compression stroke. Further, we study the effect of increasing degree of squeezing on the efficiency and work output of the engine and indicate the optimal operational regime for both configurations under consideration. Finally, by studying the full phase-diagram of the Otto cycle we observe that the operational region of the engine mode grows with increasing squeezing at the expense of refrigeration regime.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Time Ordered Correlator for a Chaotic Many-Body Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the parametric representation of a chaotic many-body
  quantum system derived earlier, we calculate explicitly the
  large-time dependence and asymptotic value of the out-of-time
  correlator (OTOC) of that system. The dependence on time $t$ is
  determined by $\Delta t / \hbar$. Here $\Delta$ is the energy
  correlation width within which the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit
  conjecture applies. We conjecture that $\Delta$ is universally
  related to the leading Ljapunov coefficient of the corresponding
  classical system by $\Delta = \hbar \lambda_{\max}$. Then the
  large-time behavior of OTOC is given by the dimensionless parameter
  $\lambda_{\max} t$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity in the context of Schr\"odinger field theory in the grand canonic ensemble for the bosonic and fermionic cases. Specifically, we find that the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ satisfy the linear relations with respect to $n$. It is find that $\{b_n\}$ is independent of the chemical potentials while $\{a_n\}$ depends on the chemical potentials. The resulting Krylov complexities for both bosonic and fermionic cases behave similarly, which is due to the similar profiles of the square of the absolute values of the auto-correlation functions. In the late time, the Krylov complexity exhibits exponential growth with the asymptotic scaling significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of $\{b_n\}$, which is different from that in the relativistic field theory. We argue that this is because the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_n\}$ also contributes to the Krylov complexity.</description>

Abstract: Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 %. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>

      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimps reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena, and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthfully functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes, since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes may lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EAD and DAD, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired spikes. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DAD usually comes with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimps -- isoperiodic structures of the parameter space. However, in our system, the shrimps have an internal structure made of multiple periodicities, revealing a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could come in handy to unveil the features of heart myocytes behavior that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>On finite-temperature Fredholm determinants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-temperature deformation of the sine kernel Fredholm determinants acting on the closed contours. These types of expressions usually appear as static two-point correlation functions in the models of free fermions and can be equivalently presented in terms of Toeplitz determinants. The corresponding symbol, or the phase shift, is related to the temperature weight. We present an elementary way to obtain large-distance asymptotic behavior even when the phase shift has a non-zero winding number. It is done by deforming the original kernel to the so-called effective form factors kernel that has a completely solvable matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. This allows us to find explicitly the resolvent and address the subleading corrections. We recover Szego, Hartwig and Fisher, and Borodin-Okounkov asymptotic formulas.</description>

      <title>Mixing small proteins with lipids and cholesterol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many ternary mixtures composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids with cholesterol (Chol) exhibit a region of coexistence between liquid-disordered $(L_d)$ and liquid-ordered $(L_o)$ domains, bearing some similarities to lipid rafts in biological membranes. However, biological rafts also contain many proteins that interact with the lipids and modify the distribution of lipids. Here, we extend a previously published lattice model of ternary DPPC/DOPC/Chol mixtures by introducing a small amount of small proteins (peptides). We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the mixing phase behavior of the components as a function of the interaction parameter representing the affinity between the proteins and the saturated DPPC chains, and for different mixture compositions. At moderate fractions of DPPC, the system is in a two-phase $L_d+L_o$ coexistence, and the proteins exhibit a simple partition behavior between the phases that depends on the protein-lipid affinity parameter. At low DPPC compositions, the mixture is in $L_d$ phase with local nanoscopic ordered domains. Addition of proteins with sufficiently strong attraction to the saturated lipids can induce the separation of a distinct $L_o$ large domain with tightly-packed gel-like clusters of proteins and saturated lipids. Consistent with the theory of phase transitions, we observe that the domain sizes grow when the mixture composition is in the vicinity of the critical point. Our simulations show that the addition of a small amount of proteins to such mixtures can cause their size to grow even further, and lead to the formation of metastable dynamic $L_o$ domains with sizes comparable to biological rafts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a massless gas with a non-isotropic cross section is given in a homogeneous spacetime. By employing a trial solution, we construct a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments and solve this set exactly. Our analytical solution with nontrivial scattering angle dependence contained can be mapped onto the BKW solution of a homogeneous nonrelativistic gas of Maxwell molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a feasible region determined by physical requirements. The analytical solution with parameters within the feasible region admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Variational functional theory for coulombic correlations in the electric double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical coulombic correlation functional in one-loop (1L) and local-density-approximation (LDA) is derived for electrolyte solutions, starting from a first-principles many-body partition function. The 1L-LDA functional captures correlations between electrolyte ions and solvent dipoles, such as screening and solvation, that are ignored by conventional mean-field theories. This 1L-LDA functional introduces two parameters that can be tuned to the experimental dielectric permittivity and activity coefficients in the bulk electrolyte solution. The capabilities of the 1L-LDA functional for the description of metal-electrolyte interfaces are demonstrated by embedding the functional into a combined quantum-classical model. Here, the 1L-LDA functional leads to a more pronounced double-peak structure of the interfacial capacitance with higher peaks and shorter peak-to-peak distance, significantly improving the agreement with experimental data and showing that electrolyte correlation effects exert a vital impact on the capacitive response.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in 2d CFT: reflected entropy, RG flow, and information velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time evolution of entanglement entropy in generic chaotic many-body systems has an effective description in terms of a minimal membrane, characterised by a tension function. For 2d CFTs, a degenerate tension function reproduces several results regarding the dynamics of the entropy; this stands in contrast to higher dimensions where the tension is non-degenerate. In this paper we use holography to show that, in order to correctly capture the reflected entropy in 2d CFT, one needs to add an additional degree of freedom to the membrane description. Furthermore, we show that the conventional non-degenerate membrane tension function emerges upon introducing a relevant deformation of the CFT, dual to a planar BTZ black hole with scalar hair and with an interior Kasner universe. Finally, we also study the membrane description for reflected entropy and information velocity arXiv:1908.06993 in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the 3D diluted Ising model universality class in a mixture of two magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.</description>

      <title>Description length of canonical and microcanonical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (non-)equivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles is a central concept in statistical physics. Non-equivalence has recently been established in models with an extensive number of constraints, common, e.g., in network science, via a non-vanishing difference in relative entropy, corresponding to higher microcanonical log-likelihood per node. However, from a model selection perspective, comparing canonical and microcanonical models requires consideration of both log-likelihood and complexity. To compare both terms under the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, we compute the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) of binary canonical and microcanonical models, finding that (i) microcanonical models, though higher in likelihood, are always more complex, making the choice of model non-trivial. (ii) The optimal model choice depends on the empirical values of the constraints: the canonical model performs best when its fit to observed data exceeds its uniform average fit across all data. (iii) Notably, in the thermodynamic limit the difference in description length per node vanishes for the equivalent models considered but persists otherwise, showing that non-equivalence implies extensive differences between large canonical and microcanonical models. Finally, we compare the NML approach to Bayesian methods, showing that (iv) the choice of priors, while practically uninfluential in equivalent models, becomes crucial when an extensive number of constraints is enforced, possibly leading to very different outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In principle, the probability of configurations, determined by the system's partition function or wave function, encapsulates essential information about phases and phase transitions. Despite the exponentially large configuration space, we show that the generic correlation of distances between configurations, with a degree of freedom proportional to the lattice size, can probe phase transitions using importance sampling procedures like Monte Carlo simulations. The distribution of sampled distances varies significantly across different phases, suggesting universal critical behavior for uncertainty and participation entropy. For various classical spin models with different phases and transitions, finite-size analysis based on these quantities accurately identifies phase transitions and critical points. Notably, in all cases, the critical exponent derived from the uncertainty of distances equals the anomalous dimension governing real-space correlation decay. Thus, configuration space correlations, defined by distance uncertainties, share the same decay ratio as real-space correlations, determining the universality class of phase transitions. This work applies to diverse lattice models with different local degrees of freedom, e.g., two levels for Ising-like models, discrete multi-levels for q-state clock models, and continuous local levels for the XY model, offering a robust, alternative method for understanding complex phases and transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. Here, we discuss a much wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss structural and superconducting phase transitions and transitions between different states of matter, with implications for life processes. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. A byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs only. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, promote entropy increase. Based on this entropy increase and the associated increase of statistical probability, we conjecture that entropy increase is a selection principle for FPCs considered to be variable in earlier discussions.</description>

Abstract: Langevin dynamics simulations are used to analyze the static and dynamic properties of an {XY} model adapted to dimers forming on Si(001) surfaces. The numerics utilise high-performance parallel computation methods on GPUs. The static exponent $\nu$ of the symmetry-broken XY model is determined to $\nu = 1.04$. The dynamic critical exponent $z$ is determined to $z = 2.13$ and, together with $\nu$, shows the behavior of the Ising universality class. For time-dependent temperatures, we observe frozen domains and compare their size distribution with predictions from Kibble-Zurek theory. We determine a significantly larger quench exponent that shows little dependence on the damping or the symmetry-breaking field.</description>

      <title>Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings by Weak Paramagnetism of the Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sutherland considered the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin ring for all total spin sectors. He discovered that there is an instability at total spin $0$. The total spin 1 sector has a higher energy groundstate than the groundstate among spin singlets. He called this ``weak paramagnetism.''
  Some parts of Sutherland's analysis were obscure. There was a later reconsideration by Dhar and Shastry, who showed that Bloch wall states give a good approximation to the lowest energy eigenstates in each momentum sector. Unfortunately, their ansatz demonstrates no weak paramagnetism.
  The question resurfaced due to a conjecture called ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels,'' which Sutherland's weak paramagnetism falsifies. We show that Sutherland's finding is numerically validated for spin rings up to size $L=20$. We also show Dhar and Shastry's approximation is demonstrably inexact at total spin $0$, for theoretical reasons. We finally show that the single mode approximation together with a symmetry of the spin singlet can explain weak paramagnetism, heuristically.</description>

      <title>Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Certified algorithms for equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting observables in equilibrium states is a central yet notoriously hard question in quantum many-body systems. In the physically relevant thermodynamic limit, certain mathematical formulations of this task have even been shown to result in undecidable problems. Using a finite-size scaling of algorithms devised for finite systems often fails due to the lack of certified convergence bounds for this limit. In this work, we design certified algorithms for computing expectation values of observables in the equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians, both at zero and positive temperature. Importantly, our algorithms output rigorous lower and upper bounds on these values. This allows us to show that expectation values of local observables can be approximated in finite time, contrasting related undecidability results. When the Hamiltonian is commuting on a 2-dimensional lattice, we prove fast convergence of the hierarchy at high temperature and as a result for a desired precision $\varepsilon$, local observables can be approximated by a convex optimization program of quasi-polynomial size in $1/\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a type of collinear magnetism, that is in some aspects distinct from ferromagnetism and from conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin-split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Sampling of Operator Growth Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We put forward a Monte Carlo algorithm that samples the Euclidean time operator growth dynamics at infinite temperature. Crucially, our approach is free from the numerical sign problem for a broad family of quantum many-body spin systems, allowing for numerically exact and unbiased calculations. We apply this methodological headway to study the high-frequency dynamics of the mixed-field quantum Ising model (QIM) in one and two dimensions. The resulting quantum dynamics display rapid thermalization, supporting the recently proposed operator growth hypothesis. Physically, our findings correspond to an exponential fall-off of generic response functions of local correlators at large frequencies. Remarkably, our calculations are sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle logarithmic corrections of the hypothesis in one dimension. In addition, in two dimensions, we uncover a non-trivial dynamical crossover between two large frequency decay rates. Lastly, we reveal spatio-temporal scaling laws associated with operator growth, which are found to be strongly affected by boundary contributions.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of the Caldeira-Leggett model with non-equilibrium Gaussian reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-equilibrium version of the Caldeira-Leggett model in which a quantum particle is strongly coupled to a set of engineered reservoirs. The reservoirs are composed by collections of squeezed and displaced thermal modes, in contrast to the standard case in which the modes are assumed to be at equilibrium. The model proves to be very versatile. Strongly displaced/squeezed reservoirs can be used to generate an effective time dependence in the system Hamiltonian and can be identified as sources of pure work. In the case of squeezing, the time dependence is stochastic and breaks the fluctuation-dissipation relation, this can be reconciled with the second law of thermodynamics by correctly accounting for the energy used to generate the initial non-equilibrium conditions. To go beyond the average description and compute the full heat statistics, we treat squeezing and displacement as generalized Hamiltonians on a modified Keldysh contour. As an application of this technique, we show the quantum-classical correspondence between the heat statistics in the non-equilibrium Caldeira-Leggett model and the statistics of a classical Langevin particle under the action of squeezed and displaced colored noises. Finally, we discuss thermodynamic symmetries of the heat generating function, proving a fluctuation theorem for the energy balance and showing that the conservation of energy at the trajectory level emerges in the classical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-6e condensed phase in Kagome lattice superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Ginzburg-Landau theory for commensurate pair density wave (PDW) states in a hexagonal lattice system, relevant to the kagome superconductors $\rm{AV_3Sb_5}$. Compared to previous theoretical frameworks, the commensurate wave vectors permit additional symmetric terms in the free energy, altering the system's ground state and its degeneracy. In particular, we analyze topological defects in the energetically favorable $\psi_{\text{kagome}}$ ground state and find that kinks on domain walls can carry $1/3$ topological charges. We further establish a correspondence between the SC fluctuations in these states and an effective $J_1-J_2$ frustrated XY model on the emergent kagome lattice. By employing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the existence of a vestigial phase characterized by $1/3$ vortex-antivortex pairs in low temperatures with the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magnetoresistance oscillations observed in recent experiments [J. Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a higher derivative scalar field theory in the presence of a boundary and a classically marginal interaction. We first investigate the free limit where the scalar obeys the square of the Klein-Gordon equation. In precisely $d=6$ dimensions, modules generated by $d-2$ and $d-4$ dimensional primaries merge to form a staggered module. We compute the conformal block associated with this module and show that it is a generalized eigenvector of the Casimir operator. Next we include the effect of a classically marginal interaction that involves four scalar fields and two derivatives. The theory has an infrared fixed point in $d=6-{\epsilon}$ dimensions. We compute boundary operator anomalous dimensions and boundary OPE coefficients at leading order in the ${\epsilon}$ expansion for the allowed conformal boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Why hyperdensity functionals describe any equilibrium observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recent hyperdensity functional theory for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of soft matter systems [F. Samm\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.098201]. Hyperdensity functionals give access to the behaviour of arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. The approach is based on classical density functional theory applied to an extended ensemble using standard functional techniques. The associated formally exact generalized Mermin-Evans functional relationships can be represented accurately by neural functionals. These neural networks are trained via simulation-based supervised machine learning and they allow one to carry out efficient functional calculus using automatic differentiation and numerical functional line integration. Exact sum rules, including hard wall contact theorems and hyperfluctuation Ornstein-Zernike equations, interrelate the different correlation functions. We lay out close connections to hyperforce correlation sum rules [S. Robitschko et al., Commun. Phys. 7, 103 (2024); 10.1038/s42005-024-01568-y] that arise from statistical mechanical gauge invariance [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 217101 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.217101]. Further quantitative measures of collective self-organization are provided by hyperdirect correlation functionals and spatially resolved hyperfluctuation profiles. The theory facilitates to gain deep insight into the inherent structuring mechanisms that govern the behaviour of both simple and complex order parameters in coupled many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Transport of molecules via polymerization in chemical gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of molecules for chemical reactions is critically important in various cellular biological processes. Despite thermal diffusion being prevalent in many biochemical processes, it is unreliable for any sort of directed transport or preferential accumulation of molecules. In this paper we propose a strategy for directed motion in which the molecules are transported by active carriers via polymerization. This transport is facilitated by chemical/activity gradients which generate an effective drift of the polymers. By marginalizing out the active degrees of freedom of the system, we obtain an effective Fokker-Planck equation for the Rouse modes of such active-passive hybrid polymers. In particular, we solve for the steady state distribution of the center of mass and its mean first passage time to reach an intended destination. We focus on how the arrangement of active units within the polymer affect its steady-state and dynamic behaviour and how they can be optimized to achieve high accumulation or rapid motility.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

Abstract: A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different non-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the relaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the kinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently adapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass, momentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third nonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform shear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are computed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the transport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are also explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its theoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results and computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the comparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations. While the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the Boltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the case of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate dependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with increasing inelasticity in collisions.</description>
