      <title>Oral exams in introductory statistics class with non-native English speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oral exams are a powerful tool for educators to gauge student's learning. This is particularly important in introductory statistics classes where many students struggle to grasp a deep meaning of topics like $p$-values, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and more. These challenges are only heightened in a context where students are learning in a second language. In this paper, I share my experience administering oral exams to an introductory statistics class of non-native English speakers at a Japanese university. I explain the context of the university and course that the exam was given in, before sharing details about the two exams. Despite the challenges the students (and I myself) faced, the exams seemed to truly test their statistical knowledge and not merely their English proficiency, as I found little relationship between a student's English ability and performance. I close with encouragements and recommendations for practitioners hoping to implement these exams, all while keeping an eye towards the unique difficulties faced by students not learning in their mother tongue.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Agent Based Models: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of uncertainty quantification methods to agent-based models (ABMs) using a simple sheep and wolf predator-prey model. This work serves as a tutorial on how techniques like emulation can be powerful tools in this context. We also highlight the importance of advanced statistical methods in effectively utilising computationally expensive ABMs. Specifically, we implement stochastic Gaussian processes, Gaussian process classification, sequential design, and history matching to address uncertainties in model input parameters and outputs. Our results show that these methods significantly enhance the robustness, accuracy, and predictive power of ABMs.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Smooth Numbers for Harmonic Samples A Stein method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a de Bruijn type approximation for quantifying the content of m smooth numbers, derived from samples obtained through a probability measure over the set of integers less than or equal to n, with point mass function at k inversely proportional to k. Our analysis is based on a stochastic representation of the measure of interest, utilizing weighted independent geometric random variables. This representation is analyzed through the lens of Stein method for the Dickman distribution. A pivotal element of our arguments relies on precise estimations concerning the regularity properties of the solution to the Dickman Stein equation for heaviside functions, recently developed by Bhattacharjee and Schulte. Remarkably, our arguments remain mostly in the realm of probability theory, with Mertens first and third theorems standing as the only number theory estimations required.</description>
