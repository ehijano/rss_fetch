      <title>New insights into population dynamics from the continuous McKendrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article covers the continuous McKendrick model, which is key in epidemiology and population dynamics, developed by Anderson Gray McKendrick. It describes population age structure changes via birth and death rates as continuous functions, shedding light on population dynamics through differential equations. The article delves into the equations, boundary conditions, and survival rates, offering insights into disease progression and population dynamics. It aims for an asymptotic analysis of population dynamics using previous studies and illustrative examples. The main finding is that the population nears extinction only if the expected offspring per individual ($R$) is less than 1.</description>

      <title>Beyond level-1: Identifiability of a class of galled tree-child networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference of phylogenetic networks is of increasing interest in the genomic era. However, the extent to which phylogenetic networks are identifiable from various types of data remains poorly understood, despite its crucial role in justifying methods. This work obtains strong identifiability results for large sub-classes of galled tree-child semidirected networks. Some of the conditions our proofs require, such as the identifiability of a network's tree of blobs or the circular order of 4 taxa around a cycle in a level-1 network, are already known to hold for many data types. We show that all these conditions hold for quartet concordance factor data under various gene tree models, yielding the strongest results from 2 or more samples per taxon. Although the network classes we consider have topological restrictions, they include non-planar networks of any level and are substantially more general than level-1 networks -- the only class previously known to enjoy identifiability from many data types. Our work establishes a route for proving future identifiability results for tree-child galled networks from data types other than quartet concordance factors, by checking that explicit conditions are met.</description>
