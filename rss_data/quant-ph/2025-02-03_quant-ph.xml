      <title>Periodicity and absolute zeta functions of multi-state Grover walks on cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, are extensively studied for their applications in mathematics, quantum physics, and quantum information science. This study explores the periods and absolute zeta functions of Grover walks on cycle graphs. Specifically, we investigate Grover walks with an odd number of states and determine their periods for cycles with any number of vertices greater than or equal to two. In addition, we compute the absolute zeta functions of M-type Grover walks with finite periods. These results advance the understanding of the properties of Grover walks and their connection to absolute zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Length scale estimation of excited quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive quantum oscillators are finding increasing applications in proposals for high-precision quantum sensors and interferometric detection of weak forces. Although optimal estimation of certain properties of massive quantum oscillators such as phase shifts and displacements have strict counterparts in the theory of quantum estimation of the electromagnetic field, the phase space anisotropy of the massive oscillator is characterized by a length scale parameter that is an independent target for quantum estimation methods. We show that displaced squeezed states and excited eigenstates of a massive oscillator exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information for the length scale with respect to excitation number, and discuss asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimation allowing to achieve the predicted sensitivity. We construct a sequence of entangled states of two massive oscillators that provides a boost in length scale sensitivity equivalent to appending a third massive oscillator to a non-entangled system, and a state of $N$ oscillators exhibiting Heisenberg scaling with respect to the total energy.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform and Quantum Hashing for a Quantum Device with Arbitrary Qubits Connection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider quantum circuits for Quantum fingerprinting (quantum hashing) and quantum Fourier transform (QFT) algorithms. Quantum fingerprinting (quantum hashing) is a well-known technique for comparing large objects using small images. The QFT algorithm is a very popular technique used in many algorithms. We present a generic method for constructing quantum circuits for these algorithms for quantum devices with restrictions. Many quantum devices (for example, based on superconductors) have restrictions on applying two-qubit gates. The restrictions are presented by a qubits connection graph. Typically, researchers consider only the linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architecture, but current devices have more complex graphs. We present a method for arbitrary connected graphs that minimizes the number of CNOT gates in the circuit.
  The heuristic version of the method is fast enough and works with $O(n^5)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits. The certain version of the algorithm has an exponential time complexity that is $O(n^22^n)$. We compare quantum circuits built by our algorithm with quantum circuits optimized for specific graphs that are Linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, ``sun'' (a cycle with tails, presented by 16-qubit IBMQ device) and ``two joint suns'' (two joint cycles with tails, presented by 27-qubit IBMQ device). Our generic method gives similar results with little bit more CNOT gates. At the same time, our method allows us to construct a circuit for arbitrary connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>Real-time adaptation of quantum noise channel estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimates of noise channels for quantum gates are required for most error mitigation techniques and are desirable for informing quantum error correction decoders. These estimates can be obtained by resource-intensive off-line characterization techniques, but can become stale due to device drift and fluctuations. We propose a method to address this issue by performing real-time adaptation of noise channel estimates during the execution of a quantum algorithmic circuit using extended flag gadgets, mid-circuit measurements and Bayesian inference. We carry out analytical calculations and numerical simulations employing a Dirichlet prior distribution for the error rates in a Pauli channel to demonstrate and evaluate the technique, which can be seen as a protocol for real-time calibration of high-level gate error information.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical generation and design of quantum codes for resource-efficient loss-tolerant quantum communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop novel protocols for generating loss-tolerant quantum codes; these are central for safeguarding information against qubit losses, with most crucial applications in quantum communications. Contrary to current proposals, our method enables top-to-bottom fast encoding and decoding, thereby significantly reducing the additional losses due to the lagging and photon-reordering at the repeater stations. At the harwdare level, we show how to achieve this with a single quantum emitter equipped with a static feedback mechanism, which we leverage to engineer entangling gates between a fed-back qubit and multiple emitted qubits in parallel. In addition, analyzing typical patterns within the error-correction decoding graphs, we find optimizations of the code structure, which enable higher performance by also reducing the code size; these are based on the introduction of asymmetries in the code, which mimic the intrinsic adaptiveness of the recovery procedure. We show numerically that these improvements together significantly enhance the loss-correction performance, with major advantages in quantum repeater protocols, where the fast recovery scheme (decoding-encoding) allows for improved repeater rates with smaller photon numbers per code.</description>

      <title>Unitary Dilation Strategy Towards Efficient and Exact Simulation of Non-Unitary Quantum Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum systems with their environments often requires non-unitary operations, and mapping these to quantum devices often involves expensive dilations or prohibitive measurement costs to achieve desired precisions. Building on prior work with a finite-differences strategy, we introduce an efficient and exact single-ancilla unitary decomposition technique that addresses these challenges. Our approach is based on Lagrange-Sylvester interpolation, akin to analytical differentiation techniques for functional interpolation. As a result, we can exactly express any arbitrary non-unitary operator with no finite approximation error using an easily computable decomposition. This can lead to several orders of magnitude reduction in the measurement cost, which is highly desirable for practical quantum computations of open systems.</description>

      <title>Uniting Quantum Processing Nodes of Cavity-coupled Ions with Rare-earth Quantum Repeaters Using Single-photon Pulse Shaping Based on Atomic Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an architecture for remotely connecting cavity-coupled trapped ions via a quantum repeater based on rare-earth-doped crystals. The main challenge for its realization lies in interfacing these two physical platforms, which produce photons with a typical temporal mismatch of one or two orders of magnitude. To address this, we propose an efficient protocol that enables custom temporal reshaping of single-photon pulses whilst preserving purity. Our approach is to modify a commonly used memory protocol, called atomic frequency comb, for systems exhibiting inhomogeneous broadening like rare-earth-doped crystals. Our results offer a viable solution for uniting quantum processing nodes with a quantum repeater backbone.</description>

      <title>Generation and Teleportation of three and four particle W state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduced circuits for three- and four-particle quantum systems to generate W states with any arbitrary coefficients and phases. Subsequently, each qubit was transmitted separately through a four-qubit entangled channel. Before transmission, the sender performed pre-processing on their qubits to minimize the resources required for transmission. Additionally, the receiver applied post-processing using the ancilla qubit(s) to recover the final states. To further improve efficiency, it is preferable to implement the protocol in a bidirectional manner, as this allows the unknown qubits initially held by the users to be utilized ancilla qubit(s). Finally, we compared our protocol with similar works and validated the correctness of the protocol by simulating it using Qiskit, a tool provided by IBM.</description>

      <title>Observation of Photon Blockade in a Tavis-Cummings System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe blockade of microwave photons in a Tavis-Cummings system comprising a superconducting cavity and up to $N=3$ transmon qubits. The effect is characterized with photon number-resolving spectroscopy using an additional dispersively coupled transmon "witness" qubit to directly probe the cavity's photon number distribution. We first observe polariton formation with splitting proportional to $\sqrt{N}$, confirming the Tavis-Cummings coupling, and subsequently obtain sub-Poissonian cavity photon statistics when the cavity is driven at polariton frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quality of Service in quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomorrow's quantum networks will allow one to connect multiple users scattered around the world. The large distances separating the users as well as limited physical resources will require using different paths to exchange information. The resources can be then distributed over channels of different length and transmitted to the end's users. Optimizing the distribution of such resources over those channels is then a fundamental issue that must be considered to achieve efficient long-distance quantum communication. One can then think of a routing mechanism that assigns the available channels to the users across which they can share unencoded and encoded information. Here we explore the assignment issue of a router in a quantum aggregation scenario, in which the users exchange unencoded information. Then we consider that the information is encoded using an error correction code. We give a simple example for both cases with whom we estimate the fidelities of several different configurations.</description>

      <title>Embedding of Tree Tensor Networks into Shallow Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are being highlighted as key quantum algorithms for demonstrating quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are limited to executing shallow quantum circuits because of noise. However, the barren plateau problem, where the gradient of the loss function becomes exponentially small with system size, hinders this goal. Recent studies suggest that embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits and initializing the parameters can avoid the barren plateau. Yet, embedding tensor networks into quantum circuits is generally difficult, and methods have been limited to the simplest structure, Matrix Product States (MPSs). This study proposes a method to embed Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs), characterized by their hierarchical structure, into shallow quantum circuits. TTNs are suitable for representing two-dimensional systems and systems with long-range correlations, which MPSs are inadequate for representing. Our numerical results show that embedding TTNs provides better initial quantum circuits than MPS. Additionally, our method has a practical computational complexity, making it applicable to a wide range of TTNs. This study is expected to extend the application of VQAs to two-dimensional systems and those with long-range correlations, which have been challenging to utilize.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr\"odinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</description>

      <title>Quantum function secret sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum function secret sharing scheme in which the communication is exclusively classical. In this primitive, a classical dealer distributes a secret quantum circuit $C$ by providing shares to $p$ quantum parties. The parties on an input state $|\psi\rangle$ and a projection $\Pi$, compute values $y_i$ that they then classically communicate back to the dealer, who can then compute $\lVert \Pi C|\psi\rangle\rVert^2$ using only classical resources. Moreover, the shares do not leak much information about the secret circuit $C$. Our protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the {\em Cayley path}, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims. More concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$ which are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done by extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent to our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries, and we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security. Second, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the number of gates.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an optical cavity containing a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We successfully stabilized a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity incorporating a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator with the pulse-tube cryocooler running. In stark contrast to previous demonstrations where lasers were locked to the cavities, our setup locks the cavity to a laser. Our measurements of cavity length fluctuation suggest that the setup could stabilize a cavity up to a finesse of $1.2\times 10^4$ without the diamond and $5.8 \times10^3$ with the diamond crystal. The finesse with a diamond crystal of approximately 90 is primarily limited by the absorption loss inside the diamond.</description>

      <title>Calibrated hypergraph states: I calibrated hypergraph and multi qudit state monads</title>

Abstract: Hypergraph states are a special kind of multipartite states encoded by hypergraphs. They play a significant role in quantum error correction, measurement--based quantum computation, quantum non locality and entanglement. In a series of two papers, we introduce and study calibrated hypergraph states, a broad generalization of weighted hypergraph states codified by hypergraphs equipped with calibrations, an ample extension of weightings. We propose as a guiding principle that a constructive theory of hypergraph states must be based on a categorical framework for hypergraphs on one hand and multi qudit states on the other constraining hypergraph states enough to render the determination of their general structure possible. In this first paper, we introduce graded $\varOmega$ monads, concrete Pro categories isomorphic to the Pro category $\varOmega$ of finite von Neumann ordinals and equipped with an associative and unital graded multiplication, and their morphisms, maps of $\varOmega$ monads compatible with their monadic structure. We then show that both calibrated hypergraphs and multi qudit states naturally organize in graded $\varOmega$ monads. In this way, we lay the foundation for the construction of calibrated hypergraph state map as a special morphism of these $\varOmega$ monads in the companion paper.</description>

Abstract: Hypergraph states are a special kind of multipartite states encoded by hypergraphs relevant in quantum error correction, measurement--based quantum computation, quantum non locality and entanglement. In a series of two papers, we introduce and investigate calibrated hypergraph states, an extension of weighted hypergraph states codified by hypergraphs equipped with calibrations, a broad generalization of weightings. The guiding principle informing our approach is that a constructive theory of hypergraph states must be based on a categorical framework for both hypergraphs and multi qudit states constraining hypergraph states enough to render the determination of their general structure possible. In this second paper, we build upon the graded $\varOmega$ monadic framework worked out in the companion paper, focusing on qudits over a generic Galois ring. We explicitly construct a calibrated hypergraph state map as a special morphism of the calibrated hypergraph and multi qudit state $\varOmega$ monads. We further prove that the calibrated hypergraph states so yielded are locally maximally entangleable stabilizer states, elucidate their relationship to weighted hypergraph states, show that they reduce to the weighted ones in the familiar qubit case and prove through examples that this is no longer the case for higher qudits.</description>

      <title>Quantum SMOTE with Angular Outliers: Redefining Minority Class Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Quantum-SMOTEV2, an advanced variant of the Quantum-SMOTE method, leveraging quantum computing to address class imbalance in machine learning datasets without K-Means clustering. Quantum-SMOTEV2 synthesizes data samples using swap tests and quantum rotation centered around a single data centroid, concentrating on the angular distribution of minority data points and the concept of angular outliers (AOL). Experimental results show significant enhancements in model performance metrics at moderate SMOTE levels (30-36%), which previously required up to 50% with the original method. Quantum-SMOTEV2 maintains essential features of its predecessor (arXiv:2402.17398), such as rotation angle, minority percentage, and splitting factor, allowing for tailored adaptation to specific dataset needs. The method is scalable, utilizing compact swap tests and low depth quantum circuits to accommodate a large number of features. Evaluation on the public Cell-to-Cell Telecom dataset with Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Classifier, and Neural Network (NN) illustrates that integrating Angular Outliers modestly boosts classification metrics like accuracy, F1 Score, AUC-ROC, and AUC-PR across different proportions of synthetic data, highlighting the effectiveness of Quantum-SMOTEV2 in enhancing model performance for edge cases.</description>

      <title>On the application of a Silicon photomultiplier-based receiver for binary phase-shift-keying protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, binary phase-shift keying %communication encoding has been used as a benchmark to test the performance of different detection strategies to address the problem of state discrimination. In this context, hybrid devices, giving access to both particle- and wave-like properties of light, could offer the possibility to better discriminate the sent signals. In this work, we consider a %communication quantum channel exploiting a hybrid receiver embedding Silicon photomultipliers as photon-number-resolving detectors. We retrieve the discrimination error probability and the mutual information between sender and receiver as functions of some relevant experimental parameters in the case of binary phase-shifted coherent states. Our promising results, supported also with numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, foster further using this kind of hybrid receiver in more complex detections schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Internet Use Case Analysis for the Automotive Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A future quantum internet brings promising applications related to security, privacy and enabling distributed quantum computing. Integration of these concepts into the future trends of the automotive sector is of considerable interest, as it enables both the development of practical quantum internet use cases and the adoption of innovative technologies in the automotive sector. In this work we analyze cross-platform megatrends in both the quantum internet and the automotive industry, identifying mutually beneficial regions of interest. In the short-term ($&lt;10$ years) hardware miniaturization and automation of quantum internet technology provides a synergy interface between the two domains. For the long-term ($\geq10$ years) we develop a comprehensive list of use cases for the quantum internet within the automotive sector. We find considerable relevancy of augmenting autonomous driving, vehicle ad hoc networks and sensor fusion with blind quantum computing, anonymous transmission and quantum cryptographic tools. These results can be used to target future research, engineering and venture developments for both domains. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to other industries, enabling a structured methodology for identifying and developing feasible use cases for the quantum internet in diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Exact Floquet solutions in a Parity-Time-Symmetric Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a semiclassical Rabi model with parity-time (PT) symmetry has a hidden $sl(2)$ symmetry and hence possesses quasi-exact solutions. These are located precisely at the exceptional points of the spectrum, the boundaries of the PT-symmetric phase. The corresponding constraints on the model parameters can be interpreted as a resonance relationship between the constant and periodic driving terms.</description>

      <title>VeloxQ: A Fast and Efficient QUBO Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VeloxQ, a fast and efficient solver for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are central to numerous real-world optimization tasks. Unlike other physics-inspired approaches to optimization problems, such as quantum annealing and quantum computing, VeloxQ does not require substantial progress of technology to unlock its full potential. We benchmark VeloxQ against the state-of-the-art QUBO solvers based on emerging technologies. Our comparison includes quantum annealers, specifically D-Wave's Advantage, and Advantage2 prototype platforms, the digital-quantum algorithm designed to solve Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) developed by Kipu Quantum, physics-inspired algorithms: Simulated Bifurcation and Parallel Annealing and an algorithm based on tropical tensor networks. We also take into account modern developments of conventional algorithms: Branch and Bound algorithm, an optimal implementation of the brute-force algorithm and BEIT QUBO solver. Our results show that VeloxQ not only matches but often surpasses the mentioned solvers in solution quality and runtime. Additionally, VeloxQ demonstrates excellent scalability being the only solver capable of solving large-scale optimization problems, including up to $2\times 10^{8}$ sparsely connected variables, that are currently intractable for its competitors. These findings position VeloxQ as a powerful and practical tool for tackling large-scale QUBO and HUBO problems, offering a compelling alternative to existing quantum and classical optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Sampling Groups of Pauli Operators to Enhance Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct fidelity estimation is a protocol that estimates the fidelity between an experimental quantum state and a target pure state. By measuring the expectation values of Pauli operators selected through importance sampling, the method is exponentially faster than full quantum state tomography. We propose an enhanced direct fidelity estimation protocol that uses fewer copies of the experimental state by grouping Pauli operators before the sampling process. We derive analytical bounds on the measurement cost and estimator variance, showing improvements over the standard method. Numerical simulations validate our approach, demonstrating that for 8-qubit Haar-random states, our method achieves a one-third reduction in the required number of copies and reduces variance by an order of magnitude using only local measurements. These results underscore the potential of our protocol to enhance the efficiency of fidelity estimation in current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Electron-beam-induced quantum interference effects in a multi-level quantum emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy has recently emerged as a novel platform for nanoscale control of nonclassical features of light. Here, we propose a theoretical model for cathodoluminescence from a multi-level quantum emitter. Employing a master equation approach and treating the electron-beam excitation as an incoherent broadband field source, we show that quantum interference can arise between the different relaxation pathways. The induced-interference can significantly modify the time-dependent spectra resulting in the enhancement or suppression of cathodoluminescence. We find that the excitation rate, initial state of the emitter, and excited level spacing play a crucial role in determining the influence of interference. Our findings shed light on electron-beam-induced quantum interference in cathodoluminescence and provides a theoretical basis for exploring quantum optical phenomena in electron-driven multi-level systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Readout of Coherent Nuclear Spins Beyond the NV Center Electron T$_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is an emerging platform for constructing inertial sensors. Its native nitrogen spin can serve as a gyroscope using Ramsey interferometry protocols. The sensitivities of these nuclear-spin-based NV gyroscopes are limited by the phase coherence time of the nuclear spin, which is in turn limited by the $T_1$ of the NV center's electron spin. There is an active research effort to decouple the nuclear spin from the electron spin and other sources of decoherence to extend the phase coherence time past the NV center electron $T_1$. However, this presents an associated challenge -- how to readout of the nuclear spin ensemble if the electronic spins have relaxed into a thermal state. We introduce an optical repump pulse to repolarize electron spins and investigate its effect on the readout of nuclear spins in this regime. We find for ensemble-based sensors, our readout protocol has around a six-fold improvement in sensitivity around the excited state anti-level crossing at 500 G compared to low fields (200 G), despite the presence of deleterious spin flip-flop dynamics in the excited state.</description>

      <title>How Random Are Ergodic Eigenstates of the Ultrametric Random Matrices and the Quantum Sun Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the extreme-value statistics of the Schmidt eigenvalues of reduced density matrices obtained from the ergodic eigenstates. We start by exploring the extreme value statistics of the ultrametric random matrices and then the related Quantum Sun Model, which is also a toy model of avalanche theory. It is expected that these ergodic eigenstates are purely random and thus possess random matrix theory-like features, and the corresponding eigenvalue density should follow the universal Marchenko-Pastur law. Nonetheless, we find deviations, specifically near the tail in both cases. Similarly, the distribution of maximum eigenvalue, after appropriate centering and scaling, should follow the Tracy-Widom distribution. However, our results show that, for both the ultrametric random matrix and the Quantum Sun model, it can be better described using the extreme value distribution. As the extreme value distribution is associated with uncorrelated or weakly correlated random variables, the results hence indicate that the Schmidt eigenvalues exhibit much weaker correlations compared to the strong correlations typically observed in Wishart matrices. Similar deviations are observed for the case of minimum Schmidt eigenvalues as well . Despite the spectral statistics, such as nearest neighbor spacing ratios, aligning with the random matrix theory predictions, our findings reveal that randomness is still not fully achieved. This suggests that deviations in extreme-value statistics offer a stringent test to probe the randomness of ergodic eigenstates and can provide deeper insights into the underlying structure and correlations in ergodic systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Stabilizer entropies of random bipartite pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

      <title>Benchmark of the Full and Reduced Effective Resistance Kernel for Molecular Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the commute time kernel method via the effective resistance framework analyzing the quantum complexity of the originally classical approach. Our study reveals that while there is a trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, significant improvements can be achieved in terms of runtime efficiency without substantially compromising on precision. Our investigation highlights a notable quantum speedup in calculating the kernel, which offers a quadratic improvement in time complexity over classical approaches in certain instances. In addition, we introduce methodical improvements over the original work on the commute time kernel and provide empirical evidence suggesting the potential reduction of kernel queries without significant impact on result accuracy. Benchmarking our method on several chemistry-based datasets: $\tt{AIDS}$, $\tt{NCL1}$, $\tt{PTC-MR}$, $\tt{MUTAG}$, $\tt{PROTEINS}$ - data points previously unexplored in existing literature, shows that while not always the most accurate, it excels in time efficiency. This makes it a compelling alternative for applications where computational speed is crucial. Our results highlight the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and speedup offered by quantum computing, promoting further research into efficient algorithms for kernel methods and their applications in chemistry-based datasets.</description>

      <title>Addressing the correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In resonance fluorescence excitation experiments, light emitted from solid-state quantum emitters is typically filtered to eliminate the laser photons, ensuring that only red-shifted Stokes photons are detected. Theoretical analyses of the fluorescence intensity correlation often model emitters as two-level systems, focusing on light emitted exclusively from the purely electronic transition (the Zero-Phonon Line), or rely on statistical approaches based on conditional probabilities that do not account for quantum coherences. Here, we propose a general model to characterize the correlation of either Zero-Phonon Line photons or Stokes-shifted photons. This model successfully reproduces the experimental correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two interacting molecules and predicts that this correlation is affected by quantum coherence. Besides, we analyze the role of quantum coherence in light emission from two uncorrelated emitters, which helps to clarify the discrepancy between theory and experiments regarding the value of the correlation of photons emitted from this system at zero delay time.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function that is commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability, efficiency, and generalization.</description>

      <title>Unconventional high-temperature excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and analyze its superfluid properties. In particular, we estimate BKT temperatures between 75 K and 100 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic spin correlations and spectral pairing in Floquet time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet time crystals are characterized by subharmonic behavior of temporal correlation functions. Studying the paradigmatic time crystal based on the disordered Floquet quantum Ising model, we show that its temporal spin correlations are directly related to spectral characteristics and that this relation provides analytical expressions for the correlation function of finite chains, which compare favorably with numerical simulations. Specifically, we show that the disorder-averaged temporal spin correlations are proportional to the Fourier transform of the splitting distribution of the pairs of eigenvalues of the Floquet operator, which differ by $\pi$ to exponential accuracy in the chain length. We find that the splittings are well described by a log-normal distribution, implying that the temporal spin correlations are characterized by two parameters. We discuss possible implications for the phase diagram of the Floquet time crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel. This work unlocks new ways of controlling topological phononic phases at the nanoscale with applications in noise management and information processing.</description>

Abstract: While quantum computing holds immense potential for tackling previously intractable problems, its current practicality remains limited. A critical aspect of realizing quantum utility is the ability to efficiently interface with data from the classical world. This research focuses on the crucial phase of quantum encoding, which enables the transformation of classical information into quantum states for processing within quantum systems. We focus on three prominent encoding models: Phase Encoding, Qubit Lattice, and Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) for cost and efficiency analysis. The aim of quantifying their different characteristics is to analyze their impact on quantum processing workflows. This comparative analysis offers valuable insights into their limitations and potential to accelerate the development of practical quantum computing solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit interactions generated by time-dependent electric fields acting on weak links (that couple together non-magnetic macroscopic leads) can magnetize the junction. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local information objectivity, that local observers can infer the same information about a model upon exchange of experimental data, is fundamental to science. It is mathematically encoded via Cencov's theorem: the Fisher information metric is the unique metric invariant under sufficient statistics. However, quantum gravity typically violates some of the Cencov assumptions, allowing the Fisher metric and Born rule to vary between observers. We explain these violations, some possible experimental tests, and a new quantum gravity approach based on generally covariant information geometry.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is arguably one of the most explored applications of near-term quantum devices. Much focus has been put on notions of variational quantum machine learning where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are used as learning models. These PQC models have a rich structure which suggests that they might be amenable to efficient dequantization via random Fourier features (RFF). In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which RFF does indeed provide an efficient dequantization of variational quantum machine learning for regression. We build on these insights to make concrete suggestions for PQC architecture design, and to identify structures which are necessary for a regression problem to admit a potential quantum advantage via PQC based optimization.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Fisher information (QFI) bounds the sensitivity of a quantum measurement, heralding the conditions for quantum advantages when compared with classical strategies. Here, we calculate analytical expressions for the QFI of nonlinear interferometers under lossy conditions and with coherent-state seeding. We normalize the results based on the number of photons going through the sample that induces a phase shift on the incident quantum state, which eliminates some of the previously declared metrological advantages. We analyze the performance of nonlinear interferometers in a variety of geometries and robustness of the quantum advantage with respect to internal and external loss through direct comparison with a linear interferometer. We find the threshold on the internal loss at which the quantum advantage vanishes, specify when and how much coherent-state seeding optimally counters internal loss, and show that a sufficient amount of squeezing confers to the quantum advantages robustness against external loss and inefficient detection.</description>

Abstract: We investigate for optimal photon absorption a quantum electrodynamical model of an inhomogeneously-broadened spin ensemble coupled to a single-mode cavity. Solutions to this problem under experimental assumptions are developed in the Schr\"odinger picture without using perturbation theory concerning the cavity-spin interactions. Furthermore, we exploit the possibility of modulating the frequency and coupling rate of the resonator. We consider a one-photon input pulse and show some optimal scenarios, where exact formulas and numerical results are obtained for the absorption probabilities and the optimal pulse shapes. In particular, if the external loss dominates the internal loss of the cavity, we find the optimal cooperativity for different parameters and identify cases where absorption with a success probability larger than $99%$ is achieved.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space ${\mathbf {CP}}^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin $j$ for a generic $j$ (a $2j+1$-state system) is represented instead by a point of a larger space, ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$. Here we study the state of a single angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The special class of states $ | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle \in {\mathbf {CP}}^{2j} $, with spin oriented towards definite spatial directions ${\mathbf n} \in S^2$, i.e., $({\mathbf J}\cdot {\mathbf n} ) \, | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle = j\, |j, {\mathbf n}\rangle $, are found to behave as classical angular momenta, $j \, {\mathbf n}$, in this limit. Vice versa, general spin states in ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$ do not become classical, even at large $j$. We discuss these questions, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach processes, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. Our observations help to clarify better how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in this context (e.g., with unique trajectories for a particle carrying a large spin), and to make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, more precise.</description>

      <title>Demonstrations of system-bath physics on gate-based quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic cooling can be used to find correlated states of many-body quantum systems. It is based on quantum circuits that perform non-unitary operations, whose implementation can be challenging on near-term quantum computers. In this work we develop a method that uses inherent qubit noise to implement non-unitary operations and algorithmic cooling. In our approach, qubit decay during quantum computation is used to simulate dissipation of auxiliary-spin bath, which cools down a simulated system towards its ground state. We test the algorithm on IBM-Q devices and demonstrate the relaxation of system spins to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering, controlled by the definition of the system Hamiltonian. The ordering is stable as long as the algorithm is run. We are able to perform cooling and state stabilization for global systems of up to three system spins and four auxiliary spins. Our work paves the way for useful quantum simulations of many-body quantum systems on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Nonlinear Dynamics: Revisiting Carleman Linearization with No Dissipative Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the embedding of nonlinear dynamical systems into linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via the Carleman linearization method. Under dissipative conditions, numerous previous works have established rigorous error bounds and linear convergence for Carleman linearization, which have facilitated the identification of quantum advantages in simulating large-scale dynamical systems. Our analysis extends these findings by exploring error bounds beyond the traditional dissipative condition, thereby broadening the scope of quantum computational benefits to a new class of dynamical regimes. This novel regime is defined by a resonance condition, and we prove how this resonance condition leads to a linear convergence with respect to the truncation level $N$ in Carleman linearization. We support our theoretical advancements with numerical experiments on a variety of models, including the Burgers' equation, Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chains, and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, to validate our analysis and demonstrate the practical implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that causal contextuality scenarios are equivalent to a subset of the formerly published spacetime games, which generalize game theory to decisions arbitrarily located in Minkowski spacetime. This insight leads to certain constructs and proofs being shorter, simpler, and more intuitive when expressed in the spacetime game framework than in the causal contextuality scenario framework. This shows that the insights of both frameworks taken together can contribute positively to advancing the field of quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Private Quantum Channels and Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. With the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight, while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted authenticated BB84 protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work delivers a novel user-server authentication procedure exploiting the features of maximally entangled pairs in both an idealistic noiseless scenario and a moderately noisy one. Additionally, we leverage the specific features of our design, which are conveniently suited for inlaying it into the well known BB84 quantum communication protocol. We first define a trivial extension of our initial proposal allowing for such task (symmetric scheme) to then come up with what we denote as asymmetric scheme, better matching practicality.
  Furthermore, a realistic simulation of the user-server authentication protocol has been achieved by employing a noisy model for both transmission and storage, the latter relying on cavity-enhanced atomic-frequency comb (AFC) memories. While in a noiseless scenario our proposal is ensured to be airtight, considering a certain degree of noise poses a challenge when aiming to actually implement it. We have implemented a deep neural network to distinguish legitimate users from forgery attempts, outperforming a mere statistical approach designed for the same task. Such method achieved a success rate of 0.75 with storage times of $1$ $\mu s$ and a user-server distance of $10$ km.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudorandom states (PRSs) are state ensembles that cannot be efficiently distinguished from Haar random states. However, the definition of PRSs has been limited to pure states and lacks robustness against noise. Here, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of $n$-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble (GHSE), which is constructed from $(n+m)$-qubit Haar random states with $m$ qubits traced out. For $m=0$, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for $m=\omega(\log n)$, PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. PRDMs with $m=\omega(\log n)$ are robust to unital noise channels and separated in terms of security from PRS. PRDMs disguise valuable quantum resources, possessing near-maximal entanglement, magic and coherence, while being computationally indistinguishable from resource-free states. PRDMs exhibit a pseudoresource gap of $\Theta(n)$ vs $0$, surpassing previously found gaps. We also render EFI pairs, a fundamental cryptographic primitive, robust to strong mixed unitary noise. Our work has major implications on quantum resource theory: We show that entanglement, magic and coherence cannot be efficiently tested, and that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory, as well as noise-robust quantum money. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.</description>

      <title>Solving Caldeira-Leggett Model by Inchworm Method with Frozen Gaussian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm that combines the inchworm method and the frozen Gaussian approximation to simulate the Caldeira-Leggett model in which a quantum particle is coupled with thermal harmonic baths. In particular, we are interested in the real-time dynamics of the reduced density operator. In our algorithm, we use frozen Gaussian approximation to approximate the wave function as a wave packet in integral form. The desired reduced density operator is then written as a Dyson series, which is the series expression of path integrals in quantum mechanics of interacting systems. To compute the Dyson series, we further approximate each term in the series using Gaussian wave packets, and then employ the idea of the inchworm method to accelerate the convergence of the series. The inchworm method formulates the series as an integro-differential equation of "full propagators", and rewrites the infinite series on the right-hand side using these full propagators, so that the number of terms in the sum can be significantly reduced, and faster convergence can be achieved. The performance of our algorithm is verified numerically by various experiments.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Approach to Logical Qubit Fidelities of Neutral Atom CSS Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code enhances protection against errors. Imperfection of quantum devices due to decoherence effects will limit the fidelity of quantum gate operations. In particular, neutral atom quantum computers will suffer from correlated errors because of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states that facilitate entanglement. Predicting the impact of such errors on the performance of topological QEC codes is important in understanding and characterising the fidelity limitations of a real quantum device. Mapping a QEC code to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with disorder allows us to use Monte Carlo techniques to calculate upper bounds on error rates without resorting to an optimal decoder. In this Article, we adopt this statistical mapping to predict error rate thresholds for neutral atom architecture, assuming radiative decay to the computational basis, leakage and atom loss as the sole error sources. We quantify this error rate threshold $p_\text{th}$ and bounds on experimental constraints, given any set of experimental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are fundamental across modern science and engineering, appearing in models that span virtually all physical scales. A critical property for the robustness and stability of computational methods in such systems is the symplectic structure, which preserves geometric properties like phase-space volume over time and energy conservation over an extended period. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms that incorporate symplectic integrators, ensuring the preservation of this key structure. We demonstrate how these algorithms maintain the symplectic properties for both linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the computational complexity, showing that our approach offers both accuracy and improved efficiency over classical algorithms. These results highlight the potential application of quantum algorithms for solving large-scale Hamiltonian systems while preserving essential physical properties.</description>

      <title>How to Build a Quantum Supercomputer: Scaling from Hundreds to Millions of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the span of four decades, quantum computation has evolved from an intellectual curiosity to a potentially realizable technology. Today, small-scale demonstrations have become possible for quantum algorithmic primitives on hundreds of physical qubits and proof-of-principle error-correction on a single logical qubit. Nevertheless, despite significant progress and excitement, the path toward a full-stack scalable technology is largely unknown. There are significant outstanding quantum hardware, fabrication, software architecture, and algorithmic challenges that are either unresolved or overlooked. These issues could seriously undermine the arrival of utility-scale quantum computers for the foreseeable future. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of these scaling challenges. We show how the road to scaling could be paved by adopting existing semiconductor technology to build much higher-quality qubits, employing system engineering approaches, and performing distributed quantum computation within heterogeneous high-performance computing infrastructures. These opportunities for research and development could unlock certain promising applications, in particular, efficient quantum simulation/learning of quantum data generated by natural or engineered quantum systems. To estimate the true cost of such promises, we provide a detailed resource and sensitivity analysis for classically hard quantum chemistry calculations on surface-code error-corrected quantum computers given current, target, and desired hardware specifications based on superconducting qubits, accounting for a realistic distribution of errors. Furthermore, we argue that, to tackle industry-scale classical optimization and machine learning problems in a cost-effective manner, heterogeneous quantum-probabilistic computing with custom-designed accelerators should be considered as a complementary path toward scalability.</description>

      <title>Boundaries for quantum advantage with single photons and loop-based time-bin interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop-based boson samplers interfere photons in the time degree of freedom using a sequence of delay lines. Since they require few hardware components while also allowing for long-range entanglement, they are strong candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage beyond the reach of classical emulation. We propose a method to exploit this loop-based structure to more efficiently simulate such systems. Our algorithm exploits a causal-cone argument to decompose the circuit into smaller effective components that can each be simulated sequentially by calling a state vector simulator as a subroutine. To quantify the complexity of our approach, we develop a new lattice path formalism that allows us to efficiently characterize the state space that must be tracked during the simulation. In addition, we develop a heuristic method that allows us to predict the expected average and worst-case memory requirements of running these simulations. We use these methods to compare the simulation complexity of different families of loop-based interferometers, allowing us to quantify the potential for quantum advantage of single-photon Boson Sampling in loop-based architectures.</description>

Abstract: The approach of direct integration of the three-dimensional Faddeev equations with respect to the breakup T-matrix in momentum space for three bodies of different masses is presented. The Faddeev equations are written out explicitly without the requirement for symmetry or antisymmetry of two-body t matrices, taking into account the difference in the masses of three interacting particles. An algorithm for the algebraic search for non-relativistic wave functions of a system of three bodies of different masses is described. A significant change in the domain of logarithmic singularities of the integral kernels of the Faddeev equations from the choice of masses of interacting particles is demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: We study one-flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice QCD in ($1+1$) dimensions at zero temperature and finite density using matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. We compute physical observables such as the equation of state, chiral condensate, and quark distribution function as functions of the baryon number density. As a physical implication, we discuss the inhomogeneous phase at nonzero baryon density, where the chiral condensate is inhomogeneous, and baryons form a crystal. We also discuss how the dynamical degrees of freedom change from hadrons to quarks through the formation of quark Fermi seas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has led to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent the ground state of quantum many-body systems, including fermionic systems. However, efficiently integrating lattice symmetries into neural representations remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in fermionic wavefunctions and demonstrate its ability to target both ground states and low-lying excitations. Using group-equivariant neural backflow transformations, we study the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling. Our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves ground-state energies and yields accurate low-energy excitations for lattices up to 10 x 10. We also compute accurate two-point density-correlation functions and the structure factor to identify phase transitions and critical points. These findings introduce a symmetry-aware framework important for studying quantum materials and phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We discuss impurities in a one-dimensional Bose gas with arbitrary boson-boson and boson-impurity interactions. To fully account for quantum effects, we employ numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and - in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions - the mapping to weakly interacting fermions. A mean-field description of the Bose polaron based on coupled Gross-Pitaevski -- Schr\"odinger equations predicts the existence of a self-localized polaron. We here show that such a solution does not exist and is an artifact of the underlying decoupling approximation. To this end we consider a mobile impurity in a box potential. Our work demonstrates that correlations between the impurity position and the bosons are important even in the limit where mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore we derive analytical approximations for the energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary interaction strengths and large but finite boson-boson couplings which accurately reproduce DMRG results. This demonstrates that the polaron problem of a heavy impurity in a 1D Bose gas can be accurately approximated by a proper mean-field description plus a linearized treatment of quantum fluctuations for arbitrary boson-boson and impurity-boson couplings. Finally we determine the polaron-polaron interaction potential $V(r)$ in Born-Oppenheimer approximation for small and intermediate distances $r$, which in the Tonks gas limit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Formation, prevalence, and stability of bouncing-ball quantum scars</title>

Abstract: Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schr\"odinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>A novel quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that, the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small, and future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as the precision tests of the SM advances, rarer processes with a greater number of final-state particles will require consideration, which will in turn require the analysis of a multitude of observables. As an inherent consequence of the high luminosity, the generation of a large amount of experimental data in a large feature space presents a significant challenge for data processing. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm; the VQSN, however, introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As an example, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the gluon quartic gauge couplings~(gQGCs) at the Large Hadron Collider. The results suggest that VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</description>

      <title>Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames. The broader conceptual implications concern the influence of observers in physics and possible physical limits to objectivity.</description>

      <title>Crosscap Quenches and Entanglement Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the "crosscap quench", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network Toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems, including gauge theories, without encountering sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</description>
