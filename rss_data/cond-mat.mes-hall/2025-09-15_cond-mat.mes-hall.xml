      <title>Dimensionality reduction of optically generated vortex strings in a charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In phase transitions, mesoscale structures such as topological defects, vortex strings, and domain walls control the path towards equilibrium, and thus the functional properties of many active devices. In photoinduced phase transitions driven by femtosecond laser excitation, the temporal (pulse duration) and spatial (penetration depth) structure of the optical excitation present opportunities for control and creating structures with unique topologies. By performing time-resolved optical pump, x-ray probe experiments on the CDW system Pd-intercalated ErTe$_{3}$, we gain access to the nanoscale dynamics of the mesoscale topological features (vortex strings) produced after a quench, which have a different apparent dimensionality than the topological defects predicted from the bulk system. We show that these vortex strings persist for much longer than the electronic recovery time. The critical exponent obtained from power-law scaling of the intensity as a function of wavevector shows a reduction in the effective dimensionality of the topological defects in the system, corroborated by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway to use light to control the dimensionality and orientation of topological defects in quantum materials, which could be used to stabilize competing quantum states.</description>

      <title>Fractal growth of higher-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding crystal growth and morphology is a fundamental issue in condensed matter physics. In this work, we reveal the fractal morphology of growing crystals of higher-order topological insulators and show that the corners of the crystals grow preferentially compared to the edges in the presence of the corner states. We further demonstrate that when we compare the crystal shape of the higher-order topological insulator with that of the trivial insulator with the same value of the fractal dimension $D_f$, the former has a smaller value of the fractal dimension of coastlines $D_{f,c}$ than the latter. This indicates that, for crystals with a similar degree of corner development, those in the higher-order topological phase have smoother edges. Because the relationship between the area and the perimeter of the crystals is governed by the ratio of these fractal dimensions, the higher-order topological insulator and the trivial insulator exhibit distinct perimeter-area relationships.</description>

      <title>Hard and soft phase slips in a Fabry-P\'erot quantum Hall interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometers are sensitive to the properties of bulk quasiparticles enclosed by the interferometer loop, with the interference phase containing information about both the quasiparticle statistics and the Coulomb-mediated bulk-edge coupling. Previous studies have explored the role of the bulk-edge coupling in an equilibrium picture where quasiparticles enter and exit the interferometer rapidly compared to the timescale over which the interferometer phase is measured. Here, we present data from a monolayer graphene quantum Hall interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime at $\nu = -1$ and $\nu = -2$. Quantum interference shows phase slips associated with the entrance of quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. Tracing the dependence of these phase slips on the magnetic field, we show that the equilibration time can become as long as several minutes. We further use our multi-gated geometry to identify two classes of phase slips. The first is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle to a bulk `puddle' of quasiparticles uniformly coupled to the entire chiral edge state, while the second is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle trapped by a defect site that couples predominantly to the closest portion of the edge.</description>

      <title>Switching magnetic texture via in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnets: From skyrmions to antiskyrmions and nontopological magnetic bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate field-induced switching of magnetic topology in a nanodisk-shaped sample of noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnet in which the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that stabilizes an antiskyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=+1 and the magnetic dipole interaction that stabilizes a skyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$ are in keen competition where $N_{\rm sk}$ is the skyrmion number. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the competition offers a unique opportunity to switch magnetic textures with distinct magnetic topology among the antiskyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=+1), elliptical skyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$), and nontopological bubble ($N_{\rm sk}$=0) in a deterministic manner by application of magnetic fields parallel to the sample plane. By calculating time and spatial profiles of energy contributions from respective interactions and magnetic anisotropy, we clarify the physical mechanism and properties of the observed field-induced topology switching phenomena. Our findings are expected to provide useful insights into the spintronic application of topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Electrical Transport in SnSe$_2$ Nanosheets: Role of Thickness and Surface Defect States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the influence of thickness on the electrical transport properties of mechanically exfoliated two-dimensional SnSe$_2$ nanosheets, derived from the bulk single crystal. Contrary to conventional trend observed in two-dimensional systems, we find a semiconducting to metallic resistivity behavior with decreasing thickness. The analysis of low-temperature conduction indicates an increased density of states at Fermi-level with decreasing thickness, which is further corroborated by gate bias dependent conductance measurement. The enhanced conductivity in thinner flake is attributed to the n-type doping arising from surface defect states. The presence and evolution of these defect states with thickness is probed by thickness-dependent room-temperature Raman spectroscopy. Our study provides insights into the thickness-dependent electronic transport mechanism of SnSe$_2$ and the crucial role of defect states in governing the observed conductivity behavior.</description>

      <title>Noncontact friction in ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators near dielectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro- and nanomechanical resonators are emerging as promising platforms for quantum technologies, precision sensors and fundamental science experiments. To utilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be brought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or efficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in nanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has led to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties. The mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and nanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature, setting their force sensitivities below 1 $\mathrm{aN}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, surpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given this new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity of other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We report a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent nanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By studying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is more severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric loss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries static charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction (NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the integration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the adverse effects of charged defects in these systems.</description>

      <title>Pure dephasing increases partition noise in the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall edge channels partition electric charge over N chiral (uni-directional) modes. Intermode scattering leads to partition noise, observed in graphene p-n junctions. While inelastic scattering suppresses this noise by averaging out fluctuations, we show that pure (quasi-elastic) dephasing may enhance the partition noise. The noise power increases by up to 50% for two modes, with a general enhancement factor of 1+1/N in the strong-dephasing limit. This counterintuitive effect is explained in the framework of monitored quantum transport, arising from the self-averaging of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Spin-qubit Noise Spectroscopy of Magnetic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using spin-qubit noise magnetometry to probe dynamical signatures of magnetic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics. For a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to two-dimensional XY magnets, we predict distinctive features in the magnetic noise spectral density in the sub-MHz to GHz frequency range. In the quasi-long-range ordered phase, the spectrum exhibits a temperature-dependent power law characteristic of algebraic spin correlations. Above the transition, the noise reflects the proliferation of free vortices and enables quantitative extraction of the vortex conductivity, a key parameter of vortex transport. These results highlight NV as a powerful spectroscopic method to resolve magnetic dynamics in the mesoscopic and low-frequency regimes and to probe exotic magnetic phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Disorder-driven Weyl-Kondo Semimetal Phase in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the observation of disorder-driven anisotropic Kondo screening and spontaneous Hall effect in bulk WTe${_2}$, a nonmagnetic type-II Weyl semimetal. We show that Kondo scattering emerges more prominently in disordered samples and produces magnetoresistance that is strongly anisotropic with respect to both current and magnetic field orientation, reflecting the underlying type-II Weyl dispersion. Strikingly, we find a spontaneous Hall effect in zero magnetic field, whose magnitude is enhanced with disorder, together with a large second-harmonic Hall signal exhibiting quadratic current scaling. Our analysis indicates that disorder-driven Kondo interactions pin the Fermi level near the Weyl nodes. This enhances the Berry curvature-driven nonequilibrium transport, accounting for both the second-order and spontaneous Hall responses. These findings establish disordered WTe${_2}$ as a platform hosting Weyl-Kondo fermions and highlight disorder as an effective control knob for inducing correlated topological phases in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Scaling High-Performance Nanoribbon Transistors with Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale transistors require aggressive reduction of all channel dimensions: length, width, and thickness. While monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors (2DS) offer ultimate thickness scaling, good performance has largely been achieved only in micrometer-wide channels. Here, we demonstrate both $\it{n}$- and $\it{p}$-type nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer 2DS, fabricated using a multi-patterning process, reaching channel widths down to 25 nm and lengths down to 50 nm. 'Anchored' contacts improve device yield, while nanoscale imaging, including tip-enhanced photoluminescence, reveals minimal edge degradation. The devices reach on-state currents up to 560, 420, and 130 $\mu$A $\mu$m$^{-1}$ at 1 V drain-to-source voltage for $\it{n}$-type MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$, and $\it{p}$-type WSe$_{2}$, respectively, integrated with thin high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. These results surpass prior reports for single-gated nanoribbons, the WS$_{2}$ by over 100 times, even in normally-off (enhancement-mode) transistors. Taken together, these findings suggest that top down patterned 2DS nanoribbons are promising building blocks for future nanosheet transistors.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains engineered from semiconducting quantum dots coupled by superconducting segments offer a promising route to realize and control Majorana bound states for topological quantum computation. We study a dimerized Kitaev chain--equivalent to a superconducting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model--and analyze the behavior of the resulting two coupled chains. We show that interference between Majorana edge modes from each chain gives rise to observable signatures in nonlocal conductance. Additionally, we identify a parity effect in the system length that governs the coupling of edge states, supported by an analytical model. Our results provide experimentally accessible probes for Majorana hybridization in mesoscopic topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Slow quasiparticle dynamics and anyonic statistics in a fractional quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyons are particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, their exchange statistics can be measured in the edge-state Fabry-P\'erot interferometer. In these devices, the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp}\theta_a$ to the interference signal. Here we report the observation of large, hysteretic phase jumps in a monolayer graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu=1/3$. When the filling factor is increased from $\nu&lt;1/3$ towards the center of the plateau, we observe phase slips with magnitude $\Delta \theta \approx 2\pi/3$, consistent with the addition of individual quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, the phase slips occur as instantaneous jumps in the interference signal, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes. We use this long timescale to investigate the effect of changes in interferometer area $A_I$ and $N_{QP}$ independently at fixed magnetic field, revealing a striking memory effect in the phase slip magnitude. In particular, as the $\nu=1/3$ plateau is approached from higher filling, we observed phase slips with $\Delta \theta$ significantly larger than $2\pi/3$ over the same range of gate voltage where quantized jumps are seen for increasing $\nu$. We discuss this asymmetry in terms of bulk-edge coupling of quasiparticles localized near the edge or in the bulk, and argue that this effect can be qualitatively reconciled with theoretical expectations for strongly interacting quasiparticles in the presence of weak disorder and strongly nonequilibrium charge dynamics. Our results highlight the key role played by charge dynamics on signatures of the anyon phase, and demonstrate that fractional quasiparticles can be indefinitely localized in nonequilibrium configurations.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and experimental TDPAC approach enlightening the $aftereffects$ phenomenon: probing electronic properties in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$:($^{111}$In$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd at the atomic scale</title>

Abstract: By means of an integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and double-approach experimental study we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process has stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and check experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale photonic neuron with biological signal processing</title>

Abstract: Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same architecture as a compact, modular front end</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</title>

Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $&gt;90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between quantum magnetism and many-body physics is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics. %Magnetic exchange interactions in frustrated lattices give rise to rich phase diagrams. Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for exploring the exotic quantum phases arising from complex orderings in frustrated lattices. Here we demonstrate a showcase system based on altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks, which can be constructed from a C$_{40}$ molecular synthon with two effective spin-1/2 sites due to the resonance structures. The charge-neutral, pure-carbon systems exhibit an altermagnetic ground state with fully compensated spins arranged in alternating C$_{40}$ units in a 2D rutile-like lattice, leading to $d$-wave splitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnons. We report a rich phase diagram including altermagentic, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be accessed via moderate strains. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring quantum many-body physics based on scalable, chemically-feasible, molecular quantum materials.</description>
