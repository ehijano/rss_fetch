      <title>Comments on "Federated Learning with Differential Privacy: Algorithms and Performance Analysis"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper by Wei et al. ("Federated Learning with Differential Privacy: Algorithms and Performance Analysis"), the convergence performance of the proposed differential privacy algorithm in federated learning (FL), known as Noising before Model Aggregation FL (NbAFL), was studied. However, the presented convergence upper bound of NbAFL (Theorem 2) is incorrect. This comment aims to present the correct form of the convergence upper bound for NbAFL.</description>

      <title>Towards Computational Performance Engineering for Unsupervised Concept Drift Detection -- Complexities, Benchmarking, Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept drift detection is crucial for many AI systems to ensure the system's reliability. These systems often have to deal with large amounts of data or react in real-time. Thus, drift detectors must meet computational requirements or constraints with a comprehensive performance evaluation. However, so far, the focus of developing drift detectors is on inference quality, e.g. accuracy, but not on computational performance, such as runtime. Many of the previous works consider computational performance only as a secondary objective and do not have a benchmark for such evaluation. Hence, we propose and explain performance engineering for unsupervised concept drift detection that reflects on computational complexities, benchmarking, and performance analysis. We provide the computational complexities of existing unsupervised drift detectors and discuss why further computational performance investigations are required. Hence, we state and substantiate the aspects of a benchmark for unsupervised drift detection reflecting on inference quality and computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate performance analysis practices that have proven their effectiveness in High-Performance Computing, by tracing two drift detectors and displaying their performance data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Energy Efficiency in Deep Learning: Measurement, Prediction, and Scoring across Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, deep learning optimization is primarily driven by research focused on achieving high inference accuracy and reducing latency. However, the energy efficiency aspect is often overlooked, possibly due to a lack of sustainability mindset in the field and the absence of a holistic energy dataset. In this paper, we conduct a threefold study, including energy measurement, prediction, and efficiency scoring, with an objective to foster transparency in power and energy consumption within deep learning across various edge devices. Firstly, we present a detailed, first-of-its-kind measurement study that uncovers the energy consumption characteristics of on-device deep learning. This study results in the creation of three extensive energy datasets for edge devices, covering a wide range of kernels, state-of-the-art DNN models, and popular AI applications. Secondly, we design and implement the first kernel-level energy predictors for edge devices based on our kernel-level energy dataset. Evaluation results demonstrate the ability of our predictors to provide consistent and accurate energy estimations on unseen DNN models. Lastly, we introduce two scoring metrics, PCS and IECS, developed to convert complex power and energy consumption data of an edge device into an easily understandable manner for edge device end-users. We hope our work can help shift the mindset of both end-users and the research community towards sustainability in edge computing, a principle that drives our research.
