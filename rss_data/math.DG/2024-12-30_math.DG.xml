      <title>Bicycle tracks with hyperbolic monodromy -- results and conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find new necessary and sufficient conditions for the bicycling monodromy of a closed plane curve to be hyperbolic. Our main tool is the ``hyperbolic development" interpretation of the bicycling monodromy of plane curves. Based on computer experiments, we pose two conjectures concerning the bicycling monodromy of strictly convex closed plane curves.</description>

      <title>Wulff inequality for minimal submanifolds in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Wulff inequality for $n$-dimensional minimal submanifolds with boundary in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$, where we associate a nonnegative anisotropic weight $\Phi: S^{n+m-1}\to \mathbb{R}^{+}$ to the boundary of minimal submanifolds. The Wulff inequality constant depends only on $m$ and $n$, and is independent of the weights. The inequality is sharp if $m=1, 2$ and $\Phi$ is the support function of ellipsoids or certain type of centrally symmetric long convex bodies.</description>

      <title>The total absolute curvature of submanifolds with singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a generalization of the Chern-Lashof theorem for submanifolds with singularities called frontals in Euclidean space. We prove that, for an $n$-dimensional admissible compact frontal in $(n+r)$-dimensional Euclidean space $\boldsymbol{R}^{n+r}$, its total absolute curvature is greater than or equal to the sum of the Betti numbers. Furthermore, if the total absolute curvature is equal to $2$, and all singularities are of the first kind, then the image of the frontal coincides with a closed convex domain of an affine $n$-dimensional subspace of $\boldsymbol{R}^{n+r}$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness in the local Donaldson-Scaduto conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local Donaldson-Scaduto conjecture predicts the existence and uniqueness of a special Lagrangian pair of pants with three asymptotically cylindrical ends in the Calabi-Yau 3-fold $X \times \mathbb{R}^2$, where $X$ is an ALE hyperk\"ahler 4-manifold of $A_2$-type. The existence of this special Lagrangian has previously been proved. In this paper, we prove a uniqueness theorem, showing that no other special Lagrangian pair of pants satisfies this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Topology of closed asymptotic curves on negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Nirenberg's problem on isometric rigidity of tight surfaces, we study closed asymptotic curves $\Gamma$ on negatively curved surfaces $M$ in Euclidean $3$-space. In particular, using C\u{a}lug\u{a}reanu's theorem, we obtain a formula for the linking number $Lk(\Gamma,n)$ of $\Gamma$ with the normal $n$ of $M$. It follows that when $Lk(\Gamma, n)=0$, $\Gamma$ cannot have any locally star-shaped planar projections with vanishing crossing number, which extends observations of Kovaleva, Panov and Arnold. These results hold also for curves with nonvanishing torsion and their binormal vector field. Furthermore we construct an example where $n$ is injective but $Lk(\Gamma, n)\neq 0$, and discuss various restrictions on $\Gamma$ when $n$ is injective.</description>

      <title>Lower Ricci Curvature Bounds and the Orientability of Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study orientability in spaces with Ricci curvature bounded below. Building on the theory developed by Honda, we establish equivalent characterizations of orientability for Ricci limit and RCD spaces in terms of the orientability of their manifold part. We prove a new stability theorem and, as a corollary, we deduce that four-manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below and volume non-collapsing are uniformly locally orientable. As a global counterpart of the latter, we show that four-manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth are orientable.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger operators with non-integer power-law potentials and Lie-Rinehart algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators $H:= -\Delta + V$ with potentials $V$ that have power-law growth (not necessarily polynomial) at 0 and at $\infty$ using methods of Lie theory (Lie-Rinehart algebras) and microlocal analysis. More precisely, we show that $H$ is ''generated'' in a certain sense by an explicit Lie-Rinehart algebra. This allows then to construct a suitable (microlocal) calculus of pseudodifferential operators that provides further properties of $H$. Classically, this microlocal analysis method was used to study $H$ when the power-laws describing the potential $V$ have integer exponents. Thus, the main point of this paper is that this integrality condition on the exponents is not really necessary for the microlocal analysis method to work. While we consider potentials following (possibly non-integer) power-laws both at the origin and at infinity, our results extend right away to potentials having power-law singularities at several points. The extension of the classical microlocal analysis results to potentials with non-integer power-laws is achieved by considering the setting of Lie-Rinehart algebras and of the continuous family groupoids integrating them. (The classical case relies instead on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of the absolute boundary problem for the Hodge-Laplacian is presented as a union of the spectra of the absolute boundary problem on the spaces of closed and co-exact forms. An inequality for the eigenvalues of the absolute boundary problem for Hodge-Laplacian and Dirichlet boundary problem for the Laplace-Beltrami operator is obtained using this presentation.</description>

      <title>Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann Eigenvalues on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Sigma$ in a Riemannian surface $M$ satisfying certain curvature condition, we prove that for any $k \geq 1,$ we have $$\mu_{k+2-\beta_1} \leq \lambda_{k},$$ where $\mu_k$ ($\lambda_k$ resp.) is the $k$-th Neumann (Dirichlet resp.) Laplacian eigenvalue on $\Sigma$ and $\beta_1$ is the first Betti number of $\Sigma.$ This extends previous results on the Euclidean space to curved surfaces, including the flat cylinder, the hyperbolic plane, hyperbolic cusp, funnel, etc. The novelty of the paper lies in comparing Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacian eigenvalues via the variational principle of the Hodge Laplacian on $1$-forms on a surface, extending the variational principle on vector fields in the Euclidean plane as developed by Rohleder. The comparison is reduced to the existence of a distance function with appropriate curvature conditions on its level sets.</description>

      <title>On dual-projectively equivalent connections associated to second order superintegrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In projective differential geometry, pre-geodesics of an affine connection are curves that are geodesics after a reparametrization (the analogous concept in K\"ahler geometry is known as $J$-planar curves). Similarly, dual-geodesics on a Riemannian manifold are curves along which the $1$-forms associated to the velocity are preserved after a reparametrization. Superintegrable systems are Hamiltonian systems with a large number of independent constants of the motion. They are said to be second order if the constants of the motion can be chosen to be quadratic polynomials in the momenta. Famous examples include the Kepler-Coulomb and the harmonic oscillator systems, which are foundational models in the Sciences. We show that certain torsion-free affine connections which are naturally associated to certain second order superintegrable systems share the same dual-geodesics.</description>

      <title>Revisit Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds of dimension 6 with 4 fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the circle acts in a Hamiltonian way on a compact symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$, then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. The case that there are exactly $n+1$ isolated fixed points has its importance due to various reasons. Besides dimension 2 with 2 fixed points, and dimension 4 with 3 fixed points, which are known, the next interesting case is dimension 6 with 4 fixed points, for which the integral cohomology ring and the total Chern class of the manifold, and the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points are classified by Tolman. In this note, we use a new different argument to prove Tolman's results for the dimension 6 with 4 fixed points case. We observe that the integral cohomology ring of the manifold has a nice basis in terms of the moment map values of the fixed points, and the largest weight between two fixed points is nicely related to the first Chern class of the manifold. We will use these ingredients to determine the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points, and moreover to determine the global invariants the integral cohomology ring and total Chern class of the manifold. The idea allows a direct approach of the problem, and the argument is short and easy to follow.</description>

      <title>An Approximated Model of Wildfire Propagation on Slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires underscore the need for accurate predictive models to enhance wildfire management. Traditional models, such as Rothermel and FARSITE, provide foundational insights but often oversimplify the complex dynamics of wildfire spread. Advanced methods, employing sophisticated mathematical techniques, offer more precise modeling by accounting for real-world complexities and dynamic environmental factors.
  This paper focuses on wildfire propagation over inclined terrains and combines the Rothermel model, Huygens' principle, and advanced mathematical techniques to provide a more precise model of propagation. Environmental parameters and vegetation factors are directly incorporated into formulas and equations to improve the reliability and effectiveness of wildfire management strategies. The practical application of these results is demonstrated through MATLAB simulations, specifically examining wildfire spread under wind conditions that do not impede upwind fire advancement. The findings of this work contribute to both wildfire research and the development of more effective management strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modifications of standard general relativity that bring torsion into a game have a long-standing history. However, no convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the torsion shall be excluded from the consideration. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. In this paper, we review the construction of the Geroch--Hansen multipole moments for stationary asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. Based on Geroch's approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments behave under such transformations.</description>

      <title>Differentiable groupoid objects and their abstract Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infinitesimal counterpart of a Lie groupoid is its Lie algebroid. As a vector bundle, it is given by the source vertical tangent bundle restricted to the identity bisection. Its sections can be identified with the invariant vector fields on the groupoid, which are closed under the Lie bracket. We generalize this differentiation procedure to groupoid objects in any category with an abstract tangent structure in the sense of Rosick\'{y} and a scalar multiplication by a ring object that plays the role of the real numbers. We identify the categorical conditions that the groupoid object must satisfy to admit a natural notion of invariant vector fields. Then we show that invariant vector fields are closed under the Lie bracket defined by Rosick\'{y} and satisfy the Leibniz rule with respect to ring-valued morphisms on the base of the groupoid. The result is what we define axiomatically as an abstract Lie algebroid, by generalizing the underlying vector bundle to a module object in the slice category over its base. Examples include diffeomorphism groups, bisection groups of Lie groupoids, the diffeological symmetry groupoids of general relativity (Blohmann/Fernandes/Weinstein), symmetry groupoids in Lagrangian Field Theory, holonomy groupoids of singular foliations, elastic diffeological groupoids, and groupoid objects in differentiable stacks.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Approximations to Ricci-flat Metrics Via Extrinsic Symmetries of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ever since Yau's non-constructive existence proof of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds, finding their explicit construction remains a major obstacle to development of both string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel neural representations for approximating these metrics, offering high accuracy but limited interpretability. In this paper, we analyse machine learning approximations to flat metrics of Fermat Calabi-Yau n-folds and some of their one-parameter deformations in three dimensions in order to discover their new properties. We formalise cases in which the flat metric has more symmetries than the underlying manifold, and prove that these symmetries imply that the flat metric admits a surprisingly compact representation for certain choices of complex structure moduli. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art reductions in Ricci curvature for multiple Calabi-Yau manifolds. We conclude by distilling the ML models to obtain for the first time closed form expressions for Kahler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>On effective uniformization of 2-sphere and the stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a proof of effective uniformization for nearly round 2-spheres, utilizing an identity related to the third-order differential of the conformal factor. This identity is connected to the geometry of the embedded spacelike surface within the Minkowski lightcone. Additionally, we investigate the stability of the effective uniformization introduced by Klainerman and Szeftel. Our proof is based on a geometric insight: an isometric embedding of a round sphere into Euclidean space can be constructed using an orthogonal basis of the first eigenspace of the Laplacian operator, with the rectangular coordinates corresponding to the basis functions. By adopting these approaches, we simplify both the proofs of effective uniformization and its stability, while also refining the assumptions underlying both results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a 1-connected non-conformally flat conformal Lorentzian manifold $(M,c)$ admits a connected essential transitive group of conformal transformations, then there exists a metric $g\in c$ such that $(M,g)$ is a complete homogeneous plane wave. This finishes the classification of 1-connected Lorentzian manifolds, which admit transitive essential conformal group. We also prove that the group of conformal transformations of a non-conformally flat 1-connected homogeneous plane wave $(M,g)$ consists of homotheties, and it is a 1-dimensional extension of the group of isometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1509.06344v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss several old and new methods for mapping a circular disc to a square. In particular, we present analytical expressions for mapping each point (u,v) inside the circular disc to a point (x,y) inside a square region. Ideally, we want the mapping to be smooth and invertible. In addition, we put emphasis on mappings with desirable properties. These include conformal, equiareal, and radially-constrained mappings. Finally, we present applications to logo design, panoramic photography, and hyperbolic art.</description>

      <title>The prescribed curvature flow on the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For given functions $f$ and $j$ on the disc $B$ and its boundary $\partial B=S^1$, we study the existence of conformal metrics $g=e^{2u}g_0$ with prescribed Gauss curvature $K_g=f$ and boundary geodesic curvature $k_g=j$. Using the variational characterization of such metrics obtained by Cruz-Blazquez and Ruiz (2018), we show that there is a canonical negative gradient flow of such metrics, either converging to a solution of the prescribed curvature problem, or blowing up to a spherical cap. In the latter case, similar to our work Struwe (2005) on the prescribed curvature problem on the sphere, we are able to exhibit a $2$-dimensional shadow flow for the center of mass of the evolving metrics from which we obtain existence results complementing the results recently obtained by Ruiz (2021) by degree-theory.</description>

      <title>Blow-up Whitney forms, shadow forms, and Poisson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Whitney forms on a simplex $T$ admit high-order generalizations that have received a great deal of attention in numerical analysis. Less well-known are the shadow forms of Brasselet, Goresky, and MacPherson. These forms generalize the Whitney forms, but have rational coefficients, allowing singularities near the faces of $T$. Motivated by numerical problems that exhibit these kinds of singularities, we introduce degrees of freedom for the shadow $k$-forms that are well-suited for finite element implementations. In particular, we show that the degrees of freedom for the shadow forms are given by integration over the $k$-dimensional faces of the blow-up $\tilde T$ of the simplex $T$. Consequently, we obtain an isomorphism between the cohomology of the complex of shadow forms and the cellular cohomology of $\tilde T$, which vanishes except in degree zero. Additionally, we discover a surprising probabilistic interpretation of shadow forms in terms of Poisson processes. This perspective simplifies several proofs and gives a way of computing bases for the shadow forms using a straightforward combinatorial calculation.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold for a family of Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the popularization of the Stiefel manifold for numerical applications in 1998 in a seminal paper from Edelman et al., it has been exhibited to be a key to solve many problems from optimization, statistics and machine learning. In 2021, H\"uper et al. proposed a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics on the Stiefel manifold, subsuming the well-known Euclidean and canonical metrics. Since then, several methods have been proposed to obtain a candidate for the Riemannian logarithm given any metric from the family. Most of these methods are based on the shooting method or rely on optimization approaches. For the canonical metric, Zimmermann proposed in 2017 a particularly efficient method based on a pure matrix-algebraic approach. In this paper, we derive a generalization of this algorithm that works for the one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics. The algorithm is proposed in two versions, termed backward and forward, for which we prove that it conserves the local linear convergence previously exhibited in Zimmermann's algorithm for the canonical metric.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Reachability on Riemannian Manifolds for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear system is critically important for autonomous trajectory planning for reach-avoid applications and safety critical scenarios. Providing the reachable set is generally impossible when the dynamics are unknown, so we calculate underapproximations of such sets using local dynamics at a single point and bounds on the rate of change of the dynamics determined from known physical laws. Motivated by scenarios where an adverse event causes an abrupt change in the dynamics, we attempt to determine a provably reachable set of states without knowledge of the dynamics. This paper considers systems which are known to operate on a manifold. Underapproximations are calculated by utilizing the aforementioned knowledge to derive a guaranteed set of velocities on the tangent bundle of a complete Riemannian manifold that can be reached within a finite time horizon. We then interpret said set as a control system; the trajectories of this control system provide us with a guaranteed set of reachable states the unknown system can reach within a given time. The results are general enough to apply on systems that operate on any complete Riemannian manifold. To illustrate the practical implementation of our results, we apply our algorithm to a model of a pendulum operating on a sphere and a three-dimensional rotational system which lives on the abstract set of special orthogonal matrices.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Complex Structures for the Full Quantum Flag Manifold of Quantum SU(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent work, Lusztig's positive root vectors (with respect to a distinguished choice of reduced decomposition of the longest element of the Weyl group) were shown to give a quantum tangent space for every $A$-series Drinfeld--Jimbo full quantum flag manifold $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{F}_n)$. Moreover, the associated differential calculus $\Omega^{(0,\bullet)}_q(\mathrm{F}_n)$ was shown to have classical dimension, giving a direct $q$-deformation of the classical anti-holomorphic Dolbeault complex of $\mathrm{F}_n$. Here we examine in detail the rank two case, namely the full quantum flag manifold of $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{SU}_3)$. In particular, we examine the $*$-differential calculus associated to $\Omega^{(0,\bullet)}_q(\mathrm{F}_3)$ and its non-commutative complex geometry. We find that the number of almost-complex structures reduces from $8$ (that is $2$ to the power of the number of positive roots of $\frak{sl}_3$) to $4$ (that is $2$ to the power of the number of simple roots of $\frak{sl}_3$). Moreover, we show that each of these almost-complex structures is integrable, which is to say, each of them is a complex structure. Finally, we observe that, due to non-centrality of all the non-degenerate coinvariant $2$-forms, none of these complex structures admits a left $\mathcal{O}_q(\mathrm{SU}_3)$-covariant noncommutative K\"ahler structure.</description>
