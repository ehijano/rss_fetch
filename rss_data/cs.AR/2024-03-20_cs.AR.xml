      <title>HCiM: ADC-Less Hybrid Analog-Digital Compute in Memory Accelerator for Deep Learning Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM) accelerators are increasingly recognized for their efficiency in accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, their dependence on Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) for accumulating partial sums from crossbars leads to substantial power and area overhead. Moreover, the high area overhead of ADCs constrains the throughput due to the limited number of ADCs that can be integrated per crossbar. An approach to mitigate this issue involves the adoption of extreme low-precision quantization (binary or ternary) for partial sums. Training based on such an approach eliminates the need for ADCs. While this strategy effectively reduces ADC costs, it introduces the challenge of managing numerous floating-point scale factors, which are trainable parameters like DNN weights. These scale factors must be multiplied with the binary or ternary outputs at the columns of the crossbar to ensure system accuracy. To that effect, we propose an algorithm-hardware co-design approach, where DNNs are first trained with quantization-aware training. Subsequently, we introduce HCiM, an ADC-Less Hybrid Analog-Digital CiM accelerator. HCiM uses analog CiM crossbars for performing Matrix-Vector Multiplication operations coupled with a digital CiM array dedicated to processing scale factors. This digital CiM array can execute both addition and subtraction operations within the memory array, thus enhancing processing speed. Additionally, it exploits the inherent sparsity in ternary quantization to achieve further energy savings. Compared to an analog CiM baseline architecture using 7 and 4-bit ADC, HCiM achieves energy reductions up to 28% and 12%, respectively</description>

      <title>DL2Fence: Integrating Deep Learning and Frame Fusion for Enhanced Detection and Localization of Refined Denial-of-Service in Large-Scale NoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a refined Flooding Injection Rate-adjustable Denial-of-Service (DoS) model for Network-on-Chips (NoCs) and more importantly presents DL2Fence, a novel framework utilizing Deep Learning (DL) and Frame Fusion (2F) for DoS detection and localization. Two Convolutional Neural Networks models for classification and segmentation were developed to detect and localize DoS respectively. It achieves detection and localization accuracies of 95.8\% and 91.7\%, and precision rates of 98.5\% and 99.3\% in a 16x16 mesh NoC. The framework's hardware overhead notably decreases by 76.3\% when scaling from 8x8 to 16x16 NoCs, and it requires 42.4\% less hardware compared to state-of-the-arts. This advancement demonstrates DL2Fence's effectiveness in balancing outstanding detection performance in large-scale NoCs with extremely low hardware overhead.</description>
