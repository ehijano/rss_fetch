      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations favor a pure deflagration origin of the near-Chandrasekhar mass supernova remnant 3C 397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suzaku X-ray observations of the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 discovered exceptionally high mass ratios of Mn/Fe, Ni/Fe, and Cr/Fe, consistent with a near $M_{\rm Ch}$ progenitor white dwarf (WD). The Suzaku observations have established 3C 397 as our best candidate for a near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ SNR Ia, and opened the way to address additional outstanding questions about the origin and explosion mechanism of these transients. In particular, subsequent XMM-Newton observations revealed an unusually clumpy distribution of iron group elemental (IGE) abundances within the ejecta of 3C 397. In this paper, we undertake a suite of two dimensional hydrodynamical models, varying both the explosion mechanism -- either deflagration-to-detonation (DDT), or pure deflagration -- WD progenitors, and WD progenitor metallicity, and analyze their detailed nucleosynthetic abundances and associated clumping. We find that pure deflagrations naturally give rise to clumpy distributions of neutronized species concentrated towards the outer limb of the remnant, and confirm DDTs have smoothly structured ejecta with a central concentration of neutronization. Our findings indicate that 3C 397 was most likely a pure deflagration of a high central density WD. We discuss a range of implications of these findings for the broader SN Ia progenitor problem.</description>

      <title>Tracing the evolving X-ray reverberation lags within an individual AGN light curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Granger causality (GC) test for the X-ray reverberation analysis of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). If the light curves in the continuum-dominated band help predict (Granger cause) those dominated by reflection, the Granger lags that associate to the intrinsic reverberation lags can be inferred. We focus on six AGN observed by XMM-Newton, including the sources well-known to exhibit clear X-ray reverberation lags (IRAS 13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495) and those in which reverberation signatures are not well confirmed (MCG-6-30-15, IZW1, Mrk 704 and Mrk 1040). We employ the sliding-window algorithm and estimate the Granger (intrinsic) Fe-L lags along the light curve as the window moves through. This reveals the evolving lags towards the end of some individual observations, suggesting that the corona varies progressively. Occasionally, we observe two clearly separate lags that suggest an extended corona consisting of two zones while producing competing reverberation of two lags. While the GC test is purely hypothetical and might not explain true causality, our conclusion is that the lags are present and could be understood as reverberation lags. Assuming the lags changing solely with the corona, we find that the IRAS 13224-3809 corona varies between $\sim 10$-$25$ $r_{\rm g}$ and sometimes move to $\gtrsim 50$ $r_{\rm g}$. The corona of 1H 0707-495 and MCG-6-30-15 may be analogous to that of IRAS 13224-3809, while in IZw1, Mrk 704 and Mrk 1040 a more compact corona is expected.</description>

      <title>On Innermost Stable Spherical Orbits near a rotating black hole: A numerical study of the particle motion near the plunging region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to General Relativity, astrophysical black holes are described by a small number of parameters. Apart from the mass of the black hole ($M$), among the most interesting characteristics is the spin ($a$), which determines the degree of rotation, i.e., the angular momentum of the black hole. The latter is observationally constrained by the spectral and timing properties of the radiation signal emerging from an accretion disk of matter orbiting near the event horizon. In the case of planar (standard, equatorial) accretion disk, it is the location of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) that determines the observable radiation characteristics, and this way allows us to measure the spin. In this paper, we discuss a more general case of the Innermost Stable Spherical Orbits (ISSO) extending above and below the equatorial plane. To this end, we study the non-equatorial geodesic motion of particles following inclined, spherical, relativistically precessing trajectories with the aim of exploring the boundary between the regions of stable (energetically bound) and escaping (energetically unbound) motion. The concept of the ISSO radius should play a role in determining the inner rim of a tilted or geometrically thick accretion flow. We demonstrate that the region of inclined bound orbits has a complicated structure due to enhanced precession near the inner rim. We also explore the fate of particles launched below the radius of the Marginally Bound Spherical Orbit (MBSO): these may either plunge into the event horizon or escape to radial infinity.</description>

      <title>The particle acceleration study in blazar jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle acceleration of blazar jets is crucial to high-energy astrophysics, yet the acceleration mechanism division in blazar subclasses and the underlying nature of these mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, we utilized the synchrotron spectral information (synchrotron peak frequency, $\log \nu_{\rm sy}$, and corresponding curvature, $b_{\rm sy}$) of 2705 blazars from the literature and studied the subject of particle acceleration in blazar jets by analysing the correlation between $\log \nu_{\rm sy}$ and $1/b_{\rm sy}$. Our results suggested that the entire sample follows an energy-dependent probability acceleration (EDPA). Specifically, the low inverse Compton peak sources (LCPs) follow the mechanism that fluctuations of fractional gain acceleration (FFGA), while the high inverse Compton peak sources (HCPs) follow an acceleration mechanism of EDPA. Our results indicated that the separation between LCPs and HCPs results from the electron peak Lorentz factor ($\gamma_{\rm p}$), and the differentiation should originate from different acceleration mechanisms. Moreover, our study revealed a transition in the acceleration mechanism from FFGA to EDPA around $\log \nu_{\rm sy} \sim 15$ through a detailed analysis of binned-$\log \nu_{\rm sy}$. The mechanism of FFGA dominates the particle acceleration in LCP jets because of stronger jets and the EDPA dominates the particle energy gain in the HCPs due to a more efficient acceleration process.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Radio Emissions from Accretion Disk Winds in Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the origins of radio emissions from radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGNs) remains a pivotal challenge in astrophysics. One potential source of this radiation is the shock interaction between AGN disk winds and the interstellar medium (ISM). To understand this phenomenon, we construct a spherical, one-zone, and self-similar expansion model of shock structure between ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and the ISM. We then calculate the energy density distribution of non-thermal electrons by solving the transport equation, considering diffusive shock acceleration as the acceleration mechanism and synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling as the cooling mechanisms. Based on the derived energy distribution of non-thermal electrons, we model the radio synchrotron spectrum of shocked ISM. For the 15 nearby RQ AGNs hosting UFOs, we investigate shocked ISM parameters required to model their observed radio spectra, based on X-ray observations and measured UFO velocities. Radio spectra of 11 out of 15 nearby RQ AGNs would be explained by the AGN disk wind model. This is a compelling indication that shock interactions between AGN disk winds and the ISM could indeed be the source of their radio emissions. The typical predicted source size and magnetic field strength are several $100$ pc and $0.1$ mG, respectively. We also discuss whether our prediction can be tested by future radio observations.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of Type Ia Supernova Spectra into the Near-Infrared Using PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method of extrapolating the spectroscopic behavior of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength regime up to 2.30 $\mu$m using optical spectroscopy. Such a process is useful for accurately estimating K-corrections and other photometric quantities of SNe Ia in the NIR. Principal component analysis is performed on data consisting of Carnegie Supernova Project I &amp; II optical and near-infrared FIRE spectra to produce models capable of making these extrapolations. This method differs from previous spectral template methods by not parameterizing models strictly by photometric light-curve properties of SNe Ia, allowing for more flexibility of the resulting extrapolated NIR flux. A difference of around -3.1% to -2.7% in the total integrated NIR flux between these extrapolations and the observations is seen here for most test cases including Branch core-normal and shallow-silicon subtypes. However, larger deviations from the observation are found for other tests, likely due to the limited high-velocity and broad-line SNe Ia in the training sample. Maximum-light principal components are shown to allow for spectroscopic predictions of the color-stretch light-curve parameter, $s_{BV}$, within approximately $\pm$0.1 units of the value measured with photometry. We also show these results compare well with NIR templates, although in most cases the templates are marginally more fitting to observations, illustrating a need for more concurrent optical+NIR spectroscopic observations to truly understand the diversity of SNe Ia in the NIR.</description>

      <title>Thermal X-ray Emission in the Western Half of the LMC Superbubble 30 Dor C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While 30 Dor C is a unique superbubble in the Large Magellanic Cloud for its luminous non-thermal X-ray emission, the thermal X-ray emission it emanates has not yet been thoroughly investigated and well constrained. Based on the separate ~1 Ms deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we report the discovery of the thermally-emitting plasma in some portions of the western half of 30 Dor C. The thermal emission can be reproduced by a collisional-ionization-equilibrium plasma model with an average electron temperature of ~0.4 keV. We find a significant overabundance of the intermediate-mass elements such as O, Ne, Mg, and Si, which may be indicative of a recent supernova explosion in 30 Dor C. Dynamical properties in combination with the information of the OB association LH 90 suggest that the internal post-main-sequence stars dominate the power of the superbubble and blow it out in the past ~1 Myr.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion-Like Particles Dark Matter in Coma Berenices with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) appear in many extensions of the Standard Model and are being investigated as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. One viable methodology for their detection involves the investigation of the line-like radio emissions from the dwarf spheroidal galaxy, potentially originating from the radiative decay of ALPs or the conversion of ALPs in the magnetic field. In this work, we constrain the properties of ALPs using the 2-hour radio observation of Coma Berenices through the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The $\rm 95\%$ upper limits of the ALP-photon coupling are calculated for the ALP decay and conversion scenarios, respectively. Note that the sensitive ALP masses for FAST range from $\sim \mu \rm eV$ to tens of $\mu \rm eV$, where ALP can explain the DM abundance naturally. However, our limits are weaker than those of the CAST helioscope, which can provide an independent and complementary check on the ALP non-detection for ground experiments. Furthermore, we evaluate the expected sensitivity on the ALP of FAST with its full designed bandwidth (70 $\rm MHz$ - 3 $\rm GHz$) for 100 hours of observation time. Our results indicate that, even with the exceptional sensitivity of the FAST, it is challenging to surpass the existing experimental constraints on ALP DM using radio observation of dSphs, unless the possible enhancements of ALP signals by compact stars in dSphs are considered.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray confinement in radio bubbles by micromirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio bubbles, ubiquitous features of the intracluster medium around active galactic nuclei, are known to rise buoyantly for multiple scale heights through the intracluster medium (ICM). It is an open question how the bubbles can retain their high-energy cosmic-ray content over such distances. We propose that the enhanced scattering of cosmic rays due to micromirrors generated in the ICM, as proposed recently by Reichherzer et al. (2023), is a viable mechanism for confining the cosmic rays within bubbles and can qualitatively reproduce their morphology. We discuss the observational implications of such a model of cosmic-ray confinement.</description>

      <title>Searching for Magnetar Binaries Disrupted by Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) are considered to be the primary magnetar formation channel, with 15 magnetars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). A large fraction of these should occur in massive stellar binaries that are disrupted by the explosion, meaning that $\sim45\%$ of magnetars should be nearby high-velocity stars. Here we conduct a multi-wavelength search for unbound stars, magnetar binaries, and SNR shells using public optical ($uvgrizy-$bands), infrared ($J-$, $H-$, $K-$, and $K_s-$bands), and radio ($888$ MHz, $1.4$ GHz, and $3$ GHz) catalogs. We use Monte Carlo analyses of candidates to estimate the probability of association with a given magnetar based on their proximity, distance, proper motion, and magnitude. In addition to recovering a proposed magnetar binary, a proposed unbound binary, and 13 of 15 magnetar SNRs, we identify two new candidate unbound systems: an OB star from the Gaia catalog we associate with SGR J1822.3-1606, and an X-ray pulsar we associate with 3XMM J185246.6+003317. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation that assumes all magnetars descend from CCSNe, we constrain the fraction of magnetars with unbound companions to $5\lesssim f_u \lesssim 24\%$, which disagrees with population synthesis results. Alternate formation channels are unlikely to wholly account for the lack of unbound binaries as this would require $31\lesssim f_{nc} \lesssim 66\%$ of magnetars to descend from such channels. Our results support a high fraction ($48\lesssim f_m \lesssim 86\%$) of pre-CCSN mergers, which can amplify fossil magnetic fields to preferentially form magnetars.</description>

      <title>A Monte-Carlo Simulation on Resonant Scattering of X-ray Line Emission in Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant scattering (RS) of X-ray line emission in supernova remnants (SNRs) may modify the observed line profiles and fluxes and has potential impact on estimating the physical properties of the hot gas and hence on understanding the SNR physics, but has not been theoretically modeled ever. Here we present our Monte-Carlo simulation of RS effect on X-ray resonant-line emission, typified by O VII He$\alpha$ r line, from SNRs. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov-Taylor solution and some basic parameters similar to those in Cygnus Loop. We show that the impact of RS effect is most significant near the edge of the remnant. The line profiles are predicted to be asymmetric because of different temperatures and photon production efficiencies of the expanding gas at different radii. We also predict the surface brightness of the line emission would decrease in the outer projected region but is slightly enhanced in the inner. The G-ratio of the OVII He$\alpha$ triplet can be effectively elevated by RS in the outer region. We show that RS effect of the O VII He$\alpha$ r line in the southwestern boundary region of Cygnus Loop is non-negligible. The observed OVII G-ratio $\sim$1.8 of the region could be achieved with RS taken into account for properly elevated O abundance from the previous estimates. Additional simulation performed for the SNRs in ejecta-dominated phase like Cas A shows that RS in the shocked ejecta may have some apparently effects on the observational properties of oxygen resonant lines.</description>

      <title>Search for Neutrino Emission from GRB 221009A using the KM3NeT ARCA and ORCA detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. The recent GRB 221009A event, identified as the brightest gamma-ray burst ever detected, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hadronic emissions involving neutrinos. The KM3NeT undersea neutrino detectors participated in the worldwide follow-up effort triggered by the event, searching for neutrino events. In this letter, we summarize subsequent searches, in a wide energy range from MeV up to a few PeVs. No neutrino events are found in any of the searches performed. Upper limits on the neutrino emission associated with GRB 221009A are computed.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Search of Gravitational Waves: Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the small strain amplitudes of gravitational-wave (GW) signals, unveiling them in the presence of detector/environmental noise is challenging. For visualizing the signals and extracting its waveform for a comparison with theoretical prediction, a frequency-domain whitening process is commonly adopted for filtering the data. In this work, we propose an alternative template-free framework based on autoregressive modeling for denoising the GW data and extracting the waveform. We have tested our framework on extracting the injected signals from the simulated data as well as a series of known compact binary coalescence (CBC) events from the LIGO data. Comparing with the conventional whitening procedure, our methodology generally yields improved cross-correlation and reduced root mean square errors with respect to the signal model.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the dense matter equation of state from young and cold isolated neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars are the dense and highly magnetic relics of supernova explosions of massive stars. The quest to constrain the Equation of State (EoS) of ultra-dense matter and thereby probe the behavior of matter inside neutron stars, is one of the core goals of modern physics and astrophysics. A promising method involves investigating the long-term cooling of neutron stars, and comparing theoretical predictions with various sources at different ages. However, limited observational data, and uncertainties in source ages and distances, have hindered this approach. In this work, re-analyzing XMM-Newton and Chandra data from dozens of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars, we have identified three sources with unexpectedly cold surface temperatures for their young ages. To investigate these anomalies, we conducted magneto-thermal simulations across diverse mass and magnetic fields, considering three different EoS. We found that the "minimal" cooling model, failed to explain the observations, regardless the mass and the magnetic field, as validated by a machine learning classification method. The existence of these young cold neutron stars suggests that any dense matter EoS must be compatible with a fast cooling process at least in certain mass ranges, eliminating a significant portion of current EoS options according to recent meta-modelling analysis.</description>

      <title>A new solution of the pulsar equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first new type of solution of the pulsar equation since 1999. In it, the whole magnetosphere is confined inside the light cylinder and an electrically charged layer wraps around it and holds it together. The reason this new solution has never been obtained before is that all current time-dependent simulations are initialized with a vacuum dipole configuration that extends to infinity, thus their final steady-state solution also extends to infinity. Under special conditions, such a confined configuration may be attained when the neutron star first forms in the interior of a collapsing star during a supernova explosion, or when it accretes from an external wind or disk from a donor star. It is shown that this new maximally closed non-decelerating solution is the limit of a continuous sequence of standard magnetospheres with open and closed field lines when the amount of open field lines gradually drops to zero. The minimum energy solution in this sequence is a standard magnetosphere in which the closed field line region extends up to about 80% of the light cylinder. We estimate that the released energy when the new solution transitions to the minimum energy one is enough to power a fast radio burst.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength pulse profiles from the force-free neutron star magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute a full atlas of radio, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray pulse profiles relying on the force-free magnetosphere model. Our goal is to use such data bank of multi-wavelength profiles to fit a substantial number of radio-loud $\gamma$-ray pulsars also detected in non-thermal X-rays to decipher the X-ray radiation mechanism and sites. Using results from the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC), we investigate the statistical properties of this population. We assume that radio emission emanates from field lines rooted to the polar caps, at varying height above the surface, close to the surface, at an altitude about 5-10% of the light-cylinder radius $r_{\rm L}$. The X-ray photons are produced in the separatrix region within the magnetosphere, i.e. the current sheet formed by the jump from closed to open magnetic field lines. We allow for substantial variations in emission height. The $\gamma$-ray are produced within the current sheet of the striped wind, outside the light-cylinder. A comprehensive set of light-curves in radio, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray has been computed. Based on only geometric considerations about magnetic obliquity, line of sight inclination and radio beam cone opening angle, pulsars can be classified as radio-loud or quiet and $\gamma$-ray loud or quiet. We found that the 3PC sample is compatible with an isotropic distribution of obliquity and line of sight. The atlases constructed in this work are the fundamental tools to explore individual pulsars and fit their multi-wavelength pulse profiles in order to constrain their magnetic topology, the emission sites as well as the observer line of sight.</description>

      <title>The neutrino background from non-jetted active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We calculate the contribution to the neutrino background from the non-jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) population following the recent IceCube association of TeV neutrinos with NGC 1068. Methods. We exploit our robust knowledge of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and evolution and convert it to the neutrino band by using NGC 1068 as a benchmark and a theoretically motivated neutrino spectrum. Results. The resulting neutrino background up to redshift 5 does not violate either the IceCube diffuse flux or the upper bounds for non-jetted AGN, although barely so. This is consistent with a scenario where the latter class makes a substantial contribution mostly below 1 PeV, while jetted AGN, i.e. blazars, dominate above this energy, in intriguing agreement with the dip in the neutrino data at ~ 300 TeV. More and better IceCube data on Seyfert galaxies will allow us to constrain the fraction of neutrino emitters among non-jetted AGN.</description>

      <title>LHAASO-KM2A detector simulation using Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KM2A is one of the main sub-arrays of LHAASO, working on gamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray physics at energies above 10 TeV. Detector simulation is the important foundation for estimating detector performance and data analysis. It is a big challenge to simulate the KM2A detector in the framework of Geant4 due to the need to track numerous photons from a large number of detector units (&gt;6000) with large altitude difference (30 m) and huge coverage (1.3 km^2). In this paper, the design of the KM2A simulation code G4KM2A based on Geant4 is introduced. The process of G4KM2A is optimized mainly in memory consumption to avoid memory overffow. Some simpliffcations are used to signiffcantly speed up the execution of G4KM2A. The running time is reduced by at least 30 times compared to full detector simulation. The particle distributions and the core/angle resolution comparison between simulation and experimental data of the full KM2A array are also presented, which show good agreement.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Low-Mass Gap Black Hole Echoing LVK Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary merger involving a potential low-mass gap black hole (LMBH) by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration motivates investigations into mechanisms beyond conventional stellar evolution theories to account for their existence. We study a mechanism in which dark matter (DM), through its capture and accumulation inside main sequence stars, induces the formation of black holes within the mass range of $[3, 5]M_\odot$. We examine the distribution of these LMBHs as a function of galaxy halo mass, particularly when paired with neutron stars. This gives a distinct signature that can be tested with future gravitational wave observations. We find that a viable portion of the DM parameter space predicts a merger rate of such binaries consistent with LVK observations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>Dark matter phenomenology and phase transition dynamics of the next to minimal composite Higgs model with dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the Next-to-Minimal Composite Higgs Model (NMCHM) extended with a dilaton field $\chi$ (denoted as NMCHM$_\chi$). A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) $\eta$, resulting from the SO(6)$\to$SO(5) breaking, serves as a dark matter (DM) candidate. The inclusion of the dilaton field is helpful for evading the stringent constraints from dark matter direct detection, as it allows for an accidental cancellation between the amplitudes of DM-nucleon scattering, an outcome of the mixing between the dilaton and Higgs fields. The presence of the dilaton field also enriches the phase transition patterns in the early universe. We identify two types of phase transitions: (i) a 1-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) occur simultaneously, and (ii) a 2-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry breaking transition takes place first, followed by a second phase transition corresponding to EWSB. Since the first-order phase transitions can be strong due to supercooling in our model, we also examine the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by these phase transitions. We find that these gravitational waves hold promise for detection in future space-based gravitational wave experiments, such as LISA, Taiji, BBO, and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>eDIG-CHANGES II: Project Design and Initial Results on NGC 3556</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents ionized gases traced by optical/UV lines beyond the stellar extent of galaxies. We herein introduce a novel multi-slit narrow-band spectroscopy method to conduct spatially resolved spectroscopy of the eDIG around a sample of nearby edge-on disk galaxies (eDIG-CHANGES). In this paper, we introduce the project design and major scientific goals, as well as a pilot study of NGC 3556 (M108). The eDIG is detected to a vertical extent of a few kpc above the disk, comparable to the X-ray and radio images. We do not see significant vertical variation of the [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio. A rough examination of the pressure balance between different circum-galactic medium (CGM) phases indicates the magnetic field is in a rough pressure balance with the X-ray emitting hot gas, and may play an important role in the global motion of both the eDIG and the hot gas in the lower halo. At the location of an HST/COS observed UV bright background AGN $\sim29\rm~kpc$ from the center of NGC 3556, the magnetic pressure is much lower than that of the hot gas and the ionized gas traced by UV absorption lines, although the extrapolation of the pressure profiles may cause some biases in this comparison. By comparing the position-velocity diagrams of the optical and CO lines, we also find the dynamics of the two gas phases are consistent with each other, with no evidence of a global inflow/outflow and a maximum rotation velocity of $\sim150\rm~km~s^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian Processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (PTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of the first-order PT. I find that peak structure of the sound speed is stable against inclusion of PTs. Furthermore, while the current data cannot differentiate between a crossover and a first-order PT, it suggests an exceedingly low probability of the absence of either within the stable branch of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Saturation of the Bell Instability using Hybrid Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonresonant streaming instability (Bell instability) plays a pivotal role in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays (CRs); yet, the exact mechanism responsible for its saturation and the magnitude of the final amplified magnetic field have not been assessed from first-principles. Using a survey of hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study the evolution of the Bell instability as a function of the parameters of the CR population. We find that, at saturation, the magnetic pressure in the amplified field is comparable with the initial CR anisotropic pressure, rather than with the CR energy flux as previously argued. These results provide a predictive prescription for the total magnetic field amplification expected in the many astrophysical environments where the Bell instability is important.</description>

Abstract: Here we consider the results of direct measurements of muons in extensive air showers with zenith angles $\theta \le 45^{\circ}$ and energy above $10^{17}$ eV, obtained at the Pierre Auger Observatory and Yakutsk array. In both experiments muons were registered with underground scintillation detectors with $\approx 1.0 \times \sec\theta$ GeV energy threshold. Measured density values were compared to theoretical predictions calculated within the framework of the QGSJet-II.04 hadron interaction model. They differ by factor $1.53 \pm 0.13$(stat). We demonstrate that this difference is due to overestimation of muon densities by 1.22 times and underestimation of primary energy by 1.25 times in the Auger experiment.</description>

      <title>A systematic analysis of the X-ray emission in optically selected tidal disruption events: observational evidence for the unification of the optically and X-ray selected populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray emission of a sample of 17 optically selected, X-ray-detected tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered between 2014 and 2021. The X-ray light curves show a diverse range of temporal behaviors, with most sources not following the expected power-law decline. The X-ray spectra are mostly extremely soft and consistent with thermal emission from the innermost region of an accretion disk, which cools as the accretion rate decreases. Three sources show formation of a hard X-ray corona, at late-times. The spectral energy distribution shape, probed by the ratio ($L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}$) between the UV/optical and X-ray, shows a wide range $L_{\rm BB}/L_{\rm X}\,\in\,(0.5,\,3000)$ at early-times, and converges to disk-like values $L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}\,\in\,(0.5,\,10)$ at late-times. We estimate the fraction of optically discovered TDEs with $L_{\rm\,X}\,\geq 10^{42}~\rm{erg}~\rm{s}^{-1} $ to be at least $40\%$, and show that X-ray loudness is independent of black hole mass. We argue that distinct disk formation time scales are unlikely to fully explain the diverse range of X-ray evolutions. We combine our sample with X-ray discovered ones to construct an X-ray luminosity function, best fitted by a broken power-law, with a break at $L_{\rm\,X} \approx 10^{44}~\rm{erg}~\rm{s}^{-1} $. We show that there is no dichotomy between optically and X-ray selected TDEs, instead there is a continuum of early time $L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}$, at least as wide as $L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}\,\in\,(0.1,\,3000)$, with optical/X-ray surveys selecting preferentially, but not exclusively, from the higher/lower end of the distribution. Our findings are consistent with unification models for the overall TDE population.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Emission of PSR B1937+21 at 327 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At 327 MHz, the observed emission of PSR B1937+21 is greatly affected by scattering in the interstellar medium, on a timescale of order the pulse period. We use the bright impulsive giant pulses emitted by the pulsar to measure the impulse response of the interstellar medium and then recover the intrinsic emission of the pulsar by deconvolution -- revealing fine structure on timescales not normally observable. We find that the intrinsic widths of the main pulse and interpulse in the pulse profile are similar to those measured at higher frequencies. We detect 60,270 giant pulses which typically appear as narrow, ~100 ns bursts consisting of one to few nanoshots with widths $\lesssim \! 10$ ns. However, about 10% of the giant pulses exhibit multiple bursts which seem to be causally related to each other. We also report the first detection of giant micropulses in PSR B1937+21, primarily associated with the regular main pulse emission. These are distinct from giant pulses not only in the phases at which they occur, but also in their larger widths, of order a microsecond, and steeper energy distribution. These measurements place useful observational constraints on emission mechanisms for giant pulses as well as the regular radio emission of millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Simple numerical X-ray polarization models of reflecting axially symmetric structures around accreting compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15647v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a series of numerical models suitable for X-ray polarimetry of accreting systems. Firstly, we provide a spectropolarimetric routine that integrates reflection from inner optically thick walls of a geometrical torus of arbitrary size viewed under general inclination. In the studied example, the equatorial torus is illuminated by a central isotropic source of X-ray power-law emission, representing a hot corona. Nearly neutral reprocessing inside the walls is precomputed by Monte Carlo code STOKES that incorporates both line and continuum processes, including multiple scatterings and absorption. We created a new XSPEC model, called xsstokes, which in this version enables efficient X-ray polarimetric fitting of the torus parameters, observer's inclination and primary emission properties, interpolating for arbitrary state of primary polarization. Comparison of the results to a Monte Carlo simulation allowing partial transparency shows that the no-transparency condition may induce different polarization by tens of %. Allowing partial transparency leads to lower/higher polarization fraction, if the resulting polarization orientation is perpendicular/parallel to the rotation axis. We provide another version of xsstokes that is suitable for approximating nearly neutral reflection from a distant optically thick disc of small geometrical thickness. It assumes local illumination averaged for a selected range of incident angles, representing a toy model of a diffuse corona of various physical extent. Assessing both xsstokes variants, we conclude that the resulting polarization can be tens of % and perpendicularly/parallelly oriented towards the rotation axis, if the reflecting medium is rather vertically/equatorially distributed with respect to a compact central source.</description>

      <title>Electron and proton energization in 3D reconnecting current sheets in semirelativistic plasma with guide magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 3D particle-in-cell simulation, we characterize energy conversion, as a function of guide magnetic field, in a thin current sheet in semirelativistic plasma, with relativistic electrons and subrelativistic protons. There, magnetic reconnection, the drift-kink instability (DKI), and the flux-rope kink instability all compete and interact in their nonlinear stages to convert magnetic energy to plasma energy. We compare fully 3D simulations with 2D in two different planes to isolate reconnection and DKI effects. In zero guide field, these processes yield distinct energy conversion signatures: ions gain more energy than electrons in 2Dxy (reconnection), while the opposite is true in 2Dyz (DKI), and the 3D result falls in between. The flux-rope instability, which occurs only in 3D, allows more magnetic energy to be released than in 2D, but the rate of energy conversion in 3D tends to be lower. Increasing the guide magnetic field strongly suppresses DKI, and in all cases slows and reduces the overall amount of energy conversion; it also favors electron energization through a process by which energy is first stored in the motional electric field of flux ropes before energizing particles. Understanding the evolution of the energy partition thus provides insight into the role of various plasma processes, and is important for modeling radiation from astrophysical sources such as accreting black holes and their jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the recent statistics of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently -- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.</description>

      <title>Towards more accurate synthetic reflection spectra: improving the calculations of returning radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new model to calculate reflection spectra of thin accretion disks in Kerr spacetimes. Our model includes the effect of returning radiation, which is the radiation that is emitted by the disk and returns to the disk because of the strong light bending near a black hole. The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of RELXILL (modified to read the table of REFLIONX, which is the non-relativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that RELXILL with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk's ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated. We can find better fits and recover the correct input parameters as the value of the black hole spin parameter decreases and the value of the coronal height increases.</description>

      <title>Constraining the hadronic properties of star-forming galaxies above $1\, \rm GeV$ with 15-years Fermi-LAT data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star-forming and starburst galaxies (SFGs and SBGs) are considered to be powerful emitters of non-thermal gamma-rays and neutrinos. On this regard, the Fermi-LAT collaboration has found a correlation between the gamma-ray and infrared luminosities for a sample of local sources. Yet, the physics behind these non-thermal emissions is still under debate. Using the publicly-available fermitools, we analyse 15.3 years of gamma-ray between 1-1000 GeV data for 70 sources, 56 of which were not previously detected. We relate this emission to a physically-motivated model for SBGs in order to constrain Fcal for each source and then study its correlation with the star formation rate of the sources. We find at 4sigma level an indication of gamma-ray emission for other two SBGs, namely M 83 and NGC 1365. By contrast, we find that, with the new description of background, the significance for the gamma-ray emission of the previously detected M 33 reduces at $4\sigma$. We also find that the physically-motivated model for Fcal correctly describes the $\gamma$-ray observations, and it is crucial to assess the systematic uncertainty on the star formation rate. Finally, undiscovered sources strongly constraints Fcal at 95\% CL, providing fundamental information when we interpret the results as common properties of SFGs and SBGs. Hence, we find that these sources might contribute 12% to the EGB, while the corresponding diffuse neutrino flux strongly depends on the spectral index distribution along the source class.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking due to multi-angle matter-neutrino resonance in neutron star merger remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star merger remnants are unique sites for exploring neutrino flavor conversion in dense media. Because of the natural excess of $\bar{\nu}_e$ over $\nu_e$, the neutrino-neutrino potential can cancel the matter potential, giving rise to matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion. Under the assumption of two (anti)neutrino flavors and spatial homogeneity, we solve the neutrino quantum kinetic equations to investigate the occurrence of the matter-neutrino resonance within a multi-angle framework. We find that isotropy is broken spontaneously, regardless of the mass ordering. Relying on a hydrodynamical simulation of a binary neutron star merger remnant with a black hole of $3\ M_\odot$ and an accretion torus of $0.3\ M_\odot$, we find that complete flavor conversion caused by the matter-neutrino resonance is unlikely, although the matter and neutrino potentials cancel at various locations above the disk. Importantly, the matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion crucially depends on the shape of the neutrino angular distributions. Our findings suggest that an accurate modeling of the neutrino angular distributions is necessary to understand flavor conversion physics in merger remnants, its implications on the disk physics and synthesis of the elements heavier than iron.</description>

      <title>Solving the Teukolsky equation with physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to compute the first quasi-normal modes of the Kerr geometry via the Teukolsky equation. This technique allows us to extract the complex frequencies and separation constants of the equation without the need for sophisticated numerical techniques, and with an almost immediate implementation under the \texttt{PyTorch} framework. We are able to compute the oscillation frequencies and damping times for arbitrary black hole spins and masses, with accuracy typically below the percentual level as compared to the accepted values in the literature. We find that PINN-computed quasi-normal modes are indistinguishable from those obtained through existing methods at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) larger than 100, making the former reliable for gravitational-wave data analysis in the mid term, before the arrival of third-generation detectors like LISA or the Einstein Telescope, where SNRs of ${\cal O}(1000)$ might be achieved.</description>

      <title>A full reconstruction of two galaxy clusters intra-cluster medium with strong gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whilst X-rays and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations allow to study the properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, their gravitational potential may be constrained using strong gravitational lensing. Although being physically related, these two components are often described with different physical models. Here, we present a unified technique to derive the ICM properties from strong lensing for clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to derive this model, we present a new universal and self-similar polytropic temperature profile, which we fit using the X-COP sample of clusters. We subsequently derive an analytical model for the electron density, which we apply to strong lensing clusters MACS J0242.5-2132 and MACS J0949.8+1708. We confront the inferred ICM reconstructions to XMM-Newton and ACT observations. We contrast our analytical electron density reconstructions with the best canonical $\beta$-model. The ICM reconstructions obtained prove to be compatible with observations. However they appear to be very sensitive to various dark matter halo parameters constrained through strong lensing (such as the core radius), and to the halo scale radius (fixed in the lensing optimisations). With respect to the important baryonic effects, we make the sensitivity on the scale radius of the reconstruction an asset, and use the inferred potential to constrain the dark matter density profile using ICM observations. The technique here developed should allow to take a new, and more holistic path to constrain the content of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Implications of comprehensive nuclear and astrophysics data on the equations of state of neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of state (EoSs) governing neutron star (NS) matter obtained for both non-relativistic and relativistic mean-field models are systematically confronted with a diverse set of terrestrial data and astrophysical observations within the Bayesian framework. The terrestrial data, spans from bulk properties of finite nuclei to the heavy-ion collisions, constrain the symmetric nuclear matter EoS and the symmetry energy up to twice the saturation density ($\rho_0$= 0.16 fm$^{-3}$). The astrophysical observations encompass the NS radius, the tidal deformability, and the lower bound on maximum mass. Three distinct posterior distributions of EoSs are generated by gradually updating the priors with different constraints: (i) only the maximum NS mass, (ii) incorporating additional terrestrial data, (iii) combining both the terrestrial data and astrophysical observations. These EoS distributions are then compared using the Kullback-Liebler divergence which highlights the significant constraints imposed on the EoSs by the currently available lower bound of NS maximum mass and terrestrial data. The remaining astrophysical observations marginally refine the EoS within the density range $\sim$ 2-3$\rho_0$. It is observed that the relativistic mean field model yields stiffer EoS around the saturation density, but predict smaller values of the speed of sound and proton fraction in the interior of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Expansion of accreting main-sequence stars during rapid mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting main-sequence stars expand significantly when the mass accretion timescale is much shorter than their thermal timescales. This occurs during mass transfer from an evolved giant star onto a main-sequence companion in a binary system, and is an important phase in the formation of compact binaries including X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, and gravitational-wave sources. In this study, we compute 1D stellar models of main-sequence accretors with different initial masses and accretion rates. The calculations are used to derive semi-analytical approximations to the maximum expansion radius. We assume that mass transfer remains fully conservative as long as the inflated accretor fits within its Roche lobe, leading stars to behave like hamsters, stuffing excess material behind their expanding cheeks. We suggest a physically motivated prescription for the mass growth of such "hamstars", which can be used to determine mass-transfer efficiency in rapid binary population synthesis models. With this prescription, we estimate that progenitors of high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational-wave sources may have experienced highly non-conservative mass transfer. In contrast, for low-mass accretors, the accretion timescale can exceed the thermal timescale by a larger factor without causing significant radial expansion.</description>

      <title>Accurate analytical modeling of light rays in spherically symmetric spacetimes: Applications in the study of black hole accretion disks and polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new, simple analytical formulas to accurately describe light rays in spherically symmetric static spacetimes. These formulas extend those introduced by Beloborodov and refined by Poutanen for the Schwarzschild metric. Our enhanced formulas are designed to be applicable to a broader range of spacetimes, making them particularly valuable for describing phenomena around compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. As an illustration of their application, we present analytical studies of images of thin accretion disks surrounding black holes and explore their associated polarimetry.</description>
