      <title>Revisiting FastMap: New Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FastMap was first introduced in the Data Mining community for generating Euclidean embeddings of complex objects. In this dissertation, we first present FastMap to generate Euclidean embeddings of graphs in near-linear time: The pairwise Euclidean distances approximate a desired graph-based distance function on the vertices. We then apply the graph version of FastMap to efficiently solve various graph-theoretic problems of significant interest in AI: including facility location, top-K centrality computations, community detection and block modeling, and graph convex hull computations. We also present a novel learning framework, called FastMapSVM, by combining FastMap and Support Vector Machines. We then apply FastMapSVM to predict the satisfiability of Constraint Satisfaction Problems and to classify seismograms in Earthquake Science.</description>

      <title>The Power of Amortization on Scheduling with Explorable Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a scheduling problem with explorable uncertainty. Each job comes with an upper limit of its processing time, which could be potentially reduced by testing the job, which also takes time. The objective is to schedule all jobs on a single machine with a minimum total completion time. The challenge lies in deciding which jobs to test and the order of testing/processing jobs.
  The online problem was first introduced with unit testing time and later generalized to variable testing times. For this general setting, the upper bounds of the competitive ratio are shown to be $4$ and $3.3794$ for deterministic and randomized online algorithms; while the lower bounds for unit testing time stands, which are $1.8546$ (deterministic) and $1.6257$ (randomized).
  We continue the study on variable testing times setting. We first enhance the analysis framework and improve the competitive ratio of the deterministic algorithm from $4$ to $1+\sqrt{2} \approx 2.4143$. Using the new analysis framework, we propose a new deterministic algorithm that further improves the competitive ratio to $2.316513$. The new framework also enables us to develop a randomized algorithm improving the expected competitive ratio from $3.3794$ to $2.152271$.</description>

      <title>Quasilinearization with Regularizing Tensor Paraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the Bony quasilinearization formula as a tensor paraproduct decomposition to obtain an approximation, $\tilde{A}(f)$, to $A(f)$ where $f \in \text{tensor-} \Lambda^{\alpha}([0,1]^2)$ and $A \in C^2$. The rough content of $A(f)$ is encoded in the approximation of $\tilde{A}(f)$ while the residual, $\Delta(A,f) = A(f) - \tilde{A}(f)$, which is of regularity $\text{tensor-} \Lambda^{2 \alpha}([0,1]^2)$, contains the smooth content of $A(f)$.</description>

      <title>Continuous optimization methods for the graph isomorphism problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graph isomorphism problem looks deceptively simple, but although polynomial-time algorithms exist for certain types of graphs such as planar graphs and graphs with bounded degree or eigenvalue multiplicity, its complexity class is still unknown. Information about potential isomorphisms between two graphs is contained in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their adjacency matrices. However, symmetries of graphs often lead to repeated eigenvalues so that associated eigenvectors are determined only up to basis rotations, which complicates graph isomorphism testing. We consider orthogonal and doubly stochastic relaxations of the graph isomorphism problem, analyze the geometric properties of the resulting solution spaces, and show that their complexity increases significantly if repeated eigenvalues exist. By restricting the search space to suitable subspaces, we derive an efficient Frank-Wolfe based continuous optimization approach for detecting isomorphisms. We illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm with the aid of various highly symmetric graphs.</description>

      <title>New Results on Periodic Golay Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms by providing the first ever examples of periodic Golay pairs of length $v = 90$. The smallest length for which the existence of periodic Golay pairs is undecided is now $106$.</description>

      <title>Two-person Positive Shortest Path Games Have Nash Equilibria in Pure Stationary Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every finite two-person shortest path game, where the local cost of every move is positive for each player, has a Nash equilibrium (NE) in pure stationary strategies, which can be computed in polynomial time. We also extend the existence result to infinite graphs with finite out-degrees. Moreover, our proof gives that a terminal NE (in which the play is a path from the initial position to a terminal) exists provided at least one of the two players can guarantee reaching a terminal. If none of the players can do it, in other words, if each of the two players has a strategy that separates all terminals from the initial position $s$, then, obviously, a cyclic NE exists, although its cost is infinite for both players, since we restrict ourselves to positive games. We conjecture that a terminal NE exists too, provided there exists a directed path from $s$ to a terminal. However, this is open.
  We extend our result to short paths interdiction games, where at each vertex, we allow one player to block some of the arcs and the other player to choose one of the non-blocked arcs. Assuming that blocking sets are chosen from an independence system given by an oracle, we give an algorithm for computing a NE in time $O(|E|(\log|V|+\tau))$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of arcs, and $\tau$ is the maximum time taken by the oracle on any input.</description>

      <title>Problems in NP can Admit Double-Exponential Lower Bounds when Parameterized by Treewidth or Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08149v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treewidth (tw) is an important parameter that, when bounded, yields tractability for many problems. For example, graph problems expressible in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic and QUANTIFIED SAT or, more generally, QUANTIFIED CSP, are FPT parameterized by the tw of the input's (primal) graph plus the length of the MSO-formula [Courcelle, Information &amp; Computation 1990] and the quantifier rank [Chen, ECAI 2004], resp. The algorithms from these (meta-)results have running times whose dependence on tw is a tower of exponents. A conditional lower bound by Fichte et al. [LICS 2020] shows that, for QUANTIFIED SAT, the height of this tower is equal to the number of quantifier alternations. Lower bounds showing that at least double-exponential factors in the running time are necessary are rare: there are very few (for tw and vertex cover vc parameterizations) and they are for problems that are complete for #NP, $\Sigma_2^p$, $\Pi_2^p$, or higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
  We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to go higher up in the polynomial hierarchy to obtain such lower bounds. We design a novel, yet simple versatile technique based on Sperner families to obtain such lower bounds and apply it to 3 problems: METRIC DIMENSION, STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, and GEODETIC SET. We prove that they do not admit $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms, even on bounded diameter graphs, unless the ETH fails. For STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, the lower bound holds even for vc. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds.</description>

      <title>On a Generalization of Wasserstein Distance and the Beckmann Problem to Connection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of optimal parallel transport between vector fields on a connection graph, which consists of a weighted graph along with a map from its edges to an orthogonal group. Inspired by the well-known equivalence of 1-Wasserstein distance and minimum cost flows on standard graphs, we consider two versions of this problem: a minimum norm vector-valued flow problem with divergence constraints reflective of the connection structure of the graph; and a modified version which incorporates both quadratic regularization and a relaxation of the divergence constraint. Our theoretical contributions include: conditions for feasibility and computation of the Lagrangian dual problem for both problems, and duality correspondence for the relaxed-regularized version. Example applications of the model including transport between color images, vector field interpolation, and unsupervised clustering of vector field-valued data (in this case hurricane trajectory data) are also considered.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Chordal Circular-arc Graphs: I. Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most elusive problem around the class of circular-arc graphs is identifying all minimal graphs that are not in this class. The main obstacle is the lack of a systematic way of enumerating these minimal graphs. McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a transformation from circular-arc graphs to interval graphs with certain patterns of representations. We fully characterize these interval patterns for circular-arc graphs that are split graphs, thereby building a connection between minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs and minimal non-interval graphs. This connection enables us to identify all minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. As a byproduct, we develop a linear-time certifying recognition algorithm for circular-arc graphs when the input is a split graph.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set Parameterized by Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a resolving set of $G$ if, for any two vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, there exists a vertex $w\in S$ such that $d(w,u)\neq d(w,v)$. The Metric Dimension problem takes as input a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and a positive integer $k$, and asks whether there exists a resolving set of size at most $k$. In another metric-based graph problem, Geodetic Set, the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and the objective is to determine whether there exists a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that, for any vertex $u \in V(G)$, there are two vertices $s_1, s_2 \in S$ such that $u$ lies on a shortest path from $s_1$ to $s_2$.
  These two classical problems turn out to be intractable with respect to the natural parameter, i.e., the solution size, as well as most structural parameters, including the feedback vertex set number and pathwidth. Some of the very few existing tractable results state that they are both FPT with respect to the vertex cover number $vc$.
  More precisely, we observe that both problems admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and a kernelization algorithm that outputs a kernel with $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc)}$ vertices. We prove that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set, even on graphs of bounded diameter, neither admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{o(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(vc)}$ vertices. The versatility of our technique enables us to apply it to both these problems.
  We only know of one other problem in the literature that admits such a tight lower bound. Similarly, the list of known problems with exponential lower bounds on the number of vertices in kernelized instances is very short.</description>

      <title>A survey of Zarankiewicz problems in geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function $ex(n,H)$, which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with $n$ vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph $H$ as a subgraph. Tur{\'a}n provided a complete characterization for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $r$ vertices. Erd{\H o}s, Stone, and Simonovits extended Tur{\'a}n's result to arbitrary graphs $H$ with $\chi(H) &gt; 2$ (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of $ex(n, H)$ for bipartite graphs $H$ remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz's problem, which asks for the asymptotics of $ex(n, K_{t,t})$.
  In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz's problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz's problem in geometrically defined graphs.</description>

      <title>Largest component in Boolean sublattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a subfamily ${F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ of the Boolean lattice, consider the graph $G_{F}$ on ${F}$ based on the pairwise inclusion relations among its members. Given a positive integer $t$, how large can ${F}$ be before $G_{F}$ must contain some component of order greater than $t$? For $t=1$, this question was answered exactly almost a century ago by Sperner: the size of a middle layer of the Boolean lattice. For $t=2^n$, this question is trivial. We are interested in what happens between these two extremes. For $t=2^{g}$ with $g=g(n)$ being any integer function that satisfies $g(n)=o(n/\log n)$ as $n\to\infty$, we give an asymptotically sharp answer to the above question: not much larger than the size of a middle layer. This constitutes a nontrivial generalisation of Sperner's theorem. We do so by a reduction to a Tur\'an-type problem for rainbow cycles in properly edge-coloured graphs. Among other results, we also give a sharp answer to the question, how large can ${F}$ be before $G_{F}$ must be connected?</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of (d,r)-Domination via Modular Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has significant negative effects on the decision-making of individuals, organizations and communities within society. Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, through an awareness process, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named \textsc{$(d,r)$-Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to standard and structural parameters. We give fixed-parameter algorithms as well as polynomial compressions/kernelizations for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>
