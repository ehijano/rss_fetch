      <title>Hydrodynamic modulation via cupping in a crustacean-inspired propulsor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shrimp, like many invertebrates swimming at intermediate Reynolds numbers ($Re$), rely on the interplay between morphology and kinematics to generate thrust while producing sufficient lift to overcome their negative buoyancy. Shrimp pleopods branch into an endopodite and an exopodite, whose relative motion varies the projected surface area during the swimming cycle. For this mechanism to function, the exopodite must be cambered relative to the endopodite at a set cupping angle $\zeta$, which partially decouples the effective angle of attack of the exopodite from the overall leg kinematics. Here, we investigate the role of $\zeta$ in modulating thrust$-$lift balance during steady forward locomotion. Using a dynamically scaled (40$\times$) robotic pleopod, we systematically varied $\zeta$ from $0^\circ$ to $80^\circ$, measured hydrodynamic forces, and performed particle image velocimetry at $Re = 968$. Moderate cupping angles ($\zeta = 20^\circ-40^\circ$), consistent with biological observations, provide optimal thrust$-$lift balance. At these angles, the exopodite abducts rapidly during the power stroke, maximizing projected area at peak flow velocity, and adducts early during the return stroke, minimizing resistive drag. A reduced-order force model reveals that the exopodite contributes 52$-$62\% of total lift, particularly at intermediate $\zeta$, where a leading-edge vortex (LEV) forms and remains attached throughout the power stroke. At extreme cupping angles, LEV coherence degrades and force production weakens. These findings demonstrate that shrimp pleopods function as hybrid propulsors exploiting both drag- and lift-based forces, and that $\zeta$ serves as a geometric control parameter capable of tuning thrust$-$lift balance independently of stroke kinematics.</description>

      <title>Improvement of reduced-order model for two-dimensional cylinder flow based on global proper orthogonal decomposition in terms of robustness and computational speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) are widely used in fluid engineering to enable rapid prediction of flow fields for parametric analysis, design optimization, and control applications. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is commonly employed to construct ROMs because it provides an optimal basis for representing a given flow dataset. However, POD-based ROMs often lack robustness when applied to flow conditions that differ from those included in the training data. Incorporating multiple flow conditions can improve robustness, but this generally increases the computational cost of ROM prediction, which limits practical applicability in engineering workflows. In this study, we propose a ROM framework that achieves fast and robust flow prediction even when the dataset contains a large number of flow conditions. The proposed approach employs a novel two-step order-reduction strategy based on POD. In the second reduction step, flow conditions that are most relevant to the target prediction are selectively retained, thereby reducing the computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the proposed ROM is evaluated for a two-dimensional unsteady flow past a circular cylinder, a canonical benchmark problem in fluid engineering. The model accurately reproduces the relationship between vortex-shedding frequency and Reynolds number obtained from full numerical simulations. Furthermore, the proposed ROM reduces the computational cost by approximately 50% compared with a conventional POD-based ROM constructed using flow data at 27 different Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Mathematical Analysis and Physical Implications of the Principle of Minimum Pressure Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a two-way equivalence between the incompressible Navier- Stokes equation (INSE) and the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). We prove that a candidate smooth flow field is a solution of the INSE if and only if its instantaneous evolution minimizes, at every instant, the norm of the pressure force, required to enforce incompressibility. We show that the PMPG is precisely the minimization formulation of the Leray-Helmholtz projection. Any admissible instantaneous evolution (e.g., onset of separation) resulting from the INSE necessarily minimizes the PMPG cost. Conversely, any other kinematically admissible evolution, requiring a strictly larger pressure force to ensure the same constraints, does not satisfy the INSE. Thus, the PMPG offers a variational perspective through which intricate incompressible flow behaviors may be interpreted.
  In a finite-dimensional setting with divergence-free modes, we show that the PMPG yields the same dynamics as classical Galerkin projection. Moreover, the PMPG provides a natural generalization of classical Galerkin projection beyond linear modal expansions, accommodating nonlinear and non-modal representations. We then examine the relation between instantaneous dynamical minimization and steady variational selection, including its connection to the variational theory of lift. Motivated by these observations, we formulate conjectures concerning necessary conditions for stability and the convergence of Navier-Stokes solutions to Euler's in the vanishing-viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Advection-modulated gaseous diffusion through an orifice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine flow and transport through an orifice in a flat wall separating semi-infinite atmospheres of two dissimilar gases. The analysis assumes steady conditions and order-unity values of the Schmidt number Sc and P\'eclet number Pe, such that advection and diffusion contribute comparably to mass and momentum transport. Mixing between the two gases induces order-unity variations in viscosity and density, resulting in coupled concentration and velocity fields. The solution yields the mass transfer rates of both gases, expressed in terms of an appropriately defined Sherwood number, as well as the overpressure required to sustain the flow, all as functions of Sc and Pe. An explicit analytical solution is obtained in the limit of small Pe, while numerical integration is used to describe flows with Pe = O(1). The mixing of hydrogen and air is used as an illustrative example that serves to highlight the influence of large gas-molecular-weight differences on the flow structure and associated mixing rate, with additional selected results given for the case of hydrogen and water vapor.</description>

      <title>Quasi-geostrophic Rayleigh-B\'enard convection on the tilted $f$-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection on a $f$-plane at colatitude $\vartheta_f$ is investigated numerically using an asymptotically reduced equation set valid in the limit of very rapid rotation. The equations provide a non-hydrostatic but quasi-geostrophic description in a non-orthogonal coordinate system. The tilt changes the structure of the large-scale barotropic condensate from large-scale vortices to zonal flows as the colatitude of the $f$-plane increases, with bistable states present for certain parameter ranges, extending prior work to a geophysically significant parameter regime. This behaviour is understood through the impact of broken rotation symmetry on the barotropic source terms resulting from baroclinic vortical stresses and baroclinic torque. As the tilt angle $\vartheta_f$ increases, global heat and momentum transport is reduced relative to upright-polar convection, a result that is explained through linear theory and nonlinear power maps both of which demonstrate increased attenuation of the domain of dynamically active spatial scales as the convective modes depart from a North-South alignment in the horizontal plane. A key finding is that the predominance of lateral thermal mixing allows for the maintenance of a persistent unstable mean temperature gradient that saturates at increasing forcing levels and remains insensitive to the colatitude.</description>

      <title>Pressure beneath a periodic travelling water-wave in constant-vorticity flow over a flat bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate within the framework of linear theory the behaviour of the total (hydrodynamic) pressure and of the dynamic pressure in a regular wave train which propagates at the surface of water with a flat bed in a flow with constant vorticity. We show that nonzero vorticity, the hallmark of a non-uniform underlying current, may strongly alter the behaviour with respect to the case of irrotational flows, for which the maximum and minimum of the dynamic pressure always occur at the wave crest and at the wave trough, respectively (the extrema of the dynamic pressure may occur along the flat bed or along the critical level, depending on the vorticity strength). While vorticity does not modify the increase of the hydrodynamic pressure with depth, it can significantly alter the location of the extrema of the hydrodynamic pressure at a fixed depth level.</description>

      <title>A Novel Explicit Filter for the Approximate Deconvolution in Large-Eddy Simulation on General Unstructured Grids: A posteriori tests on highly stretched grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit filters play a pivotal role in the scale separation and numerical stability of advanced Large Eddy Simulation (LES) closures, such as dynamic eddy-viscosity or Approximate Deconvolution (AD) methods. In the present study, it is demonstrated that the performance of commonly used explicit filters applicable to general unstructured grids highly depends on the grid configuration, specifically the cell aspect ratio, which can result in poor filter spectral properties, ultimately leading to large errors and even solution divergence. This study introduces a novel, efficient explicit filter for general unstructured grids, addressing this shortcoming through a combination of a face-averaging technique and recursive filtering. The filter parameters are then determined through a constrained multi-objective optimization, ensuring desirable spectral properties, including high-wavenumber attenuation, filter-width precision, filter stability and positivity, and minimized dispersion and commutation errors. The AD-LES of turbulent channel flow benchmarks using the new filter demonstrate a noticeable improvement in turbulent flow predictions on highly stretched boundary-layer-type grids, particularly in reducing the log-layer mean velocity profile mismatch, compared to simulations using conventional filters. The analyses show that this enhancement is mainly attributed to the sufficient level of attenuation near the Nyquist wavenumber achieved by the new filter in all spatial directions across various grid configurations, among others. The new filter was also successfully tested on unstructured prism grids for the 3D Taylor-Green vortex benchmark.</description>

      <title>Phase dynamics and their role determining energy flux in hydrodynamic shell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transfer of energy and other conserved quantities across scales, also known as flux or spectral flux, is a central aspect of out-of-equilibrium systems such as turbulent hydrodynamic flows. Despite its role in the few predictive theories that exist, a dynamical understanding of what determines said flux (and its direction in scale) has yet to be established. In this study, we work towards this understanding by investigating how the dynamics of complex Fourier velocity phases influence the flux of conserved quantities in hydrodynamic shell models. The phase dynamics, like energy evolution, are influenced by contributions from all neighboring triads, making the full problem intractable. Instead, we assume that the dynamics of the triad phases are determined solely by the so-called self-interaction term and treat the other neighboring triad terms as noise. This transforms the phase dynamics into that of a noisy phase oscillator, which we solve analytically to predict phase statistics. We validate this assumption with a suite of shell model simulations. Our results give us analytical predictions for the energy flux, when the energy spectrum is given. We prove that all shell models that conserve energy along with a sign-indefinite quadratic quantity (this includes three-dimensional turbulence analogues) undergo a forward energy cascade, and further show that the phase dynamics prevent the shell model analogue of two-dimensional turbulence from forming an inverse cascade of energy.</description>

      <title>Sequential water wave reconstruction in VOF-based numerical wave tanks with the EnKF approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing phase-resolved wave reconstruction methods are mostly based on potential flow theory, which limits their ability to capture strongly nonlinear phenomena such as wave breaking dynamics. In such cases, the importance of multiphase incompressible Navier--Stokes solvers becomes particularly evident. These solvers form the foundation of the widely used numerical wave tanks in marine, ocean, and coastal engineering. However, the high dimensionality of the state variables in such systems often hinders the efficiency of data assimilation. The POD method is applied to reduce the order of the state vector in ensemble-based data assimilation, where instantaneous snapshots are naturally available. Given the unsteady nature and random phase combinations of irregular waves, the effectiveness of single data assimilation is limited. Sequential data assimilation is thus adopted to continuously update the wave profile as it evolves, ensuring that the wave field matches the real-world conditions. Therefore, inflation is needed to mitigate the ensemble collapse. Unlike single-phase flows without any interface, where the background error covariance can be inflated directly, to preserve physical constraints, when inflating for the phase field, the velocity field is simultaneously updated by incorporating potential flow formulas. Three representative cases-regular waves, irregular waves, and plunging waves-are used to validate the proposed method and assess its performance. The effect of assimilation parameters is also examined. The results demonstrate that the sequential data assimilation strategy achieves accurate free-surface reconstruction for a VOF-based numerical wave tank.</description>

      <title>cfdmfFTFoam: A front-tracking solver for multiphase flows on general unstructured grids in OpenFOAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Front-Tracking Method (FTM) is a promising approach for numerical solution of multiphase flows, considering a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. The existing open-source open-access software for FTM is scarce, due to complexity of the coding and algorithms, and is limited to structured Cartesian grids or connectivity-free front mesh hybrid FTMs. To provide a pure FTM solver on general unstructured grids, the Ftc3D FTM code has been integrated into the OpenFOAM CFD software by implementing necessary front mesh to Eulerian grid communication and front nodes advection algorithms, applicable to unstructured grids and for both serial and parallel runs. The new FTM package, called cfdmfFTFoam, has been further equipped with a variety of FTM sub-algorithms, including the front volume correction, remeshing, surface tension computation, indicator function construction, etc. Assessments and validations of the new solver are provided against several standard multiphase flow benchmarks. It is anticipated that cfdmfFTFoam would facilitate future research on and algorithm improvement in the field of FTM.</description>

      <title>Causally coherent structures in turbulent dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraction of spatio-temporal coherence in high-dimensional, chaotic, non-linear dynamical systems, such as turbulent flows, remains a fundamental challenge in physics, mathematics and engineering. In this work, we employ Shannon transfer entropy (TE) to identify causally coherent motions in a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL). This causality metric, rooted in information theory, enables the identification of sources and targets in dynamical systems using the corresponding time series. However, TE requires sophisticated tuning of various hyperparameters, such as the Markovian order of the source ($m$), which can spatially vary in wall-bounded turbulent flow. Here, we present an adaptive tuning and discuss the influence of $m$ across different TBLs. We introduce the concept of causally coherent structures (CCS), i.e. coherent structures interpreted as spatio-temporal patterns of causality. Moreover, the net transfer entropy flux is also utilised to identify boundary layer locations acting either as sources or targets. The standard viscous, logarithmic, and outer layers are characterised by information fluxes, highlighting, for example, dominant top-down interactions between the inner and outer layers, analogously to the classical energy cascade. This work extends techniques previously employed in the literature, such as correlation and spectral analysis, and presents an approach that is inherently general and applicable to a wide range of chaotic dynamical systems, with applications in cognitive sciences, systems biology and finance.</description>

      <title>On Topology of Perturbed Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-helicity vortices, such as Hill's vortex and field-reversed configurations (FRCs), have long been assumed to be toroidal in topology. This paper proves this assumption false: even under arbitrarily small odd-parity (with respect to the z-axis of symmetry) perturbations, flux surfaces in the interior region become simply connected in topology with crescent-shaped boundaries. A new inner separatrix emerges, separating toroidal flux surfaces in an intermediate region from simply connected surfaces in the core. In a spherical vortex with perturbations at roughly 10% of the background field strength, the simply connected region occupies ~40% of the total closed-field-line volume. The analysis rigorously proves the conjecture regarding field-line closure under odd-parity perturbations in a full three-dimensional context, completing previous partial proofs in two-dimensional geometry. Preliminary numerical simulations of charged particle trajectories in field-reversed configurations revealed crescent-shaped drift surfaces even for small gyroradii. Given that FRCs are sustained by rotating magnetic fields with odd parity, these results motivate a revision of FRC-related fusion confinement physics. Furthermore, given the mathematical equivalence to Hill's vortex, this updates our topological understanding of fluid flow in a wide array of phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct examples and provide a classification of self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations whose pseudo-velocity fields possess more than one stagnation point. These solutions are also homogeneous steady states of the Euler equations. In contrast, we prove that any homogeneous self-similar solution with bounded vorticity away from the origin necessarily admits only a single stagnation point, located at the origin. The solutions we construct develop velocity cusps along rays from the origin, and this allows for additional stagnation points of the pseudo-velocity field.</description>
