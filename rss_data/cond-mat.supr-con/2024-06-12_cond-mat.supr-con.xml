      <title>Inverse melting and re-entrant transformations of the vortex lattice in amorphous Re6Zr thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting of a solid is one of the most ubiquitous phenomena observed in nature. Most solids, when heated, melt from a crystalline state to an isotropic liquid at a characteristic temperature. There are however situations where increase in temperature can induce a transition to a more ordered state. Broadly termed as "inverse melting", experimental realisations of such situations are rare. Here, we report such a phenomenon in the 2-dimensional vortex liquid that forms in a moderately pinned amorphous Re6Zr (a-ReZr) thin film, from direct imaging of the vortex lattice using a scanning tunnelling microscope. At low temperature and magnetic fields, we find that the vortices form a "pinned liquid" , that is characterised by a low mobility of the vortices and vortex density that is spatially inhomogeneous. As the temperature or magnetic field is increased the vortices become more ordered, eventually forming a nearly perfectly ordered vortex lattice. Above this temperature/magnetic field, the ordered vortex lattice melts again into a vortex liquid. This re-entrant transformation from a liquid to solid-like state and then back to a liquid also leaves distinct signature in the magnetotransport properties of the superconductor.</description>

      <title>Structures and Superconductivity of Hydrogen and Hydrides under Extreme Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic hydrogen, existing in remarkably extreme environments, was predicted to exhibit long-sought room-temperature superconductivity. Although the superconductivity of metallic hydrogen has not been confirmed experimentally, superconductivity of hydrogen in hydrides was recently discovered with remarkably high critical temperature as theoretically predicted. In recent years, theoretical simulations have become a new paradigm for material science, especially exploration of material at extreme pressure. As the typical high-pressure material, metallic hydrogen has been providing a fertile playground for advanced simulations for long time. Simulations not only provide the substitute of experiments for hydrogen at high-pressure, but also encouraged the discovery of almost all the experimentally discovered superconducting hydrides with the record high superconducting transition temperature. This work reviews recent progress in hydrogen and hydrides under extreme pressure, focusing on phase diagram, structures and the long-sought goal of high-temperature superconductivity. In the end, we highlight structural features of hydrides for realization of hydrogen-driven superconducting hydrides near ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Evidence of surface $p$-wave superconductivity and higher-order topology in MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration of nontrivial superconductivity and electronic band topology is at the core of condensed matter physics and applications to quantum information. The transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoTe$_2$ has been proposed as an ideal candidate to explore the interplay between topology and superconductivity, but their studies remain limited because of the high-pressure environments required to control the topological phase transition. In this work, we demonstrate the tunable superconductivity and the resultant higher-order topology of MoTe$_2$ under extreme pressure. In the pressured T$_d$ phase, Andreev reflection spectroscopy reveals two-gap features, indicating that the Weyl fermions lead to a topological $s^{\pm}$-wave multigap superconductivity. On the other hand, the high-pressure 1T$'$ phase presents $p$-wave surface superconductivity emergent from the second-order topological bands via the bulk-to-surface proximity effect. Our analysis suggests that the topological hinge states generated from second-order topological bands evolve into zero-energy Majorana hinge states in the second-order topological superconductor. These results demonstrate the potential realization of topological superconductivity in MoTe$_2$, thus opening a pathway for studying various topological natures of TMDC materials.</description>

      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials can exhibit electronic topological features yet are inherently quasiperiodic. Nonetheless, the localizing tendency of quasiperiodicity can be prevented by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Charge response function probed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering: the signature of electronic gaps of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In strongly correlated systems the complete determination of the dynamical susceptibility $\chi(\textbf{q}, \omega)$ is of special relevance because of the entwinement of the spin and charge components. Although Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) spectra are directly related to both the charge ($\chi''_c(\textbf{q}, \omega)$) and the spin ($\chi''_s(\textbf{q}, \omega)$) contributions, only the latter has been extensively studied with RIXS so far. Here we show how to extract from RIXS spectra of high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates relevant properties of $\chi''_c$, such as the presence of the superconducting gap and of the pseudogap. In particular, we exploit the temperature dependence of the Cu L$_3$ edge RIXS spectra of underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ at specific wave-vectors q. The signature of the two gaps is in the departure of the low energy Bosonic excitation continuum from the statistical temperature-dependence. This approach can be immediately used to investigate systematically the nature of the pseudogap in cuprates, thereby taking advantage of the RIXS technique that does not suffer the limitations of surface-sensitive electron spectroscopies. Its extension to other interesting materials is foreseen.</description>

      <title>Multiband Metallic Ground State in Multilayered Nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Probed by $^{139}$La-NMR at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a $^{139}$La-NMR study of polycrystalline samples of multi($n$)-layered nickelates, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ ($n=2$) and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ ($n=3$), at ambient pressure. Measurements of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and nuclear spin relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) indicate the emergence of a density wave order with a gap below $T^*\sim150$ K for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and $\sim130$ K for La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$. The finite value of $1/T_1$ below $T^*$ indicates metallic ground states with the remaining density of states at the Fermi level ($E_{\rm F}$) under the density wave order. These features are attributed to multiple $d$ electron bands with different characteristics. Above $T^*$, the gradual decrease in $1/T_1T$ upon cooling implies the presence of a band with flat dispersion near $E_{\rm F}$. From our microscopic probes, we point out that these nickelates ($n=2$ and $3$) possess similar electronic states despite the difference in the formal valence of the Ni-$d$ electron states, which provides a basis for understanding the novel high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity under high pressures.</description>

      <title>Charge-4$e$ Superconductivity in a Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A phase of matter in which fermion quartets form a superconducting condensate, rather than the paradigmatic Cooper pairs, is a recurrent subject of experimental and theoretical studies. However, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of charge-4$e$ superconductivity as a quantum phase is lacking. Here, we propose and study a two-orbital tight-binding model with attractive Hubbard-type interactions. Such a model naturally provides the Bose-Einstein condensate as a limit for electron quartets and supports charge-4$e$ superconductivity, as we show by mapping it to a spin-1/2 chain in this perturbative limit. Using both exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations for the one-dimensional case, we further establish that the ground state is indeed a superfluid phase of 4$e$ charge carriers and that this phase can be stabilized well beyond the perturbative regime. Importantly, we demonstrate that 4$e$ condensation dominates over 2$e$ condensation even for nearly decoupled orbitals, a scenario suitable for experiments with ultracold atoms in the form of almost decoupled chains. Our model paves the way for both experimental and theoretical exploration of 4$e$ superconductivity and provides a natural starting point for future studies beyond one dimension or more intricate 4$e$ states.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and magnetic correlations in trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that under pressure trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (LNO) becomes superconducting below a critical temperature $\sim$20 K, in addition to the infinite-layer and bilayer systems. Motivated by this observation, we explore the effects of electron correlations on its electronic structure and magnetic properties using the advanced DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach. Our results for the normal-state electronic structure and correlation effects in LNO have much in common with the infinite-layer and bilayer nickelates, with a remarkable site- and orbital-dependent renormalizations of the Ni $3d$ bands and notable incoherence of the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states, caused by correlation effects. Our analysis of the Fermi surface and magnetic correlations suggests the emergence of competing spin and charge stripe states, implying the importance of in-plane spin fluctuations to explain superconductivity in this material.</description>
