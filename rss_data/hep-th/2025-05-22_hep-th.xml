      <title>$G_2$-manifolds from Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that \emph{perturbatively flat vacua} (PFVs) introduced in \cite{Demirtas:2019sip} are dual to M-theory compactifications on $G_2$-manifolds, enabling the enumeration of novel $G_2$-manifolds via solutions to Diophantine equations in type IIB flux quanta. Independently, we show that warping corrections to the effective action of type IIB flux vacua grow parametrically at large complex structure, and we demonstrate that these corrections can nonetheless be captured by a classical geometric computation in M-theory.</description>

      <title>Cobordism Utopia: U-Dualities, Bordisms, and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric supergravity theories lead to celebrated non-perturbative constraints on the structure of quantum gravity. They can also lead to the presence of global symmetries since manifolds equipped with non-trivial duality bundles can carry topological charges captured by non-trivial elements of bordism groups. The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture thus predicts the existence of new singular objects absent in the low-energy supergravity theory, which break these global symmetries.
  We investigate this expectation in two directions, involving the different choices of U-duality groups $G_U$, as well as $k$, the dimension of the closed manifold carrying the topological charge. First, we compute for all supergravity theories in dimension $3 \leq D \leq 11$ the bordism groups $\Omega_1^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$. Second, we treat in detail the case of $D = 8$, computing all relevant bordism groups $\Omega_k^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$ for $1 \leq k \leq 7$. In all cases, we identify corresponding string, M-, or F-theory backgrounds which implement the required U-duality defects. In particular, we find that in some cases there is no purely geometric background available which implements the required symmetry-breaking defect. This includes non-geometric twists as well as non-geometric strings and instantons.
  This computation involves several novel computations of the bordism groups for $G_U = \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$, which localizes at primes $p=2,3$. Whereas an amalgamated product structure greatly simplifies the calculation of purely $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ bundles, this does not extend to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$. Rather, we leverage the appearance of product / ring structures induced from cyclic subgroups of $G_U$ which naturally act on the relevant bordism groups.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Complement of a Gravitating Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any gravitating region $a$ in any spacetime gives rise to a generalized entanglement wedge, the hologram $e(a)$. Holograms exhibit properties expected of fundamental operator algebras, such as strong subadditivity, nesting, and no-cloning. But the entanglement wedge EW of an AdS boundary region $B$ with commutant $\bar B$ satisfies an additional condition, complementarity: EW$(B)$ is the spacelike complement of EW$(\bar B)$ in the bulk.
  Here we identify an analogue of the boundary commutant $\bar B$ in general spacetimes: given a gravitating region $a$, its \emph{fundamental complement} $\tilde{a}$ is the smallest wedge that contains all infinite world lines contained in the spacelike complement $a'$ of $a$. We refine the definition of $e(a)$ by requiring that it be spacelike to $\tilde a$. We prove that $e(a)$ is the spacelike complement of $e(\tilde a)$ when the latter is computed in $a'$.
  We exhibit many examples of $\tilde{a}$ and of $e(a)$ in de Sitter, flat, and cosmological spacetimes. We find that a Big Bang cosmology (spatially closed or not) is trivially reconstructible: the whole universe is the entanglement wedge of any wedge inside it. But de Sitter space is not trivially reconstructible, despite being closed. We recover the AdS/CFT prescription by proving that EW$(B)=e($causal wedge of $B$).</description>

      <title>Observers seeing gravitational Hilbert spaces: abstract sources for an abstract path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral suggests a striking result: the Hilbert space of closed universes in each superselection sector, a so-called $\alpha$-sector, is one-dimensional. We develop an abstract formalism encapsulating recent proposals that modify the gravitational path integral in the presence of observers and allow larger Hilbert spaces to be associated with closed universes. Our formalism regards the gravitational path integral as a map from abstract objects called sources to complex numbers, and introduces additional objects called partial sources, which form sources when glued together. We apply this formalism to treat, on equal footing, universes with spatial boundaries, closed universes with prescribed observer worldlines, and closed universes containing observers entangled with external systems. In these contexts, the relevant gravitational Hilbert spaces contain states prepared by partial sources and can consequently have nontrivial $\alpha$-sectors supporting noncommuting operators. Within our general framework, the positivity of the gravitational inner product implies a bound on the Hilbert space trace of certain positive operators over each $\alpha$-sector. The trace of such operators, in turn, quantifies the effective size of this Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Calabi-Yau Black Holes and Non-Perturbative D0-brane Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the supersymmetric entropy of the most general BPS black hole in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity coupled to $n_V$ vector multiplets obtained from Type IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold at large volume, including the all-genera leading-order $\alpha'$-corrections. These can be equivalently seen as D0-brane quantum effects from a dual five-dimensional M-theory perspective. We find that these corrections generically lead to both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the black hole entropy. We argue that the exception occurs for certain specific configurations where the gauge background, seen through the lens of D0-brane probes, behaves as purely electric or purely magnetic, thereby accounting for the absence of such non-perturbative effects. To explore this further, we perform a semiclassical analysis of the (non-)BPS particle dynamics in the near-horizon geometry of the underlying black hole, which is described by a maximally supersymmetric AdS$_2\times \mathbf{S}^2$ solution. As a byproduct, this study provides additional insights into the (non-perturbative) stability of supersymmetric black hole solutions and suggests an interpretation in terms of complex saddles contributing to the worldline path integral.</description>

      <title>The Hydrodynamic Approach to Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several papers from the mid to late 1990s suggest that Einstein's equations should be thought of as the hydrodynamic equations of a special class of quantum systems. A classical solution defines subsystems by dividing space-time up into CAUSAL DIAMONDS and Einstein's equations are the hydrodynamics of a system that assigns a density matrix to each diamond whose modular Hamiltonian K has expectation value and fluctuation both given by A/4G. A is the maximal d-2 volume on the boundary of the diamond and G is Newton's constant. These properties define the EMPTY DIAMOND STATE, the analog of the quantum field theory (QFT) vacuum, in the background geometry. The assignment of density matrices to each diamond enables one to define the analog of half sided modular flow along geodesics in the background manifold, as a unitary embedding of the Hilbert space of a given diamond into the next one in a nesting with Planck scale time steps. We conjecture that this can be enhanced to a full set of compatible unitary evolutions on a Hilbert bundle of the space of time-like geodesics, using a QUANTUM PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE defined in the text. The compatibility of this formalism with the experimental success of QFT is discussed, as well as the theoretical mechanism by which QFT emerges from this version of quantum gravity. This is a slightly expanded version of an essay that won Honorable Mention in the Gravitation Research Essay Contest for 2025.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of a Scalar Field in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a free massive scalar field at its ground state in (3+1)-dimensional AdS space in global coordinates. We consider spherical entangling surfaces centered at the origin of AdS. We determine the structure of the UV-divergent terms in the entanglement entropy and compute the numerical values of the respective coefficients. We confirm the connection between the coefficient of the logarithmic term and the conformal anomaly.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of tetrad gravity: Unlike diffeomorphisms, all shifts are integrable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved notion of internal tetrad shifts in 4 dimensions which is always integrable in the presence of corners. This allows us to study the fully extended corner symmetry algebra of gauge charges, which is a deformation of $ISO(1,3)^S$ involving spacetime curvature. We argue this implies corner noncommutativity of the spin connection $\omega$. The latter in particular hints that an extended BF theory might be a better way understand the dynamics of tetrad gravity. This result presents us with an integrable, complete set of edge modes for gravity in 4D, with potential ramifications for asymptotic symmetries and quantisation.</description>

      <title>A Match Made in Heaven: Linking Observables in Inflationary Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions of inflaton and graviton perturbations are the fundamental observables of early universe cosmology and remain a primary target for observations. In this work, we ask the following question: are these observables independent of one another? We find that in the parity-odd sector of inflationary perturbation theory, the answer is a resounding no! In earlier work we derived a correlator-to-correlator factorisation formula which states that parity-odd correlators factorise into lower-point correlators under some mild assumptions on the underlying theory. In this work, we show that these assumptions are satisfied in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity where the action of minimal inflation is augmented by a coupling between the inflaton and the gravitational Chern-Simons term. Such a theory gives rise to a parity-odd trispectrum of curvature perturbations, and we show that such a trispectrum can be expressed solely in terms of the bispectrum that arises due to the minimal coupling between the inflaton and graviton, and the graviton power spectrum which receives a parity-odd correction in this theory. The trispectrum is quadratic in this mixed inflaton-graviton bispectrum and can therefore be interpreted as a ``double copy". Our final expression for the parity-odd trispectrum is a relatively simple function of the external momenta that is rational and factorised.</description>

      <title>Shape-invariant Potentials and Singular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two exact classical solutions in two-dimensional singular spaces. These solutions are lower-dimensional versions of some five-dimensional brane world solutions. Unlike the higher-dimensional model, our solutions have exactly solvable linear perturbation equations, namely, Schr\"odinger-like equations with P\"oschl-Teller I potential and Eckart potential. Both potentials are shape-invariant and can be solved exactly using supersymmetric quantum mechanics methods. In our work, the P\"oschl-Teller I potential has infinitely many bound states, while the Eckart potential captures a finite number of bound states. Both potentials are positive-definite which indicates that the background solutions are stable against linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning the 6d Supergravity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the study of the string landscape and swampland in 6-dimensions. Our data are the (almost) anomaly-free 6-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ supergravity models, characterised by the Gram matrix of anomaly coefficients. Our work demonstrates the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently learn highly complex features of the landscape and swampland. Employing an autoencoder for unsupervised learning, we provide an auto-classification of these models by compressing the Gram matrix data to 2-dimensions. Through compression, similar models cluster together, and we identify prominent features of these clusters. The autoencoder also identifies outlier models which are difficult to reconstruct. One of these outliers proves to be incredibly difficult to combine with other models such that the $\text{tr}R^{4}$ anomaly vanishes, making its presence in the landscape extremely rare. Further, we utilise supervised learning to build two classifiers predicting (1) model consistency under probe string insertion (precision: 0.78, predicting consistency for 214,837 models with reasonable certainty) and (2) inconsistency under anomaly inflow (precision: 0.91, predicting inconsistency for 1,909,359 models). Notably, projecting these predictions onto the autoencoder's 2-dimensional latent layer shows consistent models clustering together, further indicating that the autoencoder has learnt interesting and complex features of the set of models and potentially offers a novel approach to mapping the landscape and swampland of 6-dimensional supergravity theories.</description>

      <title>Light Black Holes from Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alvarez-Dominguez, Garay, Martin-Martinez, and Polo-Gomez have suggested that ``it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon. We argue that the dissipative quantum effects coming from the self-interaction of light (such as vacuum polarization) are enough to prevent any meaningful buildup of energy that could create a black hole in any realistic scenario,'' and ``the dissipation of energy via Schwinger effect alone is enough to prevent the formation of kugelblitze with radii ranging from $10^{-29}$ to $10^8$ m.'' While I agree that it is indeed highly implausible that black holes will form mainly from light in our actual universe, either naturally or by any foreseeable human activity, there are many idealized theoretical processes for forming black holes of any size down to near the Planck length (about $10^{-35}$ m) purely from photons, such as from colliding approximately plane-wave pulses, with only a small fraction of the energy escaping the black hole as scattered light or electron-positron pairs.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative effects in JT gravity from KdV equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the partition function of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity is obtained by an integral transformation of volumes of moduli spaces for Riemann surfaces, also known as the Weil-Petersson volumes. This fact enables us to compute the perturbative genus expansion of the partition function by solving a KdV-type non-linear partial differential equation. In this work, we find that this KdV equation also admits transseries solutions. We give a systematic algorithm to explicitly construct a one-parameter transseries solution to the KdV equation. Our approach is based on general two-dimensional topological gravity, and the results for the JT gravity are easily obtained as a special case. The results in the leading non-perturbative sector perfectly agree with another independent calculation from topological recursions in random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum field theory in Klein space that has two time directions. To study the canonical quantization, we select the ``length of time" $q$ as the evolution direction of the system. In our novel construction, some additional modes beyond the plane wave modes are crucial in the canonical quantization and the later derivation of the LSZ reduction formula. We also derive the free two-point function by using Wick contraction in the canonical quantization formalism. Moreover, we introduce the path-integral formalism in which we can redefine the vacuum states and rederive the correlation functions. We show that all the results in the Klein space derived in our novel approach match those obtained via analytical continuation from the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Twisted Partition Functions as Order Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum field theories with global symmetry, we can study the behavior of the partition function with the background gauge field to diagnose different quantum phases. For the case of discrete symmetries, we find that the symmetry-twisted partition function works as an order parameter that discriminates spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states. We then consider its application to the case of 4d Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matters to understand the relation between the twisted partition function and the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. We also study its behavior for the spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry and interpret the result from the viewpoint of the mixed anomaly with the emergent solitonic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Macdonald deformation of Vogel's universality and link hyperpolynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vogel's universality implies a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. Actually this is true (if at all) only for a piece of representation theory captured by knot/Chern-Simons theory, where some irreducible representations are often undistinguishable and combined into new ``universally-irreducible" entities (uirreps). We consider from this point of view the recently discovered Macdonald deformation of quantum dimensions, for which a kind of universality holds for the ADE series. The claim is that universal are not Macdonald dimensions themselves, but their products with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, which themselves are functions of $q$ and $t$ in Macdonald theory. These products are precisely what arises in knot/refined Chern-Simons theory. Actually, we consider the simplest decomposition of adjoint square into six uirreps and obtain the universal formulas for hyperpolynomials of the Hopf link and, more generally, of the torus links $T[2,2n]$.</description>

      <title>Standard Running, "Physical Running" and Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it is asserted that the standard beta function does not describe the correct running of the coupling constant in some theories. We show that the problem arises from the assumption $\mu=p$ ($\mu$ is a renormalization point) and that a suitable choice of $\mu$ gives the correct running. It is also claimed that neither the cosmological constant nor Newton constant run. We argue that running can be discussed when we consider the curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constructive approach to solution of the conservation condition for conformal higher spin tree-point correlation function with equal spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new constructive approach to the solutions of the conservation condition for the three-point conformal correlation function in the Osborn-Petkou formulation generalized by the authors for higher spins. We propose for correlation functions of the same spin conformal currents the general hypothesis that the Osborn-Petkou structural tensor of higher spins satisfying the right symmetry conditions can be obtained from the combination of the principal terms of spin one and two structural tensors raised to the degree corresponding to the value of spin s. We verified this hypothesis for the case of spin three and four and showed that the construction of the conserved three-point function can be reduced to the algebraic task of canceling the right hand sides of the divergences of constructed terms. Moreover it follows from this consideration that for spin three and four cases our solutions can be interpreted as the $CFT$-dual to the cubic interaction in the AdS space with one dimension more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple derivation of MHV amplitudes in massless spinor and scalar electrodynamics. Working with permutationally invariant amplitudes, we show that they are fully determined by their soft photon behavior and admit a simple factorized form in terms of soft factors and lower-point amplitudes. We prove these formulae using recursion relations. Finally, we consider possible extensions of these results by looking at supersymmetric theories, amplitudes beyond the MHV sector, gravity, and theories with charged particles of higher spins.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature Casimir effect for a spinor field in cosmic dispiration spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the finite temperature Casimir effect for a massive spinor field in cosmic dispiration spacetime, formed by the combination of a cosmic string and a screw dislocation using the generalized zeta function regularization method. First, we examine the cosmic string spacetime with a quasi-antiperiodic boundary condition, where the Casimir energy and its corrections depend on two nonzero heat kernel coefficients, one associated with the Euclidean divergence and the other with the nontrivial topology, both vanishing when renormalized. Interestingly, for specific choice of parameters the quasi-antiperiodicity effect can entirely cancel out the topological contribution, leaving only the Euclidean divergence. We then extend this analysis to cosmic dispiration spacetime. This configuration alters the spacetime topology, modifying the structure of the heat kernel coefficient related to the new nontrivial topology. In this case, the renormalized Casimir energy density can take positive or negative values and decreases exponentially as the field mass increases. Additionally, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the renormalized temperature correction term in the massless regime, showing that the spinor vacuum free energy vanishes at very high temperatures. At very low temperatures, it is dominated by the zero-temperature Casimir energy density.</description>

      <title>AdS/CFT Duality and Anyons in $SU(N)_k$ Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the holographic realization of anyons in \(SU(N)_k\) Chern-Simons theory within the AdS/CFT framework. The study extends traditional models, such as \(SU(2)\), to higher-rank groups like \(SU(3)\) and \(SU(4)\), focusing on the fusion, braiding, and quantum dimensions of anyons. A correspondence between Wilson loops in the bulk and boundary defect operators is established, demonstrating how the modular data of Chern-Simons theory relates to the boundary conformal field theory (CFT). The topological defects, fusion algebras, and operator spectra are analyzed from both the bulk and boundary perspectives, highlighting the relationship between bulk topological defects and boundary operators. Additionally, a conjecture is made that the boundary operator algebra forms a modular tensor category, providing a framework for exploring holographic dualities in topologically non-trivial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the connection between braid group representations, defect operators, and holography within the AdS/CFT framework. It focuses on the correspondence between bulk Wilson loops and boundary defect operators, emphasizing how braid group representations map to these operators. The study also explores fusion and braiding operations in modular tensor categories, which are crucial for understanding anyons in topological quantum field theories. By providing a unified framework, this work bridges the gap between bulk and boundary physics and offers insights into the holographic realization of topological defects. The results suggest new avenues for research in holographic anyons and their applications in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that scattering amplitudes on any gauge theory background admitting a coherent state description double copy to amplitudes in a curved spacetime. The metric of the spacetime is built from the gauge background using a notion of classical double copy which emerges naturally at the amplitude level. In the self-dual sector this map relates backgrounds which are exact vacuum solutions in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Scalar parity-odd trispectrum from gravitational Chern-Simons interaction vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore parity violation in a scalar trispectrum from a dynamical Chern-Simons gravity theory. So far, a graviton-mediated diagram with two vertexes being of general relativity has been studied in this theory by taking into account the impact of a modified dispersion relation of gravitons on graviton's bulk propagators. We instead study a parity-odd trispectrum from both a graviton-mediated diagram, where one of the two vertexes originates from the Chern-Simons term, and a contact diagram by using the bulk propagators in general relativity. After computing the scalar-scalar-tensor cubic interactions and the scalar quartic ones originating from the Chern-Simons term, first we show that the resultant parity-odd trispectrum vanishes in the case of Bunch-Davies initial conditions, which is consistent with a no-go theorem for a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum. Then, we discuss a way to acquire a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum from the viewpoint of non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10228v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and a novel quantity assessing their interplay - called anti-flatness, after a quantum quench of a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03093v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <title>A Note on Spinning Billiards and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of internal degrees of freedom - specifically spin - on the classical dynamics of billiard systems. While traditional studies model billiards as point particles undergoing specular reflection, we extend the paradigm by incorporating finite-size effects and angular momentum, introducing a dimensionless spin parameter $\alpha$ that characterizes the moment of inertia. Using numerical simulations across circular, rectangular, stadium, and Sinai geometries, we analyze the resulting trajectories and quantify chaos via the leading Lyapunov exponent. Strikingly, we find that spin regularizes the dynamics even in geometries that are classically chaotic: for a wide range of $\alpha$, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes at late times in the stadium and Sinai tables, signaling suppression of chaos. This effect is corroborated by phase space analysis showing non-exponential divergence of nearby trajectories. Our results suggest that internal structure can qualitatively alter the dynamical landscape of a system, potentially serving as a mechanism for chaos suppression in broader contexts.</description>

      <title>String Theory and Grand Unification Suggest a Sub-Microelectronvolt QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions, grand unification, and string theory are each compelling extensions of the Standard Model. We show that combining these frameworks imposes strong constraints on the QCD axion mass. Using unitarity arguments and explicit string compactifications - such as those from the Kreuzer-Skarke (KS) type IIB ensemble - we find that the axion mass is favored to lie within the range $10^{-11}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim$ $10^{-8}$ eV. This range is directly relevant for near-future axion dark matter searches, including ABRACADABRA/DMRadio and CASPEr. We argue that grand unification and the absence of proton decay suggest a compactification volume that keeps the string scale above the unification scale ($\sim$$10^{16}$ GeV), which in turn limits how heavy the axion can be. The same requirements limit the KS axiverse to have at most $\sim$47 axions. As an additional application of our methodology, we search for axions in the KS axiverse that could explain the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) hints of evolving dark energy but find none with high enough decay constant ($f_a \gtrsim 2.5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV); we comment on why such high decay constants and low axion masses are difficult to obtain in string compactifications more broadly.</description>

      <title>Strong-gravity precession resonances for binary systems orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems of compact objects in close orbit around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) may form in galactic nuclei, providing a unique environment to probe strong-gravity tidal effects on the binary's dynamics. In this work, we investigate precession resonances arising between the periastron precession frequency of a binary system and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH. By modeling the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole, we find that relativistic effects in the tidal field give rise to a significantly richer resonance spectrum compared to the Newtonian case. This result is supported by both perturbative and numerical analyses of the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the strong-gravity regime. Our results reveal new signatures for strong-gravity effects in such triple systems, with potential implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the treatment of gauge theories within the framework that is formed from combining the machinery of noncommutative symplectic geometry, as introduced by Kontsevich, with Costello's approach to effective gauge field theories within the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism; discussing the problem of quantization in this context, and identifying the relevant cohomology theory controlling this process. We explain how the resulting noncommutative effective gauge field theories produce classes in a compactification of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, when we pass to the large length scale limit. Within this setting, the large $N$ correspondence of 't Hooft -- describing a connection between open string theories and gauge theories -- appears as a relation between the noncommutative and commutative geometries. We use this correspondence to investigate and ultimately quantize a noncommutative analogue of Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic quantum universe in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantize a Bianchi IX universe in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. For analytical tractability, we consider the small anisotropy limit of the Bianchi IX, that is, a perturbative anisotropic deformation of a closed, homogeneous and isotropic universe. In the case of the projectable theory we further set the ``dark matter as integration constant'' to zero by assuming that the space consists of only one connected piece. In that limit and under the assumption, we first study the semi-classical WKB solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We find the wave function of the universe, up to an overall normalization, and estimate the semi-classical tunneling probability for the emergence of an expanding universe. We establish a dictionary of correspondence between the WKB wave functions in General Relativity and Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in the large-scale factor (or IR) limit. For a small universe (UV limit), on the other hand, due to contributions from higher-dimensional operators, the anisotropies decouple from the scale factor, a behavior significantly different from General Relativity, and analytic solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation beyond the WKB approximation can be found. The wave function of the scale factor satisfies the DeWitt criterion, whereas the wave functions of anisotropies resemble those of quantum harmonic oscillators. The quantum prediction for the initial condition of anisotropies is obtained in terms of the coupling parameters of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. We find a bound on the coupling parameters from the normalizability of the wave functions of anisotropies. Further, we calculate the expectation values for squared anisotropic shear and squared anisotropies in both the large universe and small universe limits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically construct static regular solutions describing wormholes that connect multiple asymptotic regions, supported by a phantom scalar field. The solutions are static and axially symmetric, and are constructed using the gravitational soliton formalism, in which the equations of motion reduce to the Laplace equations on a two-dimensional sheet. However, the presence of multiple asymptotic regions necessitates the introduction of multiple such sheets. These sheets are appropriately cut and glued together to form a globally regular geometry. This gluing procedure represents the principal distinction from conventional Weyl-type solitonic solutions and is a characteristic feature of the wormhole geometries studied in this paper.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse of matter fields in de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of matter fields in the de Sitter universe. The energy-momentum tensor of the matter field is assumed to admit a wide variety including dust, perfect fluids with equations of state, fluids with tangential and radial pressure, and with bulk and shear viscosity. Under different initial conditions imposed on the velocity and the density profiles, and by combining the results from exact analytical methods with those obtained from numerical techniques, we track the formation and evolution of spherical marginally trapped spheres as the matter suffers continual gravitational collapse. We show that the quasilocal formalism of trapped surfaces provides an ideal framework to study the evolution of horizons. More precisely, black hole and cosmological horizons may be viewed as the time development of marginally trapped surfaces.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the inert Triplet desert region with a pNGB Dark Matter and its Gravitational Wave signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the scalar sector of the conventional hyperchargeless inert triplet model (ITM) to include a second dark matter (DM) candidate, which appears to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). The usual ITM with an extended scalar sector offers a DM candidate along with novel signatures at different experiments, e.g., colliders, gravitational wave detectors, etc. Nevertheless, hitherto unseen experimental detections have placed stringent constraints on the ITM parameter space. Moreover, triplet masses lighter than $1.9$ TeV, consistent with the existing or upcoming collider sensitivity reach, are already excluded from the DM observable, as they yield an underabundant relic density due to a strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge annihilation. Inclusion of a pNGB DM, via a complex $SU(2)_L$ scalar singlet and through the soft-breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry, helps to revive the sub-TeV regime of the triplet DM. This resurgence relies on a proficient conversion between the two DM species. Using this inter-conversion, with the triplet DM as the lighter one between the two, we show that it is possible to push the triplet DM contribution to $50\% - 60\%$ of the total relic density. This offers a significant improvement over the traditional ITM with a single DM candidate, where the same can at most reach $10\% - 20\%$. Besides, the concerned bipartite DM framework also offers the possibility of a first-order phase transition along various constituent field directions. Among these, the one along the real $SU(2)_L$ singlet direction can be a strong one which subsequently yields detectable gravitational wave signals at the upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc., alongside distinctive and complementary signatures at the various DM and collider quests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of an $\eta$-pseudo Hermitian Hamiltonian with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is reviewed and extended to include open system dynamics. Inspired by a simple light matter interaction open system model, information theoretic quantities like a non-Markovian witness and fidelity are calculated for the $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric Hamiltonian, and the results are compared with their corresponding Hermitian counterparts. The nature of entanglement between two $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric and Hermitian open quantum systems is calculated, and the contrast observed.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model of quantum cosmology: the Hydrogen atom analogy with dust and Cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with pressureless dust (modeled via the Brown-Kucha\v{r} formalism) and a dynamical cosmological constant $\Lambda$ treated in the unimodular gravity framework, where unimodular time serves as a relational clock. Remarkably, the quantum dynamics of this system exhibit a mathematical correspondence to a non-relativistic hydrogen atom -- $\Lambda$ maps to energy eigenvalues, the volume variable to the radial coordinate, and the dust energy density parameter to the Coulomb potential strength. This analogy yields a continuous spectrum for positive $\Lambda$, analogous to scattering states. For $\Lambda &gt; 0$, we prove the self-adjointness of the unimodular Hamiltonian, guaranteeing unitary evolution in unimodular time. By constructing wave packets from normalized stationary states, we demonstrate a quantum bounce that resolves the classical Big Bang singularity. The dynamics transition from semiclassical behavior far from the bounce to quantum-dominated regions featuring characteristic "ringing" oscillations due to interference near the bounce. We quantify quantum effects through expectation values and fluctuations of cosmological observables, finding evidence for persistent quantum effects in the late universe. Thus our results suggest that quantum gravitational effects may leave imprints on late-time cosmology, even beyond the bounce.</description>

      <title>Resolving the $\Delta(1232)$ partial width anomaly: Complex pole residue is not a fundamental resonance property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonant properties of excited hadrons are commonly identified with the complex pole positions and residues of the scattering amplitude. The mass and total decay width are given by position, whereas the partial width is given by the magnitude of the residue. If this identification was correct, the partial width of famous $\Delta(1232)$ would be larger than its total width. By using a simple model that predicts residue phases of prominent baryons $N^*$, $\Delta$, $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, and low mass mesons, we resolve this anomaly and show that the residue cannot be a fundamental resonant property.</description>

      <title>Derivative coupling in horizon brightened acceleration radiation: a quantum optics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) signifies a unique radiation process and provides a promising framework in exploring acceleration radiation in flat/ curved spacetime. Its construction primarily relies on the transition probability of an atom falling through a high-Q cavity while interacting with a quantum field. The HBAR effect has typically been explored in the context of minimal coupling between the atom and the field amplitude. However, the minimally coupled models are affected by the infrared (IR) divergences that arise in the massless limit of the quantum fields in (1+1) dimensions. Thus, in the present manuscript, we examine the HBAR process using both the point-like and finite size detectors coupled with the momentum of the field, which plays a crucial role in naturally resolving IR divergences. Our results suggest that the transition probability for the point-like detector is independent of its frequency. This can be interpreted as the influence of the local gravitational field which modifies the sensitivity of the detector to its frequency and broadens its effective frequency range. Through a comparative study based on the length of the detector, we find that for a detector with a smaller length, the steady state solution for the density matrix of the field vanishes. This may indicate the existence of a non equilibrium thermodynamic state under the condition of finite size detector-field interaction. These distinctive features are exclusive to the derivative coupling between the atom and the field, highlighting them as a compelling subject for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach and cosmological attractors in newer general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics of a class of symmetric teleparallel gravity theories known as ``newer general relativity'' using the methods of dynamical systems, restricted to the case of vacuum solutions with a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. For the most general class of theories, we study generic properties of the solutions, in particular their fixed points, asymptotic behavior and effective dark energy. We then apply this approach to two phenomenologically motivated subclasses of theories, which we study in full detail. For these theories, we derive the complete space of solutions and cosmological attractors, which we display in a number of phase diagram. Depending on the particular theory at hand, we find different possible scenarios, including a turnaround followed by a big crunch, a big rip and an eternally expanding universe whose Hubble parameter asymptotically approaches zero. It turns that this different behavior can be explained by the effective dark energy barotropic index, which shows either phantom or non-phantom behavior, depending on the theory, but does not change dynamically between these two possibilities.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating QED inspired superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied a Lorentz-violating inspired Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity where we considered a CPT-odd contribution given by $(k_{AF})^{\mu}$, also known as the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. In the static limit of the equations, we could find a pair of modified Ginzburg-Landau equations. Furthermore, these equations were reduced to the London equation for the magnetic field when assumed that the characteristic length of the order parameter is much smaller than the characteristic length of the magnetic field, i.e. the London penetration length. Our numerical solutions showed a simple Meissner state when this new term is small compared to $\lambda_L$ and a phase transition into phases with strong in-plane currents and anomalous vortices for large contributions. This model becomes useful in exemplifying the changes in the phenomenology of superconductors when the setup of the system shows an important breakdown of Lorentz invariance. Based on these results, we discuss how such models might be the hallmark of unusual superconducting states where there is a direction where the system shows stratification, as in anapole superconductors UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gravity from Topological Quantum Field Theory: Stochastic Gradient Flow Perspective away from the Quantum Gravity Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario according to which the ultraviolet completion of General Relativity is realized through a stochastic gradient flow towards a topological BF theory. Specifically, we consider the stochastic gradient flow of a pre-geometric theory proposed by Wilczek. Its infrared limit exists, and corresponds to a fixed point where stochastic fluctuations vanish. Diffeomorphism symmetries are restored in this limit, where the theory is classical and expressed by the Einstein-Hilbert action. The infrared phase then corresponds to the classical theory of General Relativity, the quantization of which becomes meaningless. Away from the infrared limit, in the pre-geometric phase of the stochastic gradient flow, the relevant fields of the Wilczek theory undergo stochastic fluctuations. The theory can be quantized perturbatively, generating corrections to the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. The stochastic gradient flow also possesses an ultraviolet fixed point. The theory flows to a topological BF action, to which general non-perturbative quantization methods can be applied. Two phase transitions occur along the thermal time dynamics, being marked by: i) the breakdown of the topological BF symmetries in the ultraviolet regime, which originates the pre-geometric phase described by the Wilczek theory; ii) the breakdown of the parental symmetries characterizing the Wilczek theory, from which General Relativity emerges. The problem of quantizing the Einstein-Hilbert action of gravity finally becomes redundant.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, for an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with arbitrary dynamical critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We present a comparative study where all of these methods yield exactly similar results for the butterfly velocity and Lyapunov exponent. This establishes an equivalence between all three methods for probing chaos in the chosen gravity background. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. In the classical approach, we comment on potential limitations while choosing the turning point of the null geodesic in our gravity background. All chaotic properties emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. Finally, we remark on a possible classical/quantum correspondence from the analysis of classical eikonal phase shift and Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using dispersion relations of the scattering amplitudes and semi-definite programming, we calculate causality bounds on the Wilson coefficients in scalar-tensor effective field theories that include parity-violating operators. Particular attention has been paid to the dynamical-Chern-Simons (dCS) and scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, along with higher order coefficients, and the interplay between them. For the leading terms, the bounds on the parity-conserving and -violating coefficients are simply projections of the complex coefficients. Some parity-violating coefficients are found to be upper bounded by the parity-conserving counterparts, or the higher order parity-conserving coefficients. While the observational constraints on parity-violating coefficients are weaker than the parity-conserving counterparts, the causality bounds are of comparable strength and thus may play a more prominent role in constraining strong gravity effects in upcoming observations.</description>

Abstract: As we know that due to the quantum gravitational effects black hole horizons are ``fractalized'' into a sphereflake by Barrow. Based on this issue, in this work we investigate the phase structure and stability of the Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS black holes with the fractal structure on the black hole horizon in the restricted phase space. Through the thermodynamics first law and the Smarr relation in the restricted phase space, we observe that the mass parameter is understood as the inter energy and the Smarr relation is not a homogeneous function of order one for all quantities due to the fractal structure. And the fractal structure can be regarded as a phase transition probe. When this system with the fixed central charge there exists a novel phenomena: the supercritical phase transition. Furthermore the effects of the fractal parameter and non-linear Yang-Mills parameter on the thermodynamics stability of this system are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of point-particle dynamics on higher-spin backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the light-cone gauge formalism to study interactions of point particles with massless higher-spin fields. By analysing the light-cone consistency conditions at the subleading order in higher-spin fields, we find that no local interactions of point particles with chiral higher-spin fields are possible. Considering that chiral higher-spin theories form inevitable closed subsectors of any consistent massless higher-spin theories in flat space, this conclusion holds more generally, in particular, it applies to putative parity-invariant completions of chiral higher-spin theories. Besides that, we argue that our result implies that Riemannian geometry cannot be extended to spaces with non-trivial higher-spin fields, in particular, there is no higher-spin extension of space-time interval. In the present paper we focus on a case of a massless particle, while a more technical massive case will be analysed in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

      <title>Dirac Singleton as a Relativistic Field Beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new interpretation of Dirac singletons \cite{Dirac:1963ta}, i.e. free conformal fields in $d$ dimensions, as relativistic fields in a $d+1$-dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, that differs from the Flato-Fronsdal dipole construction in $AdS_{d+1}$ \cite{Flato:1986uh}, is proposed. The $d+1$-dimensional field is described at the level of both equations and Lagrangian. It forms an infinite-dimensional representation of the $d+1$-dimensional Lorentz group that relates fields at different space-time points. The associated well-known fact is that singleton cannot be localized at a point in ${d+1}$ dimensions, hence being unobservable via local scattering/radiation phenomena in the Standard Model ($d=3$). On the other hand, that singleton respects ${d+1}$ dimensional relativistic symmetries makes it possible to introduce its interactions with gravity and other relativistic fields in $d+1$ dimensions. It is speculated that the presence of singleton in a four-dimensional field theory with non-zero cosmological constant (dark energy) can be relevant to the dark matter phenomenon and baryon asymmetry generation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of AdS Reissner Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m Black Holes with Euler Heisenberg Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study, situated within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, employs wave optics methods to investigate the Einstein ring structure of quantum corrected AdS Reissner Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes governed by Euler Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics. A wave source placed on the AdS boundary yields a response function on the antipodal side, from which a virtual optical system with a convex lens reconstructs the holographic image of the Einstein ring. The analysis systematically explores the impact of physical parameters and observer position on the ring's morphology. As the observer's position varies, the image transitions from a complete ring to an arc and eventually to a single bright point. The Einstein ring radius is observed to decrease with increasing radial source position $\rho$, wave frequency $\omega$, and chemical potential $\mu$, while it increases with electric charge $e$ and temperature $T$. In contrast, the quantum correction parameter $a$ has negligible effect on the ring radius or response amplitude, as its contribution falls off rapidly near the boundary and remains subleading in the wave dynamics. The parameter $e$ enhances the electromagnetic lensing strength, leading to a broader ring, whereas increasing $\rho$ alters wavefront propagation, affecting both brightness peak and ring location. Geometric optics analysis confirms that the incident angle of the photon ring matches the Einstein ring angle, validating consistency across frameworks. Overall, the results highlight how nonlinear electromagnetic effects and bulk field configurations manifest in observable boundary features, providing a means to distinguish quantum-corrected black holes from classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Anomaly Indicators of (2+1)-D Fermionic Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical proposal for the anomaly indicators of symmetries of (2+1)-d fermionic topological orders, and work out the consequences of our proposal in several nontrivial examples. Our proposal is an invariant of a super modular tensor category with a fermionic group action, which gives a (3+1)-d topological field theory (TFT) that we conjecture to be invertible; the anomaly indicators are partition functions of this TFT on $4$-manifolds generating the corresponding twisted spin bordism group. Our construction relies on a bosonization construction due to Gaiotto-Kapustin and Tata-Kobayashi-Bulmash-Barkeshli, together with a ``bosonization conjecture'' which we explain in detail. In the second half of the paper, we discuss several examples of our invariants relevant to condensed-matter physics. The most important example we consider is $\mathbb{Z}/4^T\times \mathbb{Z}/2^f$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^FC$, which many fermionic topological orders enjoy, including the $\mathrm{U}(1)_5$ spin Chern-Simons theory. Using newly developed tools involving the Smith long exact sequence, we calculate the cobordism group that classifies its anomaly, present the generating manifold, and calculate the partition function on the generating manifold which serves as our anomaly indicator. Our approach allows us to reproduce anomaly indicators known in the literature with simpler proofs, including $\mathbb{Z}/4^{Tf}$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^F$, and other symmetry groups in the 10-fold way involving Lie group symmetries.</description>

      <title>The long freeze: an asymptotically static universe from holographic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." In some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM. When nonrelativistic matter is added to the holographic dark energy, it tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. We show that a long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a more limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which induces correlations among pulsar timing residuals described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve. Standard calculations of the HD correlation and its variance assume an isotropic background. However, for a background of astrophysical origin, we expect a higher GW spectral density in directions with higher galaxy number densities. In a companion paper, we have developed a theoretical formalism to account for the anisotropies arising from large-scale galaxy clustering, leading to a new contribution to the variance of the HD correlation. In this subsequent work, we provide numerical results for this novel effect. We consider a GW background resulting from mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, and relate the merger number density to the overdensity of galaxies. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a standard deviation of the HD correlation at most at percent level, remaining well below the standard contributions to the HD variance. Hence, this kind of anisotropies in the GW source distribution does not represent a substantial contamination to the correlations of timing residuals in present and future PTA surveys. Suitable statistical methods to extract the galaxy clustering signal from PTA data will be investigated in the future.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the optical band gap through an effective Thirring interaction for massive Dirac-like electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze mass renormalization in massive Dirac-like systems in (2+1) dimensions arising from electron-phonon interactions at finite temperatures, employing the large-$N$ expansion. Our model combines the low-energy description of charge carriers in a buckled honeycomb lattice with the low-energy approximation for phonons and electron-phonon interactions in two-dimensional materials. Consequently, the system is modeled as a massive Dirac-like field coupled to a two-component vector field $\mathcal{A}_i$, representing the phonon modes. This framework allows us to compute the one-loop electron self-energy at finite temperature, from which we derive the renormalized band gap, $m^R$. The effective model is subsequently applied to describe the renormalized optical band gap in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$. A good agreement is observed with experimental data for reasonable values of the ultraviolet cutoff, $\Lambda \approx 1$ eV. Our main findings indicate that $m^R$ remains nearly constant at low temperatures, whereas at higher temperatures it decreases linearly with the temperature $T$. Specifically, we find that $m^R$ reduces by approximately $\approx [0.1,0.2]$ eV as the temperature increases from $\approx 4$ K to $500$ K, consistent with recent experimental observations. Furthermore, we estimate the temperature range at which the transition to the linear regime occurs, obtaining typical values within $\approx [110,150]$ K for the four materials under consideration.</description>

Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a three-dimensional (3D) tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical model) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, using layer susceptibility, we obtain the boundary operator expansion for the transverse and longitudinal modes within the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D in the context of boundary criticality.</description>

      <title>Resumming Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian gravitational waveform expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waveform emitted by a particle moving in a Schwarzschild geometry can be computed, in perturbation theory, as a double series expansion in the limit where distances are large with respect to the size of the horizon, $z=2M/r\ll 1$ (Post-Minkowskian approximation), but small with respect to the gravitational wavelength, $y=2{\rm i} \omega r\ll 1$ (Post-Newtonian approximation). While in the case of bounded systems the two expansions are linked, for scattering processes they describe complementary regions of spacetime. In this paper, we derive all order formulae for those two expansions of the waveform, where the entire dependence on the $y$ or $z$ variables is resummed under the assumption $\omega M\ll 1$. The results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the confluent Heun functions and provide a new derivation of the recently discovered Heun connection formulae. Similar results are found for the non-confluent Heun case. Finally, in the case of circular orbits we compute our formulae at order 30PN and show excellent agreement against solutions obtained via numerical integrations and the MST method.</description>

      <title>Quantum response theory and momentum-space gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame and present a comprehensive analysis that spans background dynamics, linear perturbations, thermodynamics, quantum gravity constraints and baryogenesis. Using a dynamical systems approach, we classify all analytical critical points for a representative set of scalar field potentials: axions (ALPs), cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential (ekpyrotic) with $\Lambda$, quintessence, and scalar field dark matter. We show that a chameleon-like coupling $f(\phi)=e^{\beta\phi}$ modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. Analytical transfer matrices for primordial tensor modes are derived, revealing a scale-dependent break in the gravitational-wave spectrum whose position and amplitude are fixed by the coupling parameter $\beta$. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. Penrose's Weyl-curvature hypothesis is recovered dynamically: during an ekpyrotic phase with $\omega\gg1$ the Weyl invariant decays as $a^{-6(1+\omega)}$, resetting gravitational entropy without violating the generalized second law. A time-varying $\phi$ simultaneously generates an effective chemical potential $\mu_{B}\simeq\beta\dot{\phi}/M^{2}$, allowing for spontaneous high-scale baryogenesis whose back reaction on $\phi$ is negligible for $M\gtrsim10^{15}\sqrt{\beta}$ GeV. Swampland distance and de Sitter criteria are automatically satisfied because the ekpyrotic phase confines the field excursion to $\Delta\phi\lesssim\mathcal{O}(1)M_{\rm Pl}$. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.</description>
