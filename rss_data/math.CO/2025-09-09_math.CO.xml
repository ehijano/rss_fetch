      <title>Order-generation in posets and convolution of closure operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Hofmann--Lawson theorem, which states that every continuous lattice is inf-generated by its irreducible elements, we explore how to represent posets by extreme points with respect to a closure operator. For this purpose, we introduce the convolution product of closure operators, and prove that the Krein--Milman property can be transferred from one collection of subsets to another by convolution. This result underpins two new representation theorems of topological flavor, which generalize existing ones, even in posets lacking lattice or semilattice structures. We also prove a third representation theorem: given a poset equipped with a closure operator $\mathfrak{c}$ with adequate properties, we show that the set of kit points, defined as an extension of compact points, has the Krein--Milman property with respect to the convolution product of $\mathfrak{c}$ with the dual Alexandrov operator $\uparrow\!\! \cdot$; moreover, every kit point is sup-generated by a unique antichain of compact points, finite if $\mathfrak{c}$ is finitary.</description>

      <title>On covering cubic graphs with 3 perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bridgeless cubic graph $G$, $m_3(G)$ is the ratio of the maximum number of edges of $G$ covered by the union of $3$ perfect matchings to $|E(G)|$. We prove that for any $r\in [4/5, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cubic graphs $G$ such that $m_3(G) = r$. For any $r\in [9/10, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cyclically $4$-connected cubic graphs $G$ with $m_3(G) = r$.</description>

      <title>Orientable triangular embeddings of the complete graphs on 36s vertices from noncyclic current graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mark Jungerman's 1975 Ph.D. thesis presents several infinite families of index 2 current graphs that generate triangular embeddings of complete or near-complete graphs. However, there is one family mentioned, the complete graphs on $36s$ vertices, where Jungerman solves only the first case $s = 1$. We generalize this example to all $s \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Almost all graphs have no cospectral mate with fixed level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haemers conjectures that almost all graphs are determined by their spectra. Suppose $G \sim \mathcal{G}(n, p)$ is a random graph with each edge chosen independently with probability $p$ with $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$. Then $$\Pr(G \text{ is not controllable}) + \sum_{\ell = 2}^{n^{n^2}} \Pr(G \text{ has a generalized copsectral mate with level } \ell) \to 0$$ as $n \to \infty$ implies that almost all graphs are determined by their generalized spectra. It is known that almost all graphs are controllable. We show that almost all graphs have no cospectral mate with fixed level $\ell$, namely $$\Pr(G \text{ has a copsectral mate with level } \ell) \to 0$$ as $n \to \infty$ for every $\ell \geq 2$. Consequently, $$\Pr(G \text{ has a generalized copsectral mate with level } \ell) \to 0$$ as $n \to \infty$ for every $\ell \geq 2$. The result can also be interpreted in the framework of random integral matrices.</description>

      <title>Frequencies of letters in infinite $k$-balanced sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency of letters in a symbolic sequence ${\bf u}$ over a finite alphabet is one of the basic characteristics of ${\bf u}$. The notion of $k$-balancedness captures the property that the number of any letter occurring in two arbitrary factors of ${\bf u}$ of equal length differs at most by $k$. For a fixed integer $k$ and alphabet size $d\in \mathbb N$, we discuss possible frequencies of letters in $k$-balanced $d$-ary sequences. For the size $d$ of the alphabet, we introduce the notion of balancedness threshold $BT(d)$ and give an upper bound on it, where $BT(d)$ is the minimum $k$ such that there exists a $k$-balanced sequence over a $d$-letter alphabet for all possible letter frequencies.</description>

      <title>A graph energy conjecture through the lenses of semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with independence number $\alpha(G)$. Let $\mathcal{E}(G)$ be the energy of a graph, defined as the sum of the absolute values of the adjacency eigenvalues of $G$. Using Graffiti, Fajtlowicz conjectured in the 1980s that $$\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}(G) \geq n - \alpha(G).$$ In this paper we derive a semidefinite program formulation of the graph energy, and we use it to obtain several results that constitute a first step towards proving this conjecture. In particular, we show that $$\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}(G) \geq n - \chi_f(\overline{G}) \quad \text{ and } \quad \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}(G) \geq n - H(G),$$ where $\chi_f(G)$ is the fractional chromatic number and $H(G)$ is Hoffman's ratio number. As a byproduct of the SDP formulation we obtain several lower bounds for the graph energy that improve and refine previous results by Hoffman (1970) and Nikiforov (2007). The later author showed that the conjecture holds for almost all graphs. However, the graph families known to attain the conjecture with equality are highly structured and do not represent typical graphs. Motivated by this, we prove the following bound in support of the conjecture for the class of highly regular graphs $$\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}(G) \geq n - \vartheta^-(G),$$ where $\vartheta^-$ is Schrijver's theta number.</description>

      <title>Chromatic numbers with open and nonzero local modular constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore chromatic numbers subject to various local modular constraints. For fixed $n$, we consider proper integer colorings of a graph $G$ for which the closed and open neighborhood sums have nonzero remainders modulo $n$ and provide bounds for the associated chromatic numbers $\chi_n(G)$ and $\chi_{(n)}(G)$, respectively. In addition, we provide bounds for $\chi_{(n,k)}(G)$, the minimal order of a proper integer coloring of $G$ with open neighborhood sums congruent to $k\mod n$ (when such a coloring exists) as well as precise values for certain families of graphs.</description>

      <title>Free modules of splines on edge-labeled graphs over $k[x,y]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first prove that the ring of graph splines over an edge-labeled graph is isomorphic to the limit of a diagram associated to the edge-labeled graph. This is used to establish a local--global principle for graph splines. We then use this to prove that the module of graph splines on an edge-labeled graph over $k[x,y]$ is free when the graph is locally trivial or determined by a cycle over suitable open sets. Finally, we describe how deletion and contraction on an edge-labeled graph affect the spectrum of the ring of splines.</description>

      <title>Golden Ratio Growth and Phase Transitions in Chromatic Counts of Circular Chord Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalized circular chord graphs $\mathcal C^{(k)}_n$, formed from a cycle $C_n$ by adding fixed-offset chords of length $k$ and, for even $n$, diameters. Using transfer matrix methods, we derive exact formulas for 3-colorings when $k=3$: for odd $n$, we obtain \[ P(\mathcal{C}_n^{(3)},3) = L_n + 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{3}\right) + 2s_n + 2 \] where $L_n$ is the Lucas sequence and $(s_n)$ satisfies $s_{n+3} = -s_{n+2} - s_n$, yielding golden-ratio asymptotic growth $\varphi^n + O(\rho^n)$ along odd indices. For even $n$, we construct a paired-window transfer matrix that exactly enumerates $P(\mathcal{C}_{2m}^{(3)},3)$ while capturing diameter constraints. The chromatic counts exhibit pronounced modular patterns across residue classes without universal vanishing rules (see OEIS A383733). We provide efficient algorithms for exact enumeration and demonstrate applications to cyclic scheduling problems where these results serve as feasibility engines for airline gate assignment, wireless sensor networks, and multiprocessor task coordination.</description>

      <title>Minimal elements in the skew extended 0-Hecke poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05918v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The row-strict 0-Hecke action on standard immaculate skew tableaux was studied by the present authors, who showed that it gives rise to a bounded poset, called the \emph{skew immaculate Hecke poset}, and consequently to a cyclic 0-Hecke module. It was further shown that the subposet of skew standard extended immaculate tableaux always has a unique maximal element, but may have multiple minimal elements. In this paper we focus on these minimal elements, completely classifying them for a family of skew shapes that we call \emph{lobsters}. Moreover, we prove that when the skew shape is connected, the skew extended Hecke poset does have a unique minimal element, thereby showing that the associated 0-Hecke module is cyclic for both the row-strict and the dual immaculate actions.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood Balanced k-Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph G = (V, E) and a positive integer k greater than or equal to 2, a coloring of vertices of G using exactly k colors such that each vertex has an equal number of neighbors of each color is called neighborhood-balanced k-coloring, and the graph is called a neighborhood-balanced k-colored graph. This generalizes the notion of neighborhood balanced coloring of graphs introduced by Bryan Freyberg and Alison Marr (Graphs and Combinatorics, 2024). We derive some necessary/sufficient conditions for a graph to admit a neighborhood-balanced k-coloring and discuss several graph classes that admit such colorings. We also show that the problem of determining whether a given graph has such a coloring is NP-complete. Furthermore, we prove that there is no forbidden subgraph characterization for the class of neighborhood-balanced k-colorable graphs.</description>

      <title>The limit of repetition thresholds of rich sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The repetition threshold of a class of sequences is the smallest number $r$ such that a sequence from the class contains no repetition with exponent $&gt; r$. We focus on the class $\mathcal{C}_d$ of $d$-ary sequences rich in palindromes. In 2020, Currie, Mol, and Rampersad determined the repetition threshold for $\mathcal{C}_2$. In 2024, Currie, Mol and Peltom\"aki found the repetition threshold for $\mathcal{C}_3$ and conjectured that the repetition threshold for $\mathcal{C}_d$ tends to 2 with $d$ growing to infinity. Here we verify their conjecture.</description>

      <title>Planar Tur\'{a}n numbers of three configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Tu\'{a}n number of $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is defined as the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. The exact value of $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$ remains a mystery when $H$ is large (for example, $H$ is a long path or a long cycle), while tight bounds have been established for many small planar graphs such as cycles, paths, $\Theta$-graphs and other small graphs formed by a union of them.
  One representative graph among such union graphs is $K_1+L$ where $L$ is a linear forest without isolated vertices.
  Previous works solved the cases when $L$ is a path or a matching.
  In this work, we first investigate the planar Tur\'{a}n number of the graph $K_1+L$ when $L$ is the disjoint union of a $P_2$ and $P_3$.
  Equivalently, $K_1+L$ represents a specific configuration formed by combining a $C_3$ and a $\Theta_4$.
  We further consider the planar Tur\'{a}n numbers of the all graphs obtained by combining $C_3$ and $\Theta_4$. Among the six possible such configurations, three have been resolved in earlier works. For the remaining three configurations (including
  $K_1+(P_2\dot{\cup}P_3)$), we derive tight bounds. Furthermore, we completely characterize all extremal graphs for the remaining two of these three cases.
  Additionally, for two other unsolved cases involving
  $K_1+L$, we establish improved bounds.</description>

      <title>Separable convex optimization over indegree polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study egalitarian (acyclic) orientations of undirected graphs under indegree-based objectives, such as minimizing the $\varphi$-sum of indegrees for a strictly convex function $\varphi$, decreasing minimization (dec-min), and increasing maximization (inc-max). In the non-acyclic setting of Frank and Murota (2022), a single orientation simultaneously optimizes these three objectives, however, restricting to acyclic orientations confines us to the corners of the indegree polytope, where these fairness objectives do diverge. We establish strong hardness results across a broad range of settings: minimizing the $\varphi$-sum of indegrees is NP-hard for every discrete strictly convex function $\varphi$; dec-min and inc-max are NP-hard for every indegree bound $k \geq 2$, as well as without a bound; and the complementary inc-min and dec-max problems are NP-hard even on $3$-regular graphs. On the algorithmic side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for minimizing the maximum weighted indegree via a weighted smallest-last ordering. We also provide an exact exponential-time algorithm for minimizing general separable discrete convex objectives over indegrees, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the non-acyclic case. Finally, for maximizing the sum of the products of indegrees and outdegrees, we prove NP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree $4$, give an algorithm for maximum degree $3$, and provide a $3$-approximation algorithm. Our results delineate the algorithmic frontier of convex integral optimization over indegree (base-)polytopes, and highlight both theoretical consequences and practical implications, notably for scheduling and deadlock-free routing.</description>

      <title>A Composition-Based Approach to EKR Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal F}$ be a family of subsets of a finite set $X$. A subfamily of ${\mathcal F}$ is intersecting if any two members of ${\mathcal F}$ has nonempty intersection. We say ${\mathcal F}$ has the EKR property, if, for any fixed element of $X$ the subfamily of all sets in $\mathcal{F}$ that contain $x$ is an intersecting subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ of possible maximum size. We say ${\mathcal F}$ has the strong EKR property (the strong EKR property), if every intersecting subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ of maximum size is of the form consisting of all members that contain a fixed element of $X$.
  In this paper, we introduce a general compositional framework for proving the EKR property and the strong EKR property for certain set systems. Our approach is based on a composition lemma, which we develop and explain in detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this tool, we present simple proofs of several previously known results in the field.
  As an application, we show that for every fixed $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and all sufficiently large integers $n$, the family of all subhypergraphs of the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices that are isomorphic to $H$ satisfies the strong EKR property, where two copies of $H$ are considered intersecting if they share at least one common hyperedge. This result provides a notable generalization of the earlier work of Meagher and Moura, Kamat and Misra, and of Borg and Meagher on the strong EKR property for
  perfect machings and $k$-matchings in complete graphs.
  We establish an explicit linear bound in $k$ on the number of vertices of complete and complete bipartite graphs such that the family of $k$-cycles in $K_n$ and $K_{n,n}$ satisfies the EKR and strong EKR properties.</description>

      <title>Finite projective planes meet spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any connected graph $G$ with maximum degree $d\ge3$, the spectral gap from $0$ with respect to the adjacency matrix is at most $\sqrt{d-1}$. We further show that the upper bound $\sqrt{d-1}$ is achieved if and only if $G$ is the incidence graph of a finite projective plane of order $d-1$; and for other cases, the upper bound can be improved to $\sqrt{d-2}$.
  A similar yet more subtle phenomenon involving the normalized Laplacian is also investigated, in which we work on graphs of degrees $\ge d$ rather than $\le d$. We prove that for any graph $G$ with \emph{minimum} degree $d\ge 3$, the spectral gap from the value 1 with respect to the normalized Laplacian is at most $\sqrt{d-1}/d$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the incidence graph of a finite projective plane of order $d-1$.
  These results are spectral gap analogues to an inequality involving HL-index by Mohar and Tayfeh-Rezaie, as well as an estimate of the energy per vertex by van Dam, Haemers and Koolen. Moreover, we provide a new sharp bound for the convergence rate of some eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the (weighted) neighborhood graphs introduced by Bauer and Jost.</description>

      <title>On graphs, homology bases, and triangulated homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a construction that takes as input a graph and a basis for its first homology, and returns a triangulation of a 3-dimensional homology sphere. This makes precise an idea of M. Gromov and A. Nabutovski. The immediate application, essentially described by Gromov, is to translate problems about asymptotics of homology sphere triangulations to asymptotic counting problems for constant-degree graphs with "short" homology bases. We construct families of 3- sphere triangulations with dual graphs that are expanders, answering a relaxation of a question asked by G. Kalai. Our results also imply that if the number of d-dimensional triangulated homology spheres with n facets is superexponential in n for some d then the same holds for d = 3.</description>

      <title>Proper conflict-free degree-choosability of outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ is called a proper conflict-free coloring of $G$ if for every non-isolated vertex $v$ of $G$, there is a color $c$ such that $|\phi^{-1}(c)\cap N_G(v)|=1$. As an analogy to degree-choosability of graphs, the authors recently, in a previous paper, introduced the notion of proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs. For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable if for any list assignment $L$ of $G$ with $|L(v)|\geq d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$, $G$ admits a proper conflict-free coloring $\phi$ such that $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. In this paper, we show that every connected outerplanar graph other than the $5$-cycle is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+2)$-choosable. This bound is tight in the sense that there are infinitely many connected outerplanar graphs that are not proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+1)$-choosable. We conclude the paper with two questions for further work.</description>

      <title>Slice rank and partition rank of the determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laplace expansion expresses the $n \times n$ determinant $\det_n$ as a sum of $n$ products. Do shorter expansions exist? In this paper we:
  - Fully determine the slice rank decompositions of $\det_n$ (where each product must contain a linear factor): In this case, we show that $n$ summands are necessary, and moreover, the only such expansions with $n$ summands are equivalent (in a precise sense) to the Laplace expansion. 
  - Prove a logarithmic lower bound for the partition rank of $\det_n$ (where each product is of multilinear forms): In this case, we show that at least $\log_2(n)+1$ summands are needed. We also explain why existing techniques fail to yield any nontrivial lower bound, and why our new method cannot give a super-logarithmic lower bound.
  - Separate partition rank from slice rank for $\det_n$: we find a quadratic expansion for $\det_4$, over any field, with fewer summands than the Laplace expansion. This construction is related to a well-known example of Green-Tao and Lovett-Meshulam-Samorodnitsky disproving the naive version of the Gowers Inverse conjecture over small fields.
  An important motivation for these questions comes from the challenge of separating structure and randomness for tensors. On the one hand, we show that the random construction fails to separate: for a random tensor of partition rank $r$, the analytic rank is $r-o(1)$ with high probability. On the other hand, our results imply that the determinant yields the first asymptotic separation between partition rank and analytic rank of $d$-tensors, with their ratio tending to infinity with $d$.</description>

      <title>On the recognition problem for limits of entropy functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there is no algorithm to decide whether a given integer vector is in the closure of the entropic cone $\overline{\Gamma_{n}^{*}}$. Equivalently, there is no decision procedure to determine whether a given integer-valued function $h:\mathcal{P}(\{1,\ldots,n\})\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ is a pointwise limit of joint entropy functions. In other words, given such an $h$, it is undecidable whether for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a finite probability space $(\Omega,P)$ with random variables $X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}$ such that their joint entropy $H$ satisfies $\max_{I\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}}\left|H\left(X_{I}\right)-h\left(I\right)\right|&lt;\varepsilon$. This settles the last open case in a sequence of related undecidability results proved by L. K\"{u}hne and the author, with applications in algorithmic information theory. The main new tool is a Desargues'-type theorem for almost entropic polymatroids.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture of Voss on bridges of longest cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridges are a classical concept in structural graph theory and play a fundamental role in the study of cycles. A conjecture of Voss from 1991 asserts that if disjoint bridges $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_k$ of a longest cycle $L$ in a $2$-connected graph overlap in a tree-like manner (i.e., induce a tree in the {\it overlap graph} of $L$), then the total {\it length} of these bridges is at most half the length of $L$. Voss established this for $k \leq 3$ and used it as a key tool in his 1991 monograph on cycles and bridges. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture in full via a reduction to a cycle covering problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1920, MacMahon introduced two families of $q$-series to study divisor sums. Recent work has shown that MacMahon's $q$-series are closely connected to overpartitions and $3$-colored partitions. Merca introduced truncated forms of MacMahon's $q$-series to generalize earlier results by Andrews-Rose and Ono-Singh, and posed two conjectures regarding the $q$-binomial expansions of these truncated series. In this paper, we provide combinatorial proofs of Merca's conjectures through the combinatorial interpretation of $q$-binomial coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{d},p)$ be the maximum possible size of a point set in general position in a $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{d},p)$ up to a polylogarithmic factor by proving the balanced supersaturation conjecture of Balogh and Luo. Our result also resolves a conjecture implicitly posed by the first author, Liu, the second author and Zeng. In the course of our proof, we establish a lemma that demonstrates a ``structure vs. randomness'' phenomenon for point sets in finite-field linear spaces, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In 1968, Ringel and Youngs solved the remaining cases of the orientable Map Color Theorem by finding genus embeddings of the complete graphs $K_n$, for sufficiently large $n \equiv 2, 8, 11 \pmod{12}$. Following the approach previously explored by the author for $n \equiv 8 \pmod{12}$, we aim to streamline their constructions for $n \equiv 2, 11 \pmod{12}$ by finding families of current graphs with simpler patterns for the arc labelings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a limit theory for $1$-cochains of complete graphs with coefficients from a finite abelian group. We prove an analogue of the large deviation principle of Chatterjee and Varadhan for random cochains. We use these new tools to prove results about the homology of random $2$-dimensional simplicial complexes.
  More specifically, we prove that if $T_n$ is a random $2$-dimensional determinantal hypertree on $n$ vertices and $p$ is any prime, then \[\frac{\dim H_1(T_n,\mathbb{F}_p)}{n^2}\] converges to zero in probability. The same result holds for random $1$-out 2-complexes.</description>

      <title>On the sum of the largest and smallest eigenvalues of graphs with high odd girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum $\lambda_1 + \lambda_n$ of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues, and the odd girth of a graph both measure bipartiteness. We seek to relate these measures. In particular, for an odd integer $k\geq 3$, let $\gamma_k$ denote the supremum of $\frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_n}{n}$ over graphs without odd cycles of length less than $k$. The example of the $k$-cycle $C_k$ shows that $\gamma_k\geq \Omega(k^{-3})$. In their recent work, Abiad, Taranchuk, and van Veluw showed that $\gamma_k\leq O(k^{-1})$ and asked to determine the asymptotics of $\gamma_k$. Using approximation theory, we show that $\gamma_k\leq O(k^{-3}\log^3 k)$, giving a tight upper bound up to a poly-logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Completely (Quasi-)Uniform Nested Boolean Steiner Quadruple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested Steiner quadruple systems are designs derived from Steiner quadruple systems (SQSs) by partitioning each block into pairs. A nested SQS is completely uniform if every possible pair appears with equal multiplicity, and completely quasi-uniform if every pair appears with multiplicities that differ by at most one. An explicit construction on the Boolean SQS of order $2^m$ is presented. For every integer $m \ge 3$, this gives a nested SQS$(2^m)$ that is completely uniform when $m$ is odd and completely quasi-uniform when $m$ is even. These results resolve two open problems posed by Chee et al.~(2025).
  The notion of completely uniform pairings is further generalized to $t$-designs with $t \ge 2$. In particular, the existence of completely uniform $2$-$(2^m,4,3)$ nested designs is established for all $m \ge 3$, together with their connection to nested SQS$(2^m)$. As an application, such nested designs give rise to fractional repetition codes with zero skip cost, requiring fewer storage nodes than constructions based on SQSs. In addition, small examples are provided for non-Boolean orders, establishing the existence of completely uniform nested SQS$(v)$ for all $v \le 50$.</description>

      <title>No Infinite $(p,q)$-Theorem for Piercing Compact Convex Sets with Lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An infinite $(p,q)$-theorem, or an $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem, involving two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of sets, states that if in every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$, there are $q$ sets that are intersected by some set in $\mathcal{G}$, then there is a finite set $S_{\mathcal{F}}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$ such that for every $C\in\mathcal{F}$, there is a $B\in S_{\mathcal{F}}$ with $C\cap B\neq\emptyset$. We provide an example demonstrating that there is no $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem for piercing compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with lines by constructing a family $\mathcal{F}$ of compact convex sets such that it does not have a finite line transversal, but for any $t\in\mathbb{N}$, every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$ contains $t$ sets that are pierced by a line.</description>

      <title>Planar Graphs with Ore-degree at Most seven is strongly $13$-edge-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of edges of $G$ such that every color class forms an induced matching. The strong chromatic index is the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph. The Ore-degree $\theta(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum sum of degrees of adjacent vertices. We show that every planar graph $G$ with $\theta(G)\le 7$ has strong chromatic index at most $13$. This settles a conjecture of Chen et al in the planar case. We use a discharging method, and apply Combinatorial Nullstellensatz to show reducible configurations. We provide an algorithm to allow Combinatorial Nullstellansatz extracting coefficients from large polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Graev introduced the construction of a convex polytope associated with a symmetric ternary relation. He showed that the number of left-invariant Einstein metrics on a homogeneous space under some conditions is no more than the normalized volume of certain polytope of such form. It happens that the construction of a cosmological polytope introduced by Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa and Postnikov for computation of the wave function of the Universe is the special case of the Graev construction. The paper is devoted to unification of these two theories from combinatorial perspective.</description>

      <title>The slice decomposition of planar hypermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slice decomposition is a bijective method for enumerating planar maps (graphs embedded in the sphere) with control over face degrees. In this paper, we extend the slice decomposition to the richer setting of hypermaps, naturally interpreted as properly face-bicolored maps, where the degrees of faces of each color can be controlled separately. This setting is closely related with the two-matrix model and the Ising model on random maps, which have been intensively studied in theoretical physics, leading to several enumerative formulas for hypermaps that were still awaiting bijective proofs.
  Generally speaking, the slice decomposition consists in cutting along geodesics. A key feature of hypermaps is that the geodesics along which we cut are directed, following the canonical orientation of edges imposed by the coloring. This orientation requires us to introduce an adapted notion of slices, which admit a recursive decomposition that we describe.
  Using these slices as fundamental building blocks, we obtain new bijective decompositions of several families of hypermaps: disks (pointed or not) with a monochromatic boundary, cylinders with monochromatic boundaries (starting with trumpets or cornets having one geodesic boundary), and disks with a "Dobrushin" boundary condition. In each case, the decomposition ultimately expresses these objects as sequences of slices whose increments correspond to downward-skip free (Lukasiewicz-type) walks subject to natural constraints.
  Our approach yields bijective proofs of several explicit expressions for hypermap generating functions. In particular, we provide a combinatorial explanation of the algebraicity and of the existence of rational parametrizations for these generating functions when face degrees are bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers $1 &lt; k &lt; d-1$ and $r \ge k+2$, we establish new lower bounds on the maximum number of points in $[n]^d$ such that no $r$ lie in a $k$-dimensional affine (or linear) subspace. These bounds improve on earlier results of Sudakov-Tomon and Lefmann. Further, we provide a randomised construction for the no-four-on-a-circle problem posed by Erd\H{o}s and Purdy, improving Thiele's bound. We also consider the random construction in higher dimensions, and improve the bound of Suk and White for $d \geq 4$. In each case, we apply the deletion method, using results from number theory and incidence geometry to solve the associated counting problems.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Quantum State Transfer with a Generalized Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks generated by the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian are known to exhibit low transfer fidelity on general graphs. In this paper, we study continuous-time quantum walks governed by the generalized Laplacian operator L_k = A+kD, where A is the adjacency matrix, D is the degree matrix, and k is a real-valued parameter. Recent work of Duda, McLaughlin, and Wong showed that in the single-excitation Heisenberg (XYZ) spin model, one can realize walks generated by this family of operators on signed weighted graphs. Motivated by earlier studies on vertex-weighted graphs, we demonstrate that for certain graphs, tuning the parameter k can significantly enhance the fidelity of state transfer between endpoints.</description>

      <title>Hyperpfaffian Correlations for Beta-Ensembles: Beta an Even Square Integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a hyperpfaffian formulation for correlation functions in $\beta$-ensembles of $M \times M$ random matrices when $\beta = L^2$ is an even square integer. More specifically, to the $m$th correlation function $R_m : \R^m \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ we associate the $L$-vector valued function $\omega_m : \R^m \rightarrow \Lambda^L \R^{L(M-m)}$ such that $R_m(\mathbf y)$ is given by the Vandermonde determinant in $y_1, \ldots, y_M$ times the hyperpfaffian of $\omega_m.$ The partition function of the ensemble was previously shown to be the hyperpfaffian of a {\it Gram} $L$-form $\omega$ in $\Lambda^L \R^{LM},$ and we demonstrate the relationship between $\omega_m(\mathbf y)$ and $\omega$, both having coefficients built from integrals of Wronskians of monic polynomials. Assuming the existence of families of polynomials sympathetic with the weight of the ensemble, we may construct $\omega(\mathbf y)$ so it is very sparse (relative to the expected ${L(M-m) \choose L}$ coefficients of a general $L$-vector). These generalize skew-orthogonal polynomials arising in the well-understood $\beta = 4$ situation. Finally we explore the situation in the circular $\beta = L^2$ ensembles. Here the monomials give a prototype, and we give explicit formulas for (the circular versions of) $\omega$ and $\omega_m.$ We use our hyperpfaffian framework to produce exact formulas for the two point function when $\beta = 16$ for small values $M.$ Along the way we will record hyperpfaffian evaluations using known values of partition functions of $\beta$-ensembles.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Low Soundness Homomorphism Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework to design and analyze algorithms for the problem of testing homomorphisms between finite groups in the low-soundness regime.
  In this regime, we give the first constant-query tests for various families of groups. These include tests for: (i) homomorphisms between arbitrary cyclic groups, (ii) homomorphisms between any finite group and $\mathbb{Z}_p$, (iii) automorphisms of dihedral and symmetric groups, (iv) inner automorphisms of non-abelian finite simple groups and extraspecial groups, and (v) testing linear characters of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and finite-dimensional Lie algebras over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also recover the result of Kiwi [TCS'03] for testing homomorphisms between $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$.
  Prior to this work, such tests were only known for abelian groups with a constant maximal order (such as $\mathbb{F}_q^n$). No tests were known for non-abelian groups.
  As an additional corollary, our framework gives combinatorial list decoding bounds for cyclic groups with list size dependence of $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (for agreement parameter $\varepsilon$). This improves upon the currently best-known bound of $O(\varepsilon^{-105})$ due to Dinur, Grigorescu, Kopparty, and Sudan [STOC'08], and Guo and Sudan [RANDOM'14].</description>

      <title>$q$-analogues of $\pi$-formulas due to Ramanujan and Guillera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first known $q$-analogues for any of the $17$ formulas for $\frac{1}{\pi}$ due to Ramanujan were introduced in 2018 by Guo and Liu (J. Difference Equ. Appl. 29:505-513, 2018), via the $q$-Wilf-Zeilberger method. Through a "normalization" method, which we refer to as EKHAD-normalization, based on the $q$-polynomial coefficients involved in first-order difference equations obtained from the $q$-version of Zeilberger's algorithm, we introduce $q$-WZ pairs that extend WZ pairs introduced by Guillera (Adv. in Appl. Math. 29:599-603, 2002) (Ramanujan J. 11:41-48, 2006). We apply our EKHAD-normalization method to prove four new $q$-analogues for three of Ramanujan's formulas for $\frac{1}{\pi}$ along with $q$-analogues of Guillera's first two series for $\frac{1}{\pi^2}$. Our normalization method does not seem to have been previously considered in any equivalent way in relation to $q$-series, and this is substantiated through our survey on previously known $q$-analogues of Ramanujan-type series for $\frac{1}{\pi}$ and of Guillera's series for $\frac{1}{\pi^2}$. We conclude by showing how our method can be adapted to further extend Guillera's WZ pairs by introducing hypergeometric expansions for $\frac{1}{\pi^2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real toric manifolds are the real loci of nonsingular complete toric varieties. In this paper, we calculate the integral cohomology groups of real toric manifolds in terms of the combinatorial data contained in the underlying simplicial fans, generalizing a formula due to Cai and Choi. We also present a combinatorial formula to describe the ring structure, modulo the ideal consisting of elements of order $2$. As an application, a combinatorial-algebraic criterion is established for when a real toric manifold is spin$^c$.</description>

      <title>Gathering in Non-Vertex-Transitive Graphs Under Round Robin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gathering problem for a swarm of robots asks for a distributed algorithm that brings such entities to a common place, not known in advance. We consider the well-known OBLOT model with robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph, hence gathering in one vertex, eventually. Despite the classical setting under which the problem has been usually approached, we consider the `hostile' case where: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities. As a scheduler for robot activation, we consider the "favorable" round-robin case, where robots are activated one at a time.
  Our objective is to achieve a complete characterization of the problem in the broad context of non-vertex-transitive graphs, i.e., graphs where the vertices are partitioned into at least two different classes of equivalence. We provide a resolution algorithm for any configuration of robots moving on such graphs, along with its correctness. Furthermore, we analyze its time complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competing urn model in which $m$ balls are placed independently into $n$ urns according to (possibly distinct) ball distributions. Kahn and Neiman (2010) showed that, under identical ball distributions, the induced urn measure has \emph{conditional negative association} property and asked whether this remains true without assuming identical distributions. We answer this in the affirmative by showing that the competing urn model satisfies the \emph{normalized matching property}. This, in turn, implies conditional negative association for the induced urn measure with non-identical ball distributions, resolving the question of Kahn and Neiman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilings of the plane resemble the simplicial and other complexes from algebraic topology, but have not been studied from this perspective. We construct finite categories corresponding to polygons with labeled directed edges, and introduce the problem of modeling tilings of the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane as presheaves over such a category. Combinatorially, this amounts to choosing an ``alignment'' for a tiling: a direction for every edge and consistent labels for the edges of each polygonal tile. We show that for a fixed tiling, given a single alignment we can characterize every other alignment of the same tiling by comparison of the edge directions. We then construct a ``reflective'' alignment for any tiling with an even number of polygons at each vertex, and from this generate a large family of alignments with elegant symmetry properties.</description>

Abstract: We study multiplicities $a^{d\lambda}_{\mu,(dk)}$ of highest weight representations $\mathbb S_{d\lambda}(\mathbb C^n)$, $\lambda\vdash pk$, of length at most $p$, in $\mathbb{S}_{\mu}(S^{dk}(\mathbb C^n))$, $\mu\vdash p$, so called plethysm coefficients, as $d$ tends to $\infty$. These are given by quasi-polynomials, which in the case of $S^p(S^{dk}(\mathbb C^n))$ can explicitly be computed by Pieri's rule. We show that for all but a finite, explicit list of $\lambda$'s the leading term is in fact constant and that $$
  a^{d\lambda}_{\mu,(dk)}\sim \frac{\dim V_\mu}{p!}c^{d\lambda}_{p,dk} $$ as $d\to\infty$. In particular, we answer a conjecture of Kahle and Micha\l ek, going back to Howe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</description>

Abstract: Suppose $n$ is the fundamental discriminant associated with a quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We show that for every Diophantine $m$-tuple $ \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m\} $ with the property $ D(n) $, there exists integral ideals $ \mathfrak{t}_1, \mathfrak{t}_2, \ldots, \mathfrak{t}_m $ of $ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n}) $ and $c\in \{1,2\}$ such that $ t_i= c\mathcal{N}(\mathfrak{t}_i) $ for $ i=1,2, \ldots, m $. Here, $ \mathcal{N}(\cdot) $ denotes the norm map from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ to $\mathbb{Q}$. Moreover, we explicitly construct the above ideals for Diophantine pairs $\{a_1, a_2\}$ whenever $\gcd(a_1, a_2) = 1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the possible bifurcations of periodic orbits by reducing them to graphs. The aforementioned allows to study the genericity of routes to chaos, as well as to analyze their possible complexity. In particular, our results show that there is no upper bound on the possible complexity. Moreover, it suggests general fermionic description via the virial expansion and universal description via the Rado graph.</description>

Abstract: We present an exposition of the Auinger-Steinberg proof of the Ribes-Zalesski\u{i} product theorem for pro-V topologies, where V is a pseudovariety of groups closed under extensions with abelian kernel. This proof is self-contained and is accessible to those acquainted with coverings of graphs, and as such, it provides an easy entry point to various other deep theorems for which the product theorem is formally equivalent to.</description>

Abstract: Whereas set-valued tableaux are the combinatorial objects associated to stable Grothendieck polynomials, hook-valued tableaux are associated to stable canonical Grothendieck polynomials. In this paper, we define a novel uncrowding algorithm for hook-valued tableaux. The algorithm "uncrowds" the entries in the arm of the hooks and yields a set-valued tableau and a column-flagged increasing tableau. We prove that our uncrowding algorithm intertwines with crystal operators. An alternative uncrowding algorithm that "uncrowds" the entries in the leg instead of the arm of the hooks is also given. As an application of uncrowding, we obtain various expansions of the canonical Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <title>Computing positroid cells in the Grassmannian of lines, their boundaries and their intersections</title>

Abstract: Positroids are families of matroids introduced by Postnikov in the study of non-negative Grassmannians. In particular, positroids enumerate a CW decomposition of the totally non-negative Grassmannian. Furthermore, Postnikov has identified several families of combinatorial objects in bijections with positroids. We will provide yet another characterization of positroids for Gr$_{\geq 0}(2,n)$, the Grassmannians of lines, in terms of certain graphs. We use this characterization to compute the dimension and the boundary of positroid cells. This also leads to a combinatorial description of the intersection of positroid cells, that is easily computable. Our techniques rely on determining different ways to enlarge a given collection of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ to represent the dependent sets of a positroid, that is the dependencies among the columns of a matrix with non-negative maximal minors. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to compute all the maximal positroids contained in a set.</description>

      <title>Intersection patterns, incidence theorems, and distance problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. One of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that \[|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.\] This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0&lt;x\le y&lt;2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)&gt;0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</description>

Abstract: Orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC for short) are a family of polynomials whose orthogonality is given by integration over the unit circle in the complex plane. There are combinatorial studies on the moments of various types of orthogonal polynomials, including standard orthogonal polynomials, Laurent biorthogonal polynomials, and orthogonal polynomials of type \( R_I \). In this paper, we study the moments of OPUC from a combinatorial perspective. We provide three path interpretations for them: \L{}ukasiewicz paths, gentle Motzkin paths, and Schr\"oder paths. Additionally, using these combinatorial interpretations, we derive explicit formulas for the generalized moments of some examples of OPUC, including the circular Jacobi polynomials and the Rogers--Szeg\H{o} polynomials. Furthermore, we introduce several kinds of generalized linearization coefficients and give combinatorial interpretations for them.</description>

Abstract: We use $P_t$ and $C_t$ to denote a path and a cycle on $t$ vertices, respectively. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges, a {\em hammer} is a graph obtained by identifying an endvertex of a $P_3$ with a vertex of a triangle. A class ${\cal F}$ is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(G)\leq f(\omega(G))$ for all induced subgraphs $G$ of a graph in ${\cal F}$. A class ${\cal C}$ of graphs is {\em Pollyanna} (resp. {\em linear-Pollyanna}) if ${\cal C}\cap {\cal F}$ is polynomially (resp. linear-polynomially) $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class ${\cal F}$ of graphs. Chudnovsky {\em et al} \cite{CCDO2023} showed that both the classes of bull-free graphs and hammer-free graphs are Pollyannas. Let $G$ be a connected graph with no clique cutsets and no universal cliques. In this paper, we show that $G$ is $(C_4$, hammer)-free if and only if it has girth at least 5, and $G$ is $(C_4$, bull)-free if and only if it is a clique blowup of some graph of girth at least 5. As a consequence, we show that both the classes of $(C_4$, bull)-free graphs and $(C_4$, hammer)-free graphs are linear-Pollyannas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials were introduced by Hwang, Jang, Kim, Song, and Song. There exist two combinatorial models for these polynomials: one using hook-valued tableaux and the other using pairs of a semistandard Young tableau and (what we call) an exquisite tableau. An uncrowding algorithm on hook-valued tableaux was introduced by Pan, Pappe, Poh, and Schilling. In this paper, we discover a novel connection between the two models via the uncrowding and Goulden--Greene's jeu de taquin algorithms, using a classical result of Benkart, Sottile, and Stroomer on tableau switching. This connection reveals a symmetry of the uncrowding algorithm defined on hook-valued tableaux. As a corollary, we obtain another combinatorial model for the refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials in terms of biflagged tableaux, which naturally appear in the characterization of the image of the uncrowding map.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Mutation-Acyclicity of Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers -- a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic. Our results demonstrate that ML models can efficiently detect mutation-acyclicity, providing a promising computational approach to this combinatorial problem, from which the trained SVM equation provides a starting point to guide future theoretical development.</description>

Abstract: Hertzsprung patterns, recently introduced by Anders Claesson, are subsequences of a permutation contiguous in both positions and values, and can be seen as a subclass of bivincular patterns.
  This paper investigates Hertzsprung patterns within involutions, where additional structural constraints introduce new challenges. We present a general formula for enumerating occurrences of these patterns in involutions.
  We also analyze specific cases to derive the distribution of all Hertzsprung patterns of lengths two and three.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Lehmer codes, with immersions in the Bruhat order, for several finite Coxeter groups, including all the classical Weyl groups. This allows to associate to each lower Bruhat interval of these groups a multicomplex whose f-polynomial is the Poincar\'e polynomial of the interval. Via a general construction, we prove that these polynomials are h-polynomials of vertex-decomposable simplicial complexes. Moreover we provide a classification, in terms of unimodal permutations, of Poincar\'e polynomials of smooth Schubert varieties in flag manifolds.</description>

      <title>On decycling and forest numbers of Cartesian products of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decycling number $\nabla(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to eliminate all cycles in $G$. The forest number $f(G)$ is the maximum number of vertices that induce a forest in $G$. So $\nabla(G) + f(G) = |V(G)|$. For the Cartesian product $T \,\square\, T'$ of trees $T$ and $T'$ it is proved that $\nabla(S_n \,\square\, S_{n'}) \leq \nabla(T \,\square\, T')$, thus resolving the conjecture of Wang and Wu asserting that $f(T \,\square\, T') \leq f(S_n \,\square\, S_{n'})$. It is shown that $\nabla(T \,\square\, T') \ge |V(T)| - 1$ and the equality cases characterized. For prisms over trees, it is proved that $\nabla(T\,\square\, K_2) = \alpha'(T)$, and for arbitrary graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, it is proved that $\nabla(G_1 \,\square\, G_2) \geq \alpha'(G_1) \alpha'(G_2)$, where $\alpha'$ is the matching number.</description>

Abstract: For a linear code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ and $\alpha \in [0,1]$, call a set $S \subseteq [n]$ an (unweighted) one-sided $\alpha$-sparsifier of $\mathcal{C}$ if for all $c \in \mathcal{C}$, $\mathrm{wt}(c_S)\geq \alpha \cdot \mathrm{wt}(c)$, where $c_S$ is the projection of $c$ onto the coordinates in $S$ and $\mathrm{wt}(c)$ is the Hamming weight of $c$. \\ We show that every $k$-dimensional linear code $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ has at least $2^{n - k}$ many unweighted one-sided $1/2$-sparsifiers and hence one of size at most $n/2 + O(\sqrt{n k})$. As an application, letting $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^E$ denote the cut-space of a graph $G=(V, E)$, we show a lower bound of $2^{\lvert E \rvert- (\lvert V \rvert - 1)}$ on the number of $1/2$-thin subgraphs of $G$ and the existence of a $1/2$-thin subgraph with at least $\lvert E \rvert /2-O(\sqrt{\lvert E \rvert \cdot \lvert V \rvert})$ edges. In contrast to previous results on thin subgraphs, our proofs are purely "combinatorial".</description>

Abstract: We elaborate on the intimate connection between the largest volume of an empty axis-parallel box in a set of $n$ points from $[0,1]^d$ and cover-free families from the extremal set theory. This connection was discovered in a recent paper of the authors. In this work, we apply a very recent result of Michel and Scott to obtain a whole range of new lower bounds on the number of points needed so that the largest volume of such a box is bounded by a given $\varepsilon$. Surprisingly, it turns out that for each of the new bounds, there is a choice of the parameters $d$ and $\varepsilon$ such that the bound outperforms the others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetric edge polytope ($\mathrm{SEP}$) of a finite simple graph $G$ is a centrally symmetric lattice polytope whose vertices are defined by the edges of the graph. Among the information encoded by these polytopes are the symmetries of the graph, which appear as symmetries of the polytope. We describe the rigid symmetries of these polytopes, and show that $\mathrm{SEP}$s are unitarily equivalent exactly when their associated graphs are isomorphic. We then find an explicit relationship between the relative volumes of the subsets of the symmetric edge polytope $\mathrm{SEP}$ fixed by the natural action of symmetric group elements and the symmetric edge polytopes of smaller graphs to which the subsets are linearly equivalent. We also provide a vertex description of the fixed polytopes and find a description of the symmetric edge polytopes to which they are equivalent, in terms of contractions of the graph $G$ induced by the cycle decompositions of the permutations under which the subsets are fixed. Specializations of our results provide equivalence and volume relationships for fixed polytopes of symmetric edge polytopes of complete graphs (equivalently, for fixed polytopes of root polytopes of type $A_n$), and describe the symmetry group of this family of polytopes.</description>

Abstract: Bent functions are Boolean functions that are maximally nonlinear. They can be represented as bent squares, i.e., square matrices for which each row and each column is the Walsh spectrum of a Boolean function. Using this representation, it is shown in this note that the number of bent functions in $n$ variables is at least $2^{n \cdot 2^{\frac{n}{2}} \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right)}$ for even integers $n$.</description>

      <title>Toward Vu's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2002, Vu conjectured that graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum codegree at most $\zeta \Delta$ have chromatic number at most $(\zeta+o(1))\Delta$. Despite its importance, the conjecture has remained widely open. The only direct progress so far has been obtained in the ``dense regime,'' when $\zeta$ is close to $1$, by Hurley, de Verclos, and Kang.
  In this paper we provide the first progress in the sparse regime $\zeta \ll 1$, the case of primary interest to Vu. We show that there exists $\zeta_0 &gt; 0$ such that for all $\zeta \in [\log^{-32}\Delta,\zeta_0]$, the following holds: if $G$ is a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum codegree at most $\zeta \Delta$, then $\chi(G) \leq (\zeta^{1/32} + o(1))\Delta$. We derive this from a more general result that assumes only that the common neighborhood of any $s$ vertices is bounded rather than the codegrees of pairs of vertices. Our more general result also extends to the list coloring setting, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Cycle-Edge Decompositions and Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An old conjecture of Erd{\H{o}}s and Gallai states that every $n$ vertex graph can be decomposed, that is $E(G)$ can be partitioned, into $O(n)$ cycles and edges. The covering version of this conjecture was proven by Pyber in 1985, where it was shown that all graphs can be covered by $n-1$ cycles and edges. The best upper bound on the number of cycles and edges required to decompose any graph is $O(n\log^*(n))$, which was recently shown by Buci{\'c} and Montgomery in 2023. Here $\log^*(n)$ denotes the iterated logarithm function. Meanwhile, a construction of Erd\H{o}s demonstrate that there exists graphs which require $(\frac{3}{2}-o(1))n$ cycles and edges to be decomposed. We prove all graphs with maximum degree at most $4$ can be decomposed into $n-1$ or fewer cycles and edges. We also show that every $n$ vertex claw-free graph can be decomposed into $n-1$ or fewer $2$-regular subgraphs and edges. Finally, we prove that every graph $G$ containing a cycle can be covered by $n-2$ or fewer cycles and edges. This improves Pyber's covering theorem by proving that $n-1$ cycles and edges are required only for trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.02448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study uniform bases for the ideal arrangements in all Lie types. Explicit uniform bases are given by Abe-Horiguchi-Masuda-Murai-Sato for types $A,B,C,G$ and we provide them for other types. Combining the explicit uniform bases with the work of Abe-Horiguchi-Masuda-Murai-Sato, we also obtain explicit presentations of the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties in all Lie types.</description>

      <title>Fractionally Calabi-Yau lattices that tilt to higher Auslander algebras of type A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bounded derived category of the lattice of order ideals of the product of two ordered chains is fractionally Calabi-Yau. We also show that these lattices are derived equivalent to higher Auslander algebras of type A. The proofs involve the study of intervals of the poset that have resolutions described with antichains having rigid properties. These two results combined corroborate a conjecture by Chapoton linking posets to Fukaya-Seidel Categories.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of numbers of $q$-step walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants can be associated with a formal cumulant expansion of the free energy of matrix models of exponential random graphs widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  We show that in three different asymptotic regimes, the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively. In certain cases, we obtain ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ in explicit form.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in corresponding ensembles of large random graphs. As a consequence, we indicate an asymptotic regime when in random graphs that we consider, the average vertex degree remains bounded while the total number of triangles infinitely increases, thus rigorously solving a graph collapse problem known in applications.</description>

      <title>On stabilizers in finite permutation groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We prove various results about partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have good properties. In particular, in every solvable permutation group there is a set-stabilizer whose orbits have length at most $6$, which is best possible and answers two questions of Babai. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length at most $10$, which is best possible. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>A geometric model for the non-$\tau$-rigid modules of type $\widetilde{D}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric model for the non-$\tau$-rigid modules over acyclic path algebras of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. Similar models have been provided for module categories over path algebras of types $A_n, D_n,$ and $\widetilde{A}_n$ as well as the $\tau$-rigid modules of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. A major draw of these geometric models is the "intersection-dimension formulas" they often come with. These formulas give an equality between the intersection number of the curves representing the modules in the geometric model and the dimension of the extension spaces between the two modules. This formula allows us to calculate the homological data between two modules combinatorially. Since there are infinitely many distinct homogeneous stable tubes in the regular component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of type $\widetilde{D}_n$, all of which are disjoint, our geometric data requires an extra decoration on the admissible edges in our geometric model to prevent intersections between curves corresponding to modules in distinct stable tubes of the Auslander-Reiten quiver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of the d-dimensional non-degenerate quadric hypersurface of characteristic p &gt; 2 is a rational function of p composed from the Ehrhart polynomials of integer polytopes. In consequence, we explain and recover a result of Gessel and Monsky and prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of quadrics of fixed characteristic is a decreasing function of dimension.</description>

      <title>Submonoids of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set $X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this task. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the symmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite partition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in semigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover that the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the idempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms and partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore, we show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains a finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$ generates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$ under a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for the symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of subsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate a conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.</description>
