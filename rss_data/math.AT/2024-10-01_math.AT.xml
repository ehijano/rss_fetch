      <title>The decomposition space perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to decomposition spaces and 2-Segal spaces, unifying the two perspectives. We begin by defining decomposition spaces using the active-inert factorization system on the simplicial category, and show their equivalence to 2-Segal spaces. Key results include the path space criterion, which characterizes decomposition spaces in terms of their upper and lower d\'ecalages, and the edgewise subdivision criterion. We also introduce free decomposition spaces arising from outer face complexes, providing a rich source of examples. Formal prerequisites are minimal -- readers should have a working knowledge of simplicial methods and basic category theory.</description>

      <title>The space of commuting elements in an exceptional Lie group and maps between classifying spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi$ be a discrete group, and let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group. $\mathrm{Hom}(\pi,G)_0$ denotes the null-component of the space of homomorphisms from $\pi$ to $G$, and $\mathrm{map}_*(B\pi,BG)_0$ denotes the null-component of the space of maps from $B\pi$ to $BG$. Since the classifying space functor is continuous, there is a continuous map $\Theta\colon\mathrm{Hom}(\pi,G)_0\to\mathrm{map}_*(B\pi,BG)_0$. Atiyah and Bott studied this map when $\pi$ is a surface group, and proved surjectivity in rational cohomology. In this paper, we obtain the condition that the map $\Theta$ is surjective or not in rational cohomology when $\pi$ is $\mathbf{Z}^m$ for $m\geq 3$ and $G$ is a compact connected Lie group.</description>

      <title>Hall algebras via 2-Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to Hall algebras from the perspective of $2$-Segal spaces or decomposition spaces, as introduced by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov and G\'{a}lvez-Carrillo, Kock and Tonks, respectively. We explain how linearizations of the $2$-Segal space arising as the Waldhausen $\mathcal{S}_{\bullet}$-construction of a proto-exact category recover various previously known Hall algebras. We use the $2$-Segal perspective to study functoriality of the Hall algebra construction and explain how relative variants of $2$-Segal spaces lead naturally to representations of Hall algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a construction and an algorithm, both based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), to tackle the problem of the isomorphism check of Orthogonal Arrays (OAs). Specifically, we associate to any binary OA a persistence diagram, one of the main tools in TDA, and explore how the Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams can be used to inform whether two designs are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Finite combinatorics implicit in the basic definitions of topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to see finite combinatorics of preorders implicit in the {text} of basic topological definitions or arguments in (Bourbaki, General topology, Ch.I), and define a concise combinatorial notation such that complete definitions of connectedness, compactness, contractibility, having a generic point, subspace, closed subspace, fit into $2$ or $4$ bytes. This notation is homotopy theoretic in nature, and is based on the following observation:
  A number of basic properties of continuous maps and topological spaces are defined using a single category-theoretic operation, taking left or right orthogonal complement with respect to the Quillen lifting property, repeatedly applied to a simple example illustrating the definition or its failure. Moreover, for most of these definitions this example can be chosen to be a map of finite topological spaces (=preorders) of size at most $5$. This includes the properties of a space being connected, compact, contractible, discrete, having a generic point, and a map having dense image, being the inclusion of an (open or closed) subspace, or of a component into a disjoint union, and others. Our reformulations illustrate the generative power of the lifting property as a means of defining basic mathematical properties starting from their simplest or typical example. The exposition is accessible to a student.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology classifies parameter dependence of patterns in Turing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper illustrates a further application of topological data analysis to the study of self-organising models for chemical and biological systems. In particular, we investigate whether topological summaries can capture the parameter dependence of pattern topology in reaction diffusion systems, by examining the homology of sublevel sets of solutions to Turing reaction diffusion systems for a range of parameters. We demonstrate that a topological clustering algorithm can reveal how pattern topology depends on parameters, using the chlorite--iodide--malonic acid system, and the prototypical Schnakenberg system for illustration. In addition, we discuss the prospective application of such clustering, for instance in refining priors for detailed parameter estimation for self-organising systems.</description>

      <title>Exact bounds for even vanishing of $K_* (\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that $K_{2i} (\mathbb{Z}/p^n) \neq 0$ if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \leq i \leq (p-1) p^{n-2}$, refining the even vanishing theorem of Antieau, Nikolaus and the first author in this case. As a corollary of our proof, we determine that the nilpotence order of $v_1$ in $\pi_* K(\mathbb{Z}/p^n)/p$ is equal to $\frac{p^n-1}{p-1}$.
  Our proof combines the recent crystallinity result for reduced syntomic cohomology of Hahn, Levy and the second author with the explicit complex computing the syntomic cohomology of $\mathcal{O}_K /\varpi^n$ constructed by Antieau, Nikolaus and the first author.</description>

      <title>Weighted homology theory of orbifolds and Weighted Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06794v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new homology theories of orbifolds from some special type of triangulations adapted to orbifolds, called AW-homology and DW-homology. The main idea in the definitions of these two homology theories is that we use divisibly weighted simplices as building blocks of an orbifold and encode the orders of the local groups of the orbifold in the boundary maps of the chain complexes so that these two theories can reflect some information of the singular points. We prove that AW-homology and DW-homology are invariants of orbifolds under isomorphisms and more generally under certain type of homotopy equivalences of orbifolds. Moreover, we find that there exists a natural graded commutative product in the cohomology theory associated to DW-homology, which generalizes the cup product of the ordinary simplicial cohomology. In addition, we introduce a wider class of objects called weighted polyhedra and develop the whole theory of AW-homology and DW-homology in this wider setting. Our goal is to generalize the whole simplicial homology theory to all triangulizable topological spaces with a weight at each point where the weights are compatible with the triangulations in a certain sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin the study the algebraic topology of semi-coarse spaces, which are generalizations of coarse spaces that enable one to endow non-trivial `coarse-like' structures to compact metric spaces, something which is impossible in coarse geometry. We first study homotopy in this context, and we then construct homology groups which are invariant under semi-coarse homotopy equivalence. We further show that any undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ induces a semi-coarse structure on its set of vertices $V_G$, and that the respective semi-coarse homology is isomorphic to the Vietoris-Rips homology. This, in turn, leads to a homotopy invariance theorem for the Vietoris-Rips homology of undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Topological Quality of Subsets via Persistence Matching Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data quality is crucial for the successful training, generalization and performance of machine learning models. We propose to measure the quality of a subset concerning the dataset it represents, using topological data analysis techniques. Specifically, we define the persistence matching diagram, a topological invariant derived from combining embeddings with persistent homology. We provide an algorithm to compute it using minimum spanning trees. Also, the invariant allows us to understand whether the subset ``represents well" the clusters from the larger dataset or not, and we also use it to estimate bounds for the Hausdorff distance between the subset and the complete dataset. In particular, this approach enables us to explain why the chosen subset is likely to result in poor performance of a supervised learning model.</description>

Moreover, we prove that the rational ${\mathbb S}_n$-invariant cohomology of $\mathcal{MG}_{g,n}$ stabilizes for large $n$. That means, if $n \geq g \geq 2$, then there are isomorphisms $H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_n} \rightarrow H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n+1};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_{n+1}}$ for all $k$.</description>

Abstract: A permutohedral variety is a remarkable object in various areas of mathematics, and its topological invariants are widely recognized. However, only little is known about a real permutohedral variety, that is, the real locus of a permutohedral variety.
  The rational Betti numbers of real permutohedral varieties were computed in terms of alternating permutations in 2012. In this paper, we provide explicit descriptions of the cohomology ring of real permutohedral varieties. In particular, we describe the multiplicative structure in terms of alternating permutations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conner and Floyd determined the torsion in the special unitary bordism $\text{MSU}$ back in the late 1960s. One of the ingredients of their work was an interpolation between $\text{MSU}$ and unitary bordism $\text{MU}$. In this work, we prove an exactly similar relation between the special, and general linear algebraic cobordism $\text{MSL}$, and $\text{MGL}$ in the stable motivic homotopy category over any Noetherian base scheme of finite Krull dimension. This gives a filtration of $\text{MGL}$ in terms of $\text{MSL}$, and the skeletal filtration of $\mathbb{P}^{\infty}$. Using that, we compute the first slice of $\text{MSL}$ over characteristic zero fields. We also compute the first line of the stable homotopy groups of $\text{MSL}$ over fields of characteristic zero.</description>

Abstract: We show that in codimension at least 3, spaces of locally flat topological embeddings of manifolds are correctly modelled by derived spaces of maps between their configuration categories (under mild smoothability conditions). That general claim was reduced in an earlier paper to the special cases where the manifolds in question are euclidean spaces. We deal with these special cases by comparing to other special cases where the manifolds have the form "torus" and "torus times euclidean space" respectively, and by setting up a torus trick for configuration categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discover a connection between the Milnor fibration theory and current research trends in topological robotics. The configuration space and workspace are often described as subspaces of some Euclidean spaces. The work map is a continuous map which assigns to each state of the configuration space the position of the end-effector at that state. The tasking planning problem consists in study the complexity and design of algorithms controlling the task performed by the robot manipulator. We study the tasking planning problem for the Milnor fibration of analytic map germs. We see that the tasking planning algorithms strongly depend of the Milnor fibration theorem. We conjecture that the topological complexity of Milnor fibration coincides with the topological complexity of its base.</description>

Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of augmented $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the stabilization of the infinity category of augmented $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>
