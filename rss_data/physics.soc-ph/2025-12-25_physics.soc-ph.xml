      <title>Information-Backed Currency (IBC): Designing a Resilient, Transparent, and Information-Centric Monetary Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating digitization of economic activity has made information a dominant driver of market expectations, coordination, and systemic risk. Yet contemporary monetary systems remain anchored in architectures designed for material scarcity, institutional authority, or cryptographic constraint, leaving them increasingly misaligned with information-driven economies. This conceptual paper proposes Information-Backed Currency (IBC) as a monetary framework in which verified, high-integrity information functions as the primary source of value creation and monetary stability.
  Drawing on insights from econophysics, information theory, and cognitive economics, the paper advances the proposition that economic value emerges when information measurably reduces uncertainty within complex systems. Building on this premise, the study develops an architectural model in which currency issuance is linked to quantified entropy reduction achieved through multi-path information verification, reproducibility assessment, and contextual validation. An ethical governance layer, termed the Dharma Protocol, is introduced to ensure that only socially stabilizing, non-manipulative information qualifies as currency-backing input.
  The proposed IBC architecture comprises four interdependent layers: information ingestion, verification and validation, ethical oversight, and monetization through a Verification Value Unit tied to uncertainty reduction. While the framework is intentionally conceptual and non-empirical, it offers a coherent blueprint for re-imagining monetary governance in an era characterized by information abundance, cognitive constraints, and systemic fragility.</description>

      <title>How to Do STEM Outreach Evaluation -- Recommendations Based on a Review of Self Evaluation Tools in Canadian STEM Outreach Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) outreach programs in Canada, especially those oriented towards youth, play a critical role in supporting the nation's future workforce, innovation capacity, and equity across social groups in STEM fields. They constitute a large, multi-layered ecosystem connecting universities, national laboratories, non profit organizations, and grassroots community groups. Despite the growing importance of these programs, and the frequency that they undergo self-evaluation, little systematic information exists on best practices or common approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of STEM outreach initiatives. To address this gap, we integrated literature review with email inquiries about self evaluation tools sent to Canadian STEM outreach programs funded by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) PromoScience grants. We contacted 200 programs and heard back from about 100 of them, for a response rate of 50%. Of those respondents, 68 shared information about a formal self-evaluation tool appropriate for general STEM outreach. The results led us to develop a toolbox of self-evaluation methods, master question banks and starting-point templates for student/participant and teacher/chaperone surveys, and a synthesized list of recommendations for evaluation process, design, and implementation. Our approach provides a broad treatment of how to do STEM outreach evaluation, supplementing the relevant literature, where large-N studies and Canadian studies are relatively rare. We acknowledge that some of the most effective practices in STEM outreach evaluation require resources or capacity (e.g. longitudinal approaches), which may be limited for many outreach practitioners, but others seem to have a high ratio of benefit to cost (e.g. adding qualitative questions to an otherwise quantitative survey).</description>

      <title>Social learning moderates the tradeoffs between efficiency, stability, and equity in group foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective foragers, from animals to robotic swarms, must balance exploration and exploitation to locate sparse resources efficiently. While social learning is known to facilitate this balance, how the range of information sharing shapes group-level outcomes remains unclear. Here, we develop a minimal collective foraging model in which individuals combine independent exploration, local exploitation, and socially guided movement. We show that foraging efficiency is maximized at an intermediate social learning range, where groups exploit discovered resources without suppressing independent discovery. This optimal regime also minimizes temporal burstiness in resource intake, reducing starvation risk. Increasing social learning range further improves equity among individuals but degrades efficiency through redundant exploitation. Introducing risky (negative) targets shifts the optimal range upward; in contrast, when penalties are ignored, randomly distributed negative cues can further enhance efficiency by constraining unproductive exploration. Together, these results reveal how local information rules regulate a fundamental trade-off between efficiency, stability, and equity, providing design principles for biological foraging systems and engineered collectives.</description>
