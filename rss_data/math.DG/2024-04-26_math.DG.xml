      <title>Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove some Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds with nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. In particular, we give a sharp Willmore-like inequality in shrinking gradient Ricci solitons. These results can be regarded as generalizations of Agostiniani-Fogagnolo-Mazzieri's Willmore-type inequality in weighted manifolds. As applications, we derive some isoperimetric type inequalities under certain existence assumptions of isoperimetric regions in weighted manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Graphical Calculus for Stable Curvature Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we develop a graphical calculus for stable invariants of Riemannian manifolds akin to the graphical calculus for Rozansky-Witten invariants for hyperk\"ahler manifolds; based on interpreting trivalent graphs with colored edges as stably invariant polynomials on the space of algebraic curvature tensors. In this graphical calculus we describe explicitly the Pfaffian polynomials central to the Theorem of Chern-Gau{\ss}-Bonnet and the normalized moment polynomials calculating the moments of sectional curvature considered as a random variable on the Gra{\ss}mannian of planes. Eventually we illustrate the power of this graphical calculus by deriving a curvature identity for compact Einstein manifolds of dimensions greater than 2 involving the Euler characteristic, the third moment of sectional curvature and the $L^2$--norm of the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor. A model implementation of this calculus for the computer algebra system Maxima is available for download under http://www.matcuer.unam.mx/~gw/CurvGraphs.mac.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connection $A$ on a $SU(2)$-bundle $P$ over $\mathbb{R}^4$ with finite Yang-Mills energy $YM(A)$ and nonzero curvature $F_A(0)$ at the origin, and given $\rho&gt;0$ small enough, we construct a new connection $\hat A$ on a bundle $\hat P$ of different Chern class ($|c_2(A)-c_2(\hat A)|=8\pi^2$), in such a way that $\hat A$ is gauge equivalent to $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^4\setminus B_\rho(0)$ and $$YM(\hat A)\le YM(A)+8\pi^2-\varepsilon_0\rho^4|F_A(0)|^2$$ for a universal constant $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The tangent space in sub-Finsler geometry and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tangent space to a sub-Finsler manifold in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We prove that the metric tangent is described by the nilpotent approximation, generalizing the sub-Riemannian result. Additionally, we study the blow-up of a measure on a sub-Finsler manifold. We identify the new notion of bounded measure which ensures that, in the limit, the blow-up is a scalar multiple of the Lebesgue measure. Our results have applications in the study of the Lott-Sturm-Villani curvature-dimension condition in sub-Finsler manifolds. In particular, we show the failure of the CD condition in equiregular sub-Finsler manifolds with growth vector (2,3), equipped with a bounded measure.</description>

      <title>Conformal para quaternionic contact curvature and the local flatness theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tensor invariant is defined on a para quaternionic contact manifold in terms of the curvature and torsion of the canonical para quaternionic connection involving derivatives up to third order of the contact form. This tensor, called para quaternionic contact conformal curvature, is similar to the Weyl conformal curvature in Riemannian geometry, the Chern-Moser tensor in CR geometry, the para contact curvature in para CR geometry and to the quaternionic contact conformal curvature in quaternionic contact geometry.
  It is shown that a para quaternionic contact manifold is locally para quaternionic contact conformal to the standard flat para quaternionic contact structure on the para quaternionic Heisenberg group, or equivalently, to the standard para 3-Sasakian structure on the para quaternionic pseudo-sphere iff the para quaternionic contact conformal curvature vanishes.</description>

      <title>Geometry of paraquaternionic contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of paraquaternionic contact structures (pqc structures), which turns out to be a generalization of the para 3-Sasakian geometry. We derive a distinguished linear connection preserving the pqc structure. Its torsion tensor is expressed explicitly in terms of the structure tensors. We define pqc-Einstein manifolds and show that para 3-Sasakian spaces are precisely pqc manifolds, which are pqc-Einstein. We introduce the paraquaternionic Heisenberg qroup and show that it is the flat model of the pqc geometry.</description>

      <title>Rectifying submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds with anti-torqued axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study rectifying submanifolds of a Riemannian manifold endowed with an anti-torqued vector field. For this, we first determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the ambient space to admit such a vector field. Then we characterize submanifolds for which an anti-torqued vector field is always assumed to be tangent or normal. A similar characterization is also done in the case of the torqued vector fields. Finally, we obtain that the rectifying submanifolds with anti-torqued axis are the warped products whose warping function is a first integration of the conformal scalar of the axis.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spectral Problems for Collapsing Manifolds II: Quantitative Stability of Reconstruction for Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of determining the metric-measure structure of collapsing manifolds from local measurements of spectral data. In the part I of the paper, we proved the uniqueness of the inverse problem and a continuity result for the stability in the closure of Riemannian manifolds with bounded diameter and sectional curvature in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. In this paper we show that when the collapse of dimension is $1$-dimensional, it is possible to obtain quantitative stability of the inverse problem for Riemannian orbifolds. The proof is based on an improved version of the quantitative unique continuation for the wave operator on Riemannian manifolds by removing assumptions on the covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor.</description>

      <title>Volume growth on manifolds with more than one end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an open manifold $M$ and a function $v$ with bounded growth of derivative, there exists a Riemannian metric of bounded geometry on $M$ such that the volume growth function lies in the same growth class as $v$. This was proved by R. Grimaldi and P. Pansu with the proof focusing on the case of manifolds with a single end. We prove this in the case of manifolds with multiple ends and call the constructed metrics Grimaldi-Pansu metrics. We give uniform bounds for the volume growth function of these metrics in terms of the given bgd-function in the case of a certain class of manifolds which can be written as connected sums of a finite collection of closed and compact manifolds. We study the volume doubling condition and the Relatively Connected Annulus (R.C.A.) property of the Grimaldi-Pansu metrics, which play an important role in studying geometric analysis on manifolds with finitely many ends.</description>

      <title>Exploring new extrinsic upper bounds on the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator for compact submanifolds in Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upper bounds of the first non-trivial eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplace operator of a compact submanifold $M^n$ of Euclidean space $\R^{m+1}$, by means of a new technique, are obtained. Each of the upper bounds of $\lambda_1$ depends on the length of mean curvature vector field, the dimension $n$, the volume of $M^n$, and of a vector of $\R^{m+1}$. When $M^n$ does not lie minimally in a hypersphere of $\R^{m+1}$, classical Reilly's inequality \cite{Re} is improved and new upper bounds are explicitly computed. For instance, considering a torus of revolution whose generating circle has a radius of $1$ and is centered at distance $\sqrt{2}$ from the axis of revolution, we find $\lambda_1 &lt; \frac{4}{3}(\sqrt{2}-1)\approx 0.552284$, whereas Reilly's upper bound gives $\lambda_1 &lt; 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707106$.</description>

      <title>A differentiable monoid of smooth maps on Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.04816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate a monoid of smooth mappings on the space of arrows of a Lie groupoid and its group of units. The group of units turns out to be an infinite-dimensional Lie group which is regular in the sense of Milnor. Furthermore, this group is closely connected to the group of bisections of the Lie groupoid. Under suitable conditions, i.e. the source map of the Lie groupoid is proper, one also obtains a differentiable structure on the monoid and can identify the bisection group as a Lie subgroup of its group of units. Finally, relations between groupoids associated to the underlying Lie groupoid and subgroups of the monoid are obtained. The key tool driving the investigation is a generalisation of a result by A. Stacey which we establish in the present article. This result, called the Stacey-Roberts Lemma, asserts that pushforwards of submersions yield submersions between the infinite-dimensional manifolds of mappings.</description>

      <title>On second eigenvalues of closed hyperbolic surfaces for large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the second eigenvalues of closed hyperbolic surfaces for large genus. We show that for every closed hyperbolic surface $X_g$ of genus $g$ $(g\geq 3)$, up to uniform positive constants multiplications, the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(X_g)$ of $X_g$ is greater than $\frac{\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)}{g^2}$ and less than $\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)$; moreover these two bounds are optimal as $g\to \infty$. Here $\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)$ is the shortest length of simple closed multi-geodesics separating $X_g$ into three components.
  Furthermore, we also investigate the quantity $\frac{\lambda_2(X_g)}{\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)}$ for random hyperbolic surfaces of large genus. We show that as $g\to \infty$, a generic hyperbolic surface $X_g$ has $\frac{\lambda_2(X_g)}{\mathcal{L}_2(X_g)}$ uniformly comparable to $\frac{1}{\ln(g)}$.</description>

      <title>New examples of $2$-nondegenerate real hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^N$ with arbitrary nilpotent symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^N$, for $N&gt;3$, having a rank $1$ Levi kernel. The class is first of all remarkable by the fact that for every $N&gt;3$ it forms an {\em explicit} infinite-dimensional family of everywhere $2$-nondegenerate hypersurfaces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such construction. Besides, the class an infinite-dimensional family of non-equivalent structures having a given constant nilpotent CR symbol for every such symbol. Using methods that are able to handle all cases with $N&gt;5$ simultaneously, we solve the equivalence problem for the considered structures whose symbol is represented by a single Jordan block, classify their algebras of infinitesimal symmetries, and classify the locally homogeneous structures among them. We show that the remaining considered structures, which have symbols represented by a direct sum of Jordan blocks, can be constructed from the single block structures through simple linking and extension processes.</description>
