      <title>Fusion of two critical points and accelerated phase dynamics in orientational ternary mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by intracellular phase separation, we theoretically investigate how molecular orientation and multi-component nature affect phase behavior. We construct a minimal model for a ternary mixture composed of isotropic (I), anisotropic (A), and solvent (s) components by combining the Flory-Huggins and Maier-Saupe theories. We obtain two main results from evaluating the phase behavior and the time evolution of the density fields. First, for certain interaction parameters, two distinct binodal lines appear in the plane of the volume fractions of the I- and A-components, and merge through their respective critical points. Second, rapid droplet formation emerges due to a weakly first-order phase transition, characterized by a discontinuity of the spinodal surface. The first result indicates the possibility of continuous transformation between the two phase-separated states. The second result suggests that anisotropic molecules can regulate phase separation kinetics. These findings might be physically general beyond biological systems.</description>

      <title>Compliant Mechanisms for Invertible Poisson's Ratio and Tunable Stiffness in Cell Culture Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical environment of a substrate plays a key role in influencing the behavior of adherent biological cells. Traditional tunable substrates have limitations as their mechanical properties cannot be dynamically altered in-situ during cell culture. We present an alternate approach by using compliant mechanisms that enable realization of tunable substrate properties, specifically, invertible Poisson's ratio and tunable stiffness. These mechanisms transition between positive and negative Poisson's effects with tunable magnitude through a bistable Engaging-Disengaging Compliant Mechanism (EDCM). EDCM allows stiffness between two points of the substrate to switch between zero and theoretically infinite. In the stiffened state, lateral deformation reverses under a constant axial load, while in the zero-stiffness state, the deformation direction remains outward as that of re-entrant structure. EDCM in conjunction with an offset mechanism also allows tuning of the effective stiffness of the entire mechanism. We present analytical models correlating geometric parameters to displacement ratios in both bistable states and through illustrative design cases, demonstrate their potential for designing dynamic and reconfigurable cell culture substrates.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Correlations in Aqueous Alkylamine Mixtures Between Molecular and Micro Emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how molecular correlations give rise to mesoscale organization is central to the physics of complex fluids such as hydrogen-bonded mixtures. In this work, we develop a mesoscale bridge formalism that connects the site-site Ornstein-Zernike (SSOZ) framework to the field theoretical Teubner-Strey (TS) approach. This bridge highlights how local orientational correlations, typically lost in the SSOZ closure, reemerge as effective long-range components at the mesoscale. The resulting theory provides a unified description of density fluctuations spanning molecular to mesoscopic length scales. The approach is illustrated using X-ray scattering spectra from simulated and experimental hydrogen-bonded fluids, showing that the TS representation captures the essential features of the mesoscale structure. Beyond this specific application, the proposed formalism offers a general route to interpret the structural crossover between microscopic interactions and collective mesoscale organization in complex fluids, including aqueous and amphiphilic systems.</description>

      <title>Persistently Non-Gaussian Metastable Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles undergoing Fickian diffusion within smooth energy landscapes exhibit Gaussian statistics. However, this Gaussian behavior is often elusive in complex liquids, where particle dynamics within spontaneously fluctuating or spatio-temporally heterogeneous environments lead to a breakdown of ergodicity and time-reversal symmetry. This is usually caused by extreme particle movements or sudden dynamical arrest. Such situations are prevalent in dense metastable liquids exhibiting slow flow or cooperative movements, facilitated by cage-breaking. We investigate the dynamics of glassy systems driven by either thermal, external, or environmental fluctuations. Despite their differences, our findings reveal that particle motion is universally affected by large deviations, resulting in non-Gaussian tails persisting over multiple decades in time. We further discuss the underlying dynamical aspects.</description>

      <title>On the decay of spatial correlations in the Tonks gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an alternative derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the radial distribution function $g(r)$ for the one-dimensional Tonks gas at high packing fractions, recently analyzed by Bouzar and Messina [Phys. Rev. E 112, L042105 (2025)]. Our approach is based on the Laplace representation of $g(r)$ and pole analysis. By identifying the poles and residues of the Laplace transform in the limit of small void fraction, we obtain an exact representation of $g(r)$ in terms of the Jacobi elliptic theta function $\theta_3$. This representation is shown to be essentially equivalent to the Gaussian superposition found by Bouzar and Messina through the Poisson summation formula, but offers a more compact form that naturally reveals the two asymptotic regimes governing the oscillatory decay toward unity: an algebraic decay at intermediate distances and an exponential decay at large distances. Our method complements the original analysis by connecting the spatial oscillations directly to the pole structure in Laplace space.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced collective motion in suspensions of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective motion is ubiquitous in active systems at all length and time scales. The mechanisms behind such collective motion usually are alignment interactions between active particles, effective alignment after collisions between agents or symmetry-breaking fluctuations induced by passive species in active suspensions. In this article, we introduce a new type of collective motion in the shape of a traveling band induced purely by confinement, where no explicit or effective alignment are prescribed among active agents. We study a suspension of run-and-tumble particles confined in microchannels comprising asymmetric boundaries: one flat wall and one array of funnel-like obstacles. We study the phase behavior of the confined active suspension upon changes in the packing fraction and the persistence length to define the stability region of the traveling band. We characterize the traveling band structurally and dynamically and study its stability with respect to the tilt angle of the obstacles. Lastly, we describe the mechanism of motion of the band, which resembles the tracked locomotion of some heavy vehicles like tractors, finding that a counter-flux of active particles in the lower part of the band, explained in terms of source-sink and vacancy diffusion mechanisms, is the facilitator of the traveling band and sustains its motion. We name this new collective phenomenon confinement-induced tracked locomotion</description>

      <title>(Dis-)appearance of liquid-liquid phase transitions in a heterogeneous activated patchy particle model and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion-activated patchy particle model is an important theoretical framework to investigate the phase be- haviour of globular proteins in the presence of multivalent ions. In this work, we study and highlight the influence of patch heterogeneity on the extension, appearance and disappearance of the liquid-liquid coexis- tence region of the phase diagram. We demonstrate that within this model the binding energy between salt ions and patches of different type is a key factor in determining the phase behavior. Specifically, we show under which conditions liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in these systems can appear or disappear for varying binding energy and ion-mediated attraction energy between ion-occupied and unoccupied patches. In particular we address the influence of the patch type dependence of these energies on the (dis)appearance of LLPS. These results rationalize our new results on ion-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation in solutions of bovine serum albumine with trivalent cations. In comparison with models with non-activated patches, where the gas-liquid transition disappears when the number of patches approaches two, we find the complementary mechanism that ions may shift the attractions from stronger to weaker patches (with an accompanying disappearance of the transition), if their binding energy to the patches changes. The results have implications for the understanding of charge-driven LLPS in biological systems and its suppression.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the three-phase coexistence line of the ethane hydrate from molecular simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-phase coexistence line of ethane (C$_2$H$_6$) hydrate through molecular dynamics simulations using the direct coexistence approach. In this framework, C$_2$H$_6$ sI hydrate, aqueous, and pure guest phases are constructed within a single simulation box, allowing us to monitor their mutual stability. From the temporal evolution of the potential energy, we identify the equilibrium temperature (T$_3$) at which all three phases coexist, across pressures ranging from 1000 to 4000 bar, in accordance with available experimental data. Simulations are performed with the GROMACS package (version 2016, double precision) in the $NPT$ ensemble. Water and C$_2$H$_6$ molecules are represented using the TIP4P/Ice and TraPPE-UA models, respectively, while unlike non-bonded interactions are computed with the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule. Dispersive Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions are truncated at 1.6 nm, with long-range Coulombic contributions treated via Particle-Mesh Ewald summation. The predicted three-phase coexistence line shows excellent agreement with experimental measurements within the investigated pressure range. These results demonstrate the suitability of the direct coexistence methodology, combined with established molecular models, for reproducing hydrate dissociation behavior in systems that have received little prior computational attention.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Dynamics of Roughness-Driven Flow in Soft Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft lubricated contacts exhibit complex interfacial behaviours governed by the coupled effects of multiscale surface roughness and non-linear fluid-solid interactions. Accurately capturing this interplay across thin-film flows is challenging due to the strong synergy between contact mechanics and hydrodynamic flow, spanning over various spatiotemporal scales. Here, we develop a rigorous computational framework to simulate the frictional behaviour of soft lubricated interfaces; its modularity and the use of optimal solvers provides solutions for realistic configurations in lubrication regimes ranging from direct solid contact to complete fluid separation. Surface roughness is described via Persson's statistical theory as well as a deterministic Conjugate Gradient with Fast Fourier Transform (CG-FFT) approach, while limitations associated with classical half-space models are addressed by developing the Reduced Stiffness Method (RSM) to rigorously model pressure-induced surface responses. The integrated framework captures the full evolution of frictional behaviour, validated against experiments on rough elastomer-glass interfaces, revealing how surface roughness and material compliance together drive the transition from solid contact to fluid-mediated sliding. The developed approach establishes a robust and versatile simulation tool for analysing a plethora of soft interfacial systems shaped by fluid-solid interactions, with potential applications including but not limited to biomechanics, soft robotics and microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviour and dynamical features of a two-dimensional binary mixture of active/passive spherical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we have characterized the phase behaviour and the dynamics of bidimensional mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles. We have evaluated state diagrams at several concentrations of the passive components finding that, while passive agents tend to hinder phase separation, active agents force crystal-like structures on passive colloids. In order to study how passive particles affect the dynamics of the mixture, we have computed the long-time diffusion coefficient of each species, concluding that active particles induce activity and super-diffusive behaviour on passive ones. Interestingly, at the density at which the system enters a MIPS state the active particles' diffusivity shows an inflection point and the passive particles' one goes through a maximum, due to the change in the dynamics of the active components, as shown in the displacement's probability distribution function.</description>

      <title>The Role of Elastic Anisotropy in Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the effect of anisotropy in elastic constants on the hydrodynamics of active nematics. Building on the multipole framework for a single elastic constant, we determine the leading effect of elastic anisotropy on the active response of generic distortions. The key findings are a new active torque, proportional to the anisotropy, in response to monopole distortions, and modifications to the propulsion of dipoles in both the direction of motion and changes in speed of up to 50\%. For point defects in two dimensions we find that, despite the large morphological changes in the director field, elastic anisotropy has only a minor impact on their hydrodynamics, with the self-propulsion speed of $+1/2$ defects lowered by less than 5\%. Finally, we determine the elastic torques exerted on defect pairs due to elastic anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The values of liquid odd-viscosity coefficients remain largely unknown, with only a single experimental measurement reported to date [Nature Physics 15, 1188 (2019)]. In this work, inspired by the well-known consequences of dispersion surfaces in classical liquids from the work of Lighthill, we theoretically determine the shapes of constant-phase wave crests formed around obstacles moving at constant velocity in two- and three-dimensional odd viscous liquids, which may or may not undergo rigid rotation. From this analysis, we derive parametric relations that the odd-viscosity coefficients must satisfy, providing a framework for their experimental determination.</description>

      <title>Soap Film Drainage Under Tunable Gravity Using a Centrifugal Thin Film Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8 - 0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological information of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom setup comparable to commercial printers. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. We complement the experiments with computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow inside the printing nozzle, incorporating filament melting through an enthalpy-porosity formulation and treating the air-polymer melt interface using a two-phase approach. The simulated velocity profiles agree closely with the XPTV measurements across the investigated operating conditions, supporting the experimental interpretation. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this is the first application of XPTV to polymer melt rheology. It enables measurements that are inaccessible to conventional optical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--H\"uckel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Deterministic optimization algorithms unequivocally partition a complex energy landscape in inherent structures (ISs) and their respective basins of attraction. Can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is paramount to understanding hard sphere jamming, a key model of disordered matter. We here address the issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent-like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting ISs is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs, which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class. Along the way, the physical origin of a dynamical Gardner transition is identified.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated noise, characterized by a single length scale, and constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation--dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length \(\ell\) and the correlation strength \(\beta\). Intuitively, increasing \(\ell\) enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, because a larger correlation length slows viscous momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing \(\beta\) also increases the MSD, because a weaker correlation strength decelerates fluid momentum diffusion. Thus, the emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from the competition between momentum correlation and viscous dissipation. We further show that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equation, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>
