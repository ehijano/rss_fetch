      <title>Nijenhuis-Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Lie bialgebra analogs of Poisson-Nijenhuis structures and introduce the notion of (weak)Nijenhuis-Lie bialgebra, a Lie bialgebra with a Nijenhuis structure on a Lie algebra satisfying compatibility conditions. We show that a Nijenhuis-Lie bialgebra gives rise to a hierarchy of compatible Lie bialgebras on the initial Lie algebra and deformed Lie algebras by means of the Nijenhuis structure of any order. We show that the underlying algebraic structure of Euler-top system is a weak Nijenhuis-Lie bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flatness and E. Hopf's theorem for magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the notion of magnetic curvature recently introduced by the first author, we extend E. Hopf's theorem to the setting of magnetic systems. Namely, we prove that if the magnetic flow on the s-sphere bundle is without conjugate points, then the total magnetic curvature is non-positive, and vanishes if and only if the magnetic system is magnetically flat. We then prove that magnetic flatness is a rigid condition, in the sense that it only occurs when either the magnetic form is trivial and the metric is flat, or when the magnetic system is K\"ahler, the metric has constant negative sectional holomorphic curvature, and s equals the Ma\~n\'e critical value.</description>

      <title>The structure of locally conformally product Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A locally conformally product (LCP) structure on a compact conformal manifold is a closed non-exact Weyl connection (i.e.~a linear connection which is locally but not globally the Levi-Civita connection of Riemannian metrics in the conformal class), with reducible holonomy. A left-invariant LCP structure on a compact quotient $\Gamma\backslash G$ of a simply connected Riemannian Lie group $(G,g)$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ can be characterized in terms of a closed 1-form $\theta\in\mathfrak{g}^*$ and a non-zero subspace $\mathfrak{u}\subset \mathfrak{g}$ satisfying some algebraic conditions. We show that these conditions are equivalent to the fact that $\mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to a semidirect product of a non-unimodular Lie algebra acting on an abelian one by a conformal representation. This extends to the general case previous results holding for solvmanifolds. In addition, we construct explicit examples of compact LCP manifolds which are not solvmanifolds.</description>

      <title>A support preserving homotopy for the de Rham complex with boundary decay estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the de Rham complex of relative differential forms on compact manifolds with boundary. Chain homotopies for this complex are highly non-unique, and different homotopies can have different analytic properties, particularly near the boundary. We construct a chain homotopy that has desirable support propagation properties, and that satisfies estimates relative to weighted Sobolev norms, where the weights measure decay at the boundary. The estimates are optimal given the homogeneity properties of the de Rham differential under boundary dilation, and are obtained by showing that the homotopy is a b-pseudodifferential operator. As a corollary we obtain a right inverse of the divergence operator on Euclidean space that preserves support on large balls around the origin, and satisfies estimates that measure decay at infinity. Such a support preserving right inverse was constructed before by Bogovskii, but its mapping properties are not optimal with respect to decay.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian symmetric critical gravitating vortices on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce examples of solutions to the non-abelian gravitating vortex equations, which are a dimensional reduction of the K\"aher-Yang-Mills- Higgs equations. These are equations for a K\"ahler metric and a metric on a vector bundle. We consider a symmetric situation on a sphere with a relationship between the parameters involved (criticality), and perform a non-trivial reduction of the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations on the real line with complicated boundary conditions at infinity. This system involves a parameter whose dependence on the volume of the K\"ahler metric is non-explicit. We prove existence to this system using the method of continuity. We then prove that the parameter can be varied to make sure that all possible admissible volumes are attained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a strong generalized holomorphic (SGH) fiber bundle and develop connection and curvature theory for an SGH principal $G$-bundle over a regular generalized complex (GC) manifold, where $G$ is a complex Lie group. We develop a de Rham cohomology for regular GC manifolds, and a Dolbeault cohomology for SGH vector bundles. Moreover, we establish a Chern-Weil theory for SGH principal $G$-bundles under certain mild assumptions on the leaf space of the GC structure. We also present a Hodge theory along with associated dualities and vanishing theorems for SGH vector bundles. Several examples of SGH fiber bundles are given.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g^{TM})$ be an odd dimensional ($\dim M\geq 3$) connected oriented noncompact complete spin Riemannian manifold. Let $k^{TM}$ be the associated scalar curvature. Let $f:M\to S^{\dim M}(1)$ be a smooth area decreasing map which is locally constant near infinity and of nonzero degree. Suppose $k^{TM}\geq ({\dim M})({\dim M}-1)$ on the support of ${\rm d}f$, we show that $\inf(k^{TM})&lt;0$. This answers a question of Gromov.</description>

      <title>Some Computational Results on Koszul-Vinberg Cochain Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An affine connection is said to be flat if its curvature tensor vanishes identically. Koszul-Vinberg (KV for abbreviation) cohomology has been invoked to study the deformation theory of flat and torsion-free affine connections on tangent bundle. In this Note, we compute explicitly the differentials of various specific KV cochains, and study their relation to classical objects in information geometry, including deformations associated with projective and dual-projective transformations of a flat and torsion-free affine connection. As an application, we also give a simple yet non-trivial example of a KV algebra of which second cohomology group does not vanish.</description>

      <title>No compact split limit Ricci flow of type II from the blow-down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By Perelman's $\mathcal L$-geodesic theory, we study the blow-down solutions on a noncompact $\kappa$-noncollapsed steady gradient Ricci soliton $(M^n, g)$ $(n\ge 4)$ with nonnegative curvature operator and positive Ricci curvature away from a compact set of $M$. We prove that any $(n-1)$-dimensional compact split ancient solution from the blow-down of $(M, g)$ is of type I. The result is a generalization of our previous work from $n=4$ to any dimension.</description>

      <title>Classification of Affinely Homogeneous Hessian Rank 2 Hypersurfaces S^3 in R^4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine all affinely homogeneous hypersurfaces S^3 in R^4 whose Hessian is (invariantly) of constant rank 2, including the simply transitive ones.
  We find 34 inequivalent terminal branches yielding each to a nonempty moduli space of homogeneous models of hypersurfaces S^3 in R^4, sometimes parametrized by a certain complicated algebraic variety, especially for the 15 (over 34) families of models which are simply transitive.
  We employ the power series method of equivalence, which captures invariants at the origin, creates branches, and infinitesimalizes calculations.
  In Lie's original classification spirit, we describe the found homogeneous models by listing explicit Lie algebras of infinitesimal transformations, sometimes parametrized by absolute invariants satisfying certain algebraic equations.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler Soliton Surfaces Are Generically Toric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g, \omega, f, \lambda)$ be a K\"{a}hler gradient Ricci soliton in real dimension four. The first theorem states that it is an integrable Hamiltonian system in a classical sense. Furthermore, it is either of cohomogeneity one or the integrals of motion are given by the potential function $f$ and the scalar curvature $\text{S}$. The second theorem states that it must be toric under a generic assumption. That is, one assumes that the system is non-degenerate and the potential function $f$ is proper. In case $\lambda=0$, one further assumes that $f$ is bounded below or above. Then there is an effective, completely integrable Hamiltonian toric $\mathbb{T}^2$- action on $(M, \omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of Hermitian holomorphic line bundles $(L_k,h_k)$ over a complex manifold $M$ which may not be compact, we generalize the scaling method in arXiv:2310.08048 to study the asymptotic behavior of the Bergman kernels and spectral kernels with respect to the space of global holomorphic sections of $L_k$ with $(0,q)$-forms. We derive the leading term of the Bergman and spectral kernels under the local convergence assumption in the sequence of Chern curvatures $c_1(L_k,h_k)$, inspired by arXiv:2012.12019. The manifold $M$ may be non-K\"ahler and $c_1(L_k,h_k)$ may be negative or degenerate. Moreover, we establish the $L_k$-asymptotic version of Demailly's holomorphic Morse inequalities as an application to compact complex manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem of harmonic measures was first studied by Jerison \cite{JER1991}. Recently, Akman and Mukherjee \cite{AKM2023} studied the Minkowski problem corresponding to $p$-harmonic measures on convex domains and generalized Jerison's results. In this paper, we obtain the existence of the smooth solution of the $p$-harmonic measure Minkowski problem by method of the Gauss curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Symmetry defect of $n$-dimensional complete intersections in $\mathbb{C}^{2n-1}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X, Y \subset \mathbb{C}^{2n-1}$ be $n$-dimensional strong complete intersections in a general position. In this note, we consider the set of midpoints of chords connecting a point $x \in X$ to a point $y \in Y$. This set is defined as the image of the map $\Phi(x,y)=\frac{x+y}{2}.$ Under geometric conditions on $X$ and $Y$, we prove that the symmetry defect of $X$ and $Y$, which is the bifurcation set $B(X,Y)$ of the mapping $\Phi$, is an algebraic variety, characterized by a topological invariant. We introduce a hypersurface that approximates the set $B(X,Y)$ and we present an estimate for its degree. Moreover, for any two $n$-dimensional strong complete intersections $X,Y\subset \mathbb{C}^{2n-1}$ (including the case $X=Y$) we introduce a generic symmetry defect set $\tilde{B}(X,Y)$ of $X$ and $Y$, which is defined up to homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Twisted K\"ahler-Einstein metrics in big classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08324v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence of twisted K\"ahler-Einstein metrics in big cohomology classes, using a divisorial stability condition. In particular, when $-K_X$ is big, we obtain a uniform Yau-Tian-Donaldson existence theorem for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics. To achieve this, we build up from scratch the theory of Fujita-Odaka type delta invariants in the transcendental big setting, using pluripotential theory. We do not use the K-energy in our arguments, and our techniques provide a simple roadmap to prove Yau-Tian-Donaldson existence theorems for K\"ahler-Einstein type metrics, that only needs convexity of the appropriate Ding energy. As an application, we give a simplified proof of Li-Tian-Wang's existence theorem in the log Fano setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $\Theta$-positivity in real simple Lie groups. This notion at the same time generalizes Lusztig's total positivity in split real Lie groups and invariant orders in Lie groups of Hermitian type. We show that there are four families of Lie groups which admit $\Theta$-positive structures, and investigate basic properties of $\Theta$-positivity.</description>

      <title>A Kodaira type conjecture on almost complex 4 manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14690v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Not long ago, Cirici and Wilson defined a Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds to answer Hirzebruch's problem. In this paper, we define a refined Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds. We show that the condition $\tilde h^{1,0}=\tilde h^{0,1}$ implies a symplectic structure on a compact almost complex $4$ manifold, where $\tilde h^{1,0}$ and $\tilde h^{0,1}$ are the dimensions of the refined Dolbeault cohomology groups with bi-degrees $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ respectively. Combining the partial answer to Donaldson's tameness conjecture, we offer a sufficient condition for a compact almost complex $4$ manifold to become an almost K\"ahler one.
  Moreover, we prove that the condition $\tilde{h}^{1,0}=\tilde h^{0,1}$ is equivalent to the generalized $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. This can be regarded as an analogue of the Kodaira's conjecture on almost complex $4$ manifolds. As an application, we show that the Kodaira-Thurston manifold satisfies the $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. Meanwhile, we show that the Fr\"olicher-type equality does not hold on a general almost complex $4$ manifold, which is different to the case of compact complex surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Petrov Type of a 4-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On an oriented 4-manifold, we examine the geometry that arises when the curvature operator of a Riemannian or Lorentzian metric $g$ commutes, not with its own Hodge star operator, but rather with that of another semi-Riemannian metric $h$ that is a suitable deformation of $g$. We classify the case when one of these metrics is Riemannian and the other Lorentzian by generalizing the concept of Petrov Type from general relativity; the case when $h$ is split-signature is also examined. The "generalized Petrov Types" so obtained are shown to relate to the critical points of $g$'s sectional curvature, and sometimes yield unique normal forms. They also carry topological information independent of the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality, and yield a direct geometric formulation of "almost-Einsten" metric via the Ricci or sectional curvature of $g$.</description>

      <title>On homogeneous plane waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plane waves are a special class of Lorentzian spaces with a parallel null vector field. They are of great importance in Geometry (e.g. Lorentzian holonomy) and in Physics (General Relativity as well as alternative gravity theories). Our contribution in the present paper aims at a rigorous mathematical treatment focusing on completeness of Killing fields, and globality of coordinates. Equivalence of different approaches to plane waves is by no means easy to handle. We use here cohomogeneity one Heisenberg actions to introduce a point of view from which one can see plane waves as a deformation of Minkowski spacetime. We determine the identity component of the isometry group of a 1-connected non-flat homogeneous plane wave, which establishes a correspondence between these spaces and certain 1-parameter groups of automorphisms of the Heisenberg group. The extendibility of spacetimes (when incomplete) is a natural, important and delicate question. One of our main results is the proof of the $C^2$-inextendibility of non-flat homogeneous plane waves. We also prove that they are geodesically complete if and only if the null parallel vector field is preserved by the identity component of the isometry group. Finally, we show that a 1-connected homogeneous plane wave admits global Brinkmann coordinates.</description>

      <title>The Non-Abelian X-Ray Transform on Asymptotically Hyperbolic Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we formulate and prove a gauge equivalence for connections and Higgs fields of suitable regularity that are mapped to the same function under the non-abelian X-ray transform on nontrapping asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) spaces with negative curvature and no nontrivial twisted conformal Killing tensor fields with certain regularity. If one furthermore fixes such a connection with zero curvature, a corollary provides an injectivity result for the non-abelian X-ray transform over Higgs fields.</description>

      <title>Rigidity aspects of Penrose's singularity theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rigidity aspects of Penrose's singularity theorem. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: if a spacetime satisfies the hypotheses of Penrose's singularity theorem except with weakly trapped surfaces instead of trapped surfaces, then what can be said about the global spacetime structure if the spacetime is null geodesically complete? In this setting, we show that we obtain a foliation of MOTS which generate totally geodesic null hypersurfaces. Depending on our starting assumptions, we obtain either local or global rigidity results. We apply our arguments to cosmological spacetimes (i.e., spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces) and scenarios involving topological censorship.</description>

      <title>Regularities for solutions to the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets in a pointed closed convex cone was proposed and a weak solution to this problem was provided. In smooth setting, this problem is equivalent to solving the Dirichlet problem for a class of Monge-Amp\`ere type equations. In this paper, we show the existence, regularity and uniqueness of solutions to this Monge-Amp\`ere type equation in the case $p\geq 1$ by studying variational properties for a family of Monge-Amp\`ere functionals. Moreover, the existence and optimal global H\"older regularity in the case $p&lt;1$ and $q\geq n$ is also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Integration of first-order ODEs by Jacobi fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of vector fields enabling the integration of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced. These vector fields are not, in general, Lie point symmetries. The results are based on a relation between 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and the integrability of first-order ODEs, which was established in a previous work of the authors. An integration procedure is provided, together with several examples to illustrate it. A connection between integrating factors of first-order ODEs and Schr\"odinger-type equations is highlighted.</description>
