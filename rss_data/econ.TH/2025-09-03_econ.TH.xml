      <title>Convex Cost of Information via Statistical Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes convex information costs using an axiomatic approach. We employ mixture convexity and sub-additivity, which capture the idea that producing "balanced" outputs is less costly than producing ``extreme'' ones. Our analysis leads to a novel class of cost functions that can be expressed in terms of R\'enyi divergences between signal distributions across states. This representation allows for deviations from the standard posterior-separable cost, thereby accommodating recent experimental evidence. We also characterize two simpler special cases, which can be written as either the maximum or a convex transformation of posterior-separable costs.</description>

      <title>Herding Prices: Social Learning and Dynamic Competition in Duopoly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed observational learning (BHW) in a symmetric duopoly with random arrivals and search frictions. With fixed posted prices, a mixed-strategy pricing equilibrium exists and yields price dispersion even with ex-ante identical firms. We provide closed-form cascade bands and show wrong cascades occur with positive probability for interior parameters, vanishing as signals become precise or search costs fall; absorption probabilities are invariant to the arrival rate. In equilibrium, the support of mixed prices is connected and overlapping; its width shrinks with signal precision and expands with search costs, and mean prices comove accordingly. Under Calvo price resets (Poisson opportunities), stationary dispersion and mean prices fall; when signals are sufficiently informative, wrong-cascade risk also declines. On welfare, a state-contingent Pigouvian search subsidy implements the planner's cutoff. Prominence (biased first visits) softens competition and depresses welfare; neutral prominence is ex-ante optimal.</description>

      <title>Social Learning from Experts with Uncertain Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study social learning from multiple experts whose precision is unknown and who care about reputation. The observer both learns a persistent state and ranks experts. In a binary baseline we characterize per-period equilibria: high types are truthful; low types distort one-sidedly with closed-form mixing around the prior. Aggregation is additive in log-likelihood ratios. Light-touch design -- evaluation windows scored by strictly proper rules or small convex deviation costs -- restores strict informativeness and delivers asymptotic efficiency under design (consistent state learning and reputation identification). A Gaussian extension yields a mimicry coefficient and linear filtering. With common shocks, GLS weights are optimal and correlation slows learning. The framework fits advisory panels, policy committees, and forecasting platforms, and yields transparent comparative statics and testable implications.</description>

      <title>Self-Employment as a Signal: Career Concerns with Hidden Firm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a dynamic labor market in which a worker with career concerns chooses each period between (i) self-employment that makes output publicly observable and (ii) employment at a firm that pays a flat wage but keeps individual performance hidden from outside observers. Output is binary and the worker is risk averse. The worker values future opportunities through a reputation for talent; firms may be benchmark (myopic) (ignoring the informational content of an application) or equilibrium (updating beliefs from the very act of applying). Three forces shape equilibrium: an insurance - information trade-off, selection by reputation, and inference from application decisions. We show that (i) an absorbing employment region exists in which low-reputation workers strictly prefer the firm's insurance and optimally cease producing public information; (ii) sufficiently strong reputation triggers self-employment in order to generate public signals and preserve future outside options; and (iii) with equilibrium firms, application choices act as signals that shift hiring thresholds and wages even when in-firm performance remains opaque. Comparative statics deliver sharp, testable predictions for the prevalence of self-employment, the cyclicality of switching, and wage dynamics across markets with different degrees of performance transparency. The framework links classic career-concerns models to contemporary environments in which some tasks generate portable, public histories while firm tasks remain unobserved by the outside market (e.g., open-source contributions, freelancing platforms, or sales roles with standardized public metrics). Our results rationalize recent empirical findings on the value of public performance records and illuminate when opacity inside firms dampens or amplifies reputational incentives.</description>

      <title>Monotone Perfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of perfect monotone equilibrium in Bayesian games, which refines the standard monotone equilibrium by accounting for the possibility of unintended moves (trembling hand) and thereby enhancing robustness to small mistakes. We construct two counterexamples to demonstrate that the commonly used conditions in Athey (2001), McAdams (2003) and Reny (2011) - specifically, the single crossing condition and quasi-supermodularity - are insufficient to guarantee the existence of a perfect monotone equilibrium. Instead, we establish that the stronger conditions of increasing differences and supermodularity are required to ensure equilibrium existence. To illustrate the practical relevance of our findings, we apply our main results to multiunit auctions and further extend the analysis to first-price auctions, all-pay auctions, and Bertrand competitions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study belief polarization among Bayesian agents observing public information about a multidimensional state. Baliga et al. (2013) show that divergence in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance is impossible for one dimensional beliefs, but we find that in multidimensional settings it can occur for all marginal beliefs, even with infinitely many signals. At the same time, we extend their impossibility result: divergence in the sense of multidimensional stochastic dominance is impossible. For an intermediate stochastic order, polarization may arise only in the short-run. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on signal structures for persistent polarization and discuss implications for polarization in actions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically stable revision and comparative probability: a representation theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures categorical belief in terms of $\textit{probabilistically stable propositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high credence. The stability rule generates a class of $\textit{probabilistically stable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that result from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning while complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In this paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete characterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and provides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic) logic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a selection function to be representable as a strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability orders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio comparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than event $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point out two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games and to revealed preference theory.</description>

      <title>Public Good Provision with a Governor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a public good game with N citizens and a Governor who allocates resources from a common fund. Citizens may voluntarily contribute or be compelled to do so if audited, in which case shirkers face a penalty. The Governor decides how much of the fund to devote to public good provision, with the remainder embezzled. Crucially, the Governor's utility combines material payoffs from embezzlement with belief-dependent reputational concerns. We fully characterize the symmetric subgame perfect equilibria (SSPE) of the game. The model always admits at least one pure-strategy equilibrium, ranging from universal free-riding with complete embezzlement to full contribution with efficient provision. Mixed-strategy equilibria exist only in a narrow region of parameter values and may involve multiple equilibria. Our analysis highlights the roles of penalties, audits, and reputational incentives in sustaining contribution and provision, thereby linking public good provision with the broader literature on corruption, embezzlement, and psychological game theory.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Charitable Donations with Leontief Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of funding public goods that are complementary in nature. Examples include charities handling different needs (e.g., protecting animals vs. providing healthcare), charitable donations to different individuals, or municipal units handling different issues (e.g., security vs. transportation). We model these complementarities by assuming Leontief preferences; that is, each donor seeks to maximize an individually weighted minimum of all contributions across the charities. Decentralized funding may be inefficient due to a lack of coordination among the donors; centralized funding may be undesirable as it ignores the preferences of individual donors. We present a mechanism that combines the advantages of both methods. The mechanism efficiently distributes each donor's contribution so that no subset of donors has an incentive to redistribute their donations. Moreover, it is group-strategyproof, satisfies desirable monotonicity properties, maximizes Nash welfare, returns a unique Lindahl equilibrium, and can be implemented via natural best-response spending dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rational Bubbles Attached to Real Assets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational bubble is a situation in which the asset price exceeds its fundamental value defined by the present discounted value of dividends in a rational equilibrium model. We discuss the recent development of the theory of rational bubbles attached to real assets, emphasizing the following three points. (i) There exist plausible economic models in which bubbles inevitably emerge in the sense that all equilibria are bubbly. (ii) Such models are necessarily nonstationary but their long-run behavior can be analyzed using the local stable manifold theorem. (iii) Bubbles attached to real assets can naturally and necessarily arise with economic development. We illustrate these three points in various settings attesting that bubbles may necessarily emerge for aggregate stocks, land, and other assets.</description>

Abstract: A multi-product monopolist faces a buyer who is privately informed about his valuations for the goods. As is well-known, optimal mechanisms are in general complicated, while simple mechanisms -- such as pure bundling or separate sales -- can be far from optimal and do not admit clear-cut comparisons. We show that this changes if the monopolist has sufficiently precise information about the buyer's valuations: Now, pure bundling always outperforms separate sales; moreover, there is a sense in which pure bundling performs essentially as well as the optimal mechanism. To formalize this, we characterize how fast the corresponding revenues converge to the first-best revenue as the monopolist's information grows precise: Pure bundling achieves the same convergence rate to the first-best as optimal mechanisms; in contrast, the convergence rate under separate sales is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Does Ideological Polarization Lead to Policy Polarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I analyze an election involving two parties who are both office- and policy-motivated and who are ideologically polarized. One party may possess a valence advantage. The parties compete by proposing policies on a second policy issue. The analysis reveals a subtle relationship between ideological polarization and policy polarization. If ideologies are highly dispersed, there is a U-shaped relationship between ideological polarization and platform polarization. In contrast, if ideological dispersion is limited, increasing ideological polarization generally results in policy moderation. In both cases, valence plays no role in policy polarization. Finally, as in Buisseret and van Weelden (2022), adding ideological polarization adds nuance on the effects of increasing valence: both high- and low-valence candidates may adopt more extreme positions, depending on the electorate's degree of ideological polarization.</description>

      <title>False Cascades and the Cost of Truth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential social learning when agents can sometimes pay to verify a claim and obtain hard, publicly checkable evidence. Each agent observes the public history, receives a private signal, may investigate at a cost (succeeding only when the claim is true), and can disclose or conceal any proof. Actions are binary or continuous, with a conformity pull toward the prevailing consensus. We characterize when false cascades persist and when societies self-correct. In the binary benchmark, we derive an investigation cutoff and show how its location relative to classic cascade bands governs breakability; a simple knife-edge condition guarantees that any wrong cascade at the boundary is overturned with positive probability. With continuous actions, coarse observation and conformity can recreate cascades, yet occasional disclosures collapse them. These forces yield a tractable "resilience frontier" with transparent comparative statics and policy levers.</description>

      <title>Contrarian Motives in Social Learning: Information Cascades with Nonconformist Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embed a taste for nonconformism into a canonical Bikhchandani-Hirshleifer-Welch social-learning model. Agents value both correctness and choosing the minority action (fixed or proportion-based bonus). We study exogenous signals and endogenous acquisition with a fixed entry cost and convex cost of precision in a Gaussian-quadratic specification. Contrarian motives shift equilibrium cutoffs away from 1/2 and expand the belief region where information is purchased, sustaining informative actions; conditional on investing, chosen precision is lower near central beliefs. Welfare is shaped by a trade-off: mild contrarianism counteracts premature herding, whereas strong contrarianism steers actions against informative social signals and induces low-value experimentation. A tractable characterization delivers closed-form cutoffs, comparative statics, and transparent welfare comparisons. Applications include scientific priority races and academic diffusion, where distinctiveness yields rents yet excessive contrarianism erodes information aggregation.</description>

      <title>Causal Effects in Matching Mechanisms with Strategically Reported Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing number of central authorities use assignment mechanisms to allocate students to schools in a way that reflects student preferences and school priorities. However, most real-world mechanisms incentivize students to strategically misreport their preferences. Misreporting complicates the identification of causal parameters that depend on true preferences, which are necessary inputs for a broad class of counterfactual analyses. In this paper, we provide an identification approach that is robust to strategic misreporting and derive sharp bounds on causal effects of school assignment on future outcomes. Our approach applies to any mechanism as long as there exist placement scores and cutoffs that characterize that mechanism's allocation rule. We use data from a deferred acceptance mechanism that assigns students to more than 1,000 university--major combinations in Chile. Matching theory predicts and empirical evidence suggests that students behave strategically in Chile because they face constraints on their submission of preferences and have good a priori information on the schools they will have access to. Our bounds are informative enough to reveal significant heterogeneity in graduation success with respect to preferences and school assignment.</description>
