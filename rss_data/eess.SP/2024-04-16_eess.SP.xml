      <title>Synthesis of Through-Wall Micro-Doppler Signatures of Human Motions Using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrowband radar micro-Doppler signatures are heavily used to identify and classify human activities. When the radar is operated in through-wall environments, the complex electromagnetic propagation phenomenology introduces considerable distortions in the micro-Doppler signatures through attenuation and multipath. The problem is particularly severe in inhomogeneous wall scenarios involving multiple wall layers, air gaps, or metal reinforcements. Through-wall radar data collection using simulations and measurements involves significant time and effort. In this paper, we propose an alternative method of synthesizing through-wall radar micro-Doppler signatures from their free space counterparts using the generative adversarial network (GAN). We train the GAN using radar micro-Doppler signatures generated from electromagnetic simulations. We generate the radar data for different human motions, along different orientations, and under diverse through-wall conditions. The synthetic radar micro-Dopplers generated from the neural networks are then evaluated for their realism using a denoising autoencoder, which shows an excellent realism score.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom for Radiating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic degrees of freedom are instrumental in antenna design, wireless communications, imaging, and scattering. Larger number of degrees of freedom enhances control in antenna design, influencing radiation patterns and directivity, while in communication systems, it links to spatial channels for increased data rates and reliability, and resolution in imaging. The correlation between computed degrees of freedom and physical quantities is not fully understood, prompting a comparison between classical estimates, Weyl's law, modal expansions, and optimization techniques. In this paper, it is shown that NDoF for arbitrary shaped radiating structures approaches the shadow area measured in squared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Optimizing Hybrid Quantum Noise Clusters for Gaussian Quantum Channel Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work contributes to the advancement of quantum communication by visualizing hybrid quantum noise in higher dimensions and optimizing the capacity of the quantum channel by using machine learning (ML). Employing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the quantum channel parameters are iteratively adjusted to estimate the channel capacity, facilitating the categorization of quantum noise data in higher dimensions into a finite number of clusters. In contrast to previous investigations that represented the model in lower dimensions, our work describes the quantum noise as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with mixing weights derived from a Poisson distribution. The objective was to model the quantum noise using a finite mixture of Gaussian components while preserving the mixing coefficients from the Poisson distribution. Approximating the infinite Gaussian mixture with a finite number of components makes it feasible to visualize clusters of quantum noise data without modifying the original probability density function. By implementing the EM algorithm, the research fine-tuned the channel parameters, identified optimal clusters, improved channel capacity estimation, and offered insights into the characteristics of quantum noise within an ML framework.</description>

      <title>Interferometer measurements in interstellar communications: methods and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extraterrestrial communication signals are hypothesized to be present in an extensive search space. Using principles of communication theory and system design, methods are studied and implemented to reduce the signal search space, while considering intentional transmitter detectability. The design and observational work reported in this paper adds material to previous related reports. (ref. arXiv:2105.03727, arXiv:2106.10168, arXiv:2202.12791, arXiv:2203.10065). In the current work, a two-element radio interferometer telescope and receiver algorithms are utilized to perform differential angle-of-arrival and multi-bandwidth measurements of delta-t delta-f polarized pulse pairs. The system enhances extraterrestrial signal detectability, while reducing signal false positives caused by noise and radio frequency interference. Statistical analysis utilizes a Right Ascension filter spanning celestial coordinate ranges that include the previously determined anomalous celestial direction: 5.25 +- 0.15 hr Right Ascension, -7.6 degrees +- 1 degree Declination. Observations were conducted during a duration of 61 days, comprising 244 hours of interferometer measurements.</description>

      <title>Design of Artificial Interference Signals for Covert Communication Aided by Multiple Friendly Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the scenario of covert communication aided by multiple friendly interference nodes. The objective is to conceal the legitimate communication link under the surveillance of a warden. We propose a novel strategy for generating artificial noise signals. In the absence of accurate channel fading information between the friendly interference nodes and the legitimate receiver, we leverage the statistical information of channel coefficients to optimize the basis matrix of the artificial noise signals space. The optimization aims to design artificial noise signals within the space to facilitate covert communication while minimizing the impact on the performance of legitimate communication. Due to the non-convex nature of the basis matrix constraints, the optimization problem is challenging to solve. Therefore, we employ the Riemannian optimization framework to analyze the geometric structure of the basis matrix constraints and transform the original non-convex optimization problem into an unconstrained problem on the complex Stiefel manifold for solution. Specifically, we utilize the Riemannian Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (R-SVRG) algorithm on the complex Stiefel manifold to solve the problem, significantly reducing the computational burden per iteration compared to full gradient algorithms. Additionally, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point. Finally, the performance of the proposed artificial noise strategy can be evaluated through numerical simulations, and compared to the Gaussian artificial noise strategy without optimization, the proposed strategy significantly improves covert performance.</description>

      <title>Optimum Beamforming and Grating Lobe Mitigation for Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring adequate wireless coverage in upcoming communication technologies such as 6G is expected to be challenging. This is because user demands of higher datarate require an increase in carrier frequencies, which in turn reduce the diffraction effects (and hence coverage) in complex multipath environments. Intelligent reflecting surfaces have been proposed as a way of restoring coverage by adaptively reflecting incoming electromagnetic waves in desired directions. This is accomplished by judiciously adding extra phases at different points on the surface. In practice, these extra phases are only available in discrete quantities due to hardware constraints. Computing these extra phases is computationally challenging when they can only be picked from a discrete distribution, and existing approaches for solving this problem were either heuristic or based on evolutionary algorithms. We solve this problem by proposing fast algorithms with provably optimal solutions. Our algorithms have linear complexity, and are presented with rigorous proofs for their optimality. We show that the proposed algorithms exhibit better performance. We analyze situations when unwanted grating lobes arise in the radiation pattern, and discuss mitigation strategies, such as the use of triangular lattices and prephasing techniques, to eliminate them. We also demonstrate how our algorithms can leverage these techniques to deliver optimum beamforming solutions.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Information-Bottleneck for Goal-oriented Feature Extraction and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is an information theoretical framework to design a parsimonious and tunable feature-extraction mechanism, such that the extracted features are maximally relevant to a specific learning or inference task. Despite its theoretical value, the IB is based on a functional optimization problem that admits a closed form solution only on specific cases (e.g., Gaussian distributions), making it difficult to be applied in most applications, where it is necessary to resort to complex and approximated variational implementations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an approach to adapt the closed-form solution of the Gaussian IB to a general task. Whichever is the inference task to be performed by a (possibly deep) neural-network, the key idea is to opportunistically design a regression sub-task, embedded in the original problem, where we can safely assume a (joint) multivariate normality between the sub-task's inputs and outputs. In this way we can exploit a fixed and pre-trained neural network to process the input data, using a tunable number of features, to trade data-size and complexity for accuracy. This approach is particularly useful every time a device needs to transmit data (or features) to a server that has to fulfil an inference task, as it provides a principled way to extract the most relevant features for the task to be executed, while looking for the best trade-off between the size of the feature vector to be transmitted, inference accuracy, and complexity. Extensive simulation results testify the effectiveness of the proposed methodhttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#comments and encourage to further investigate this research line.</description>

      <title>A Joint Data Compression and Time-Delay Estimation Method For Distributed Systems via Extremum Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the proliferation of mobile devices, we consider a basic form of the ubiquitous problem of time-delay estimation (TDE), but with communication constraints between two non co-located sensors. In this setting, when joint processing of the received signals is not possible, a compression technique that is tailored to TDE is desirable. For our basic TDE formulation, we develop such a joint compression-estimation strategy based on the notion of what we term "extremum encoding", whereby we send the index of the maximum of a finite-length time-series from one sensor to another. Subsequent joint processing of the encoded message with locally observed data gives rise to our proposed time-delay "maximum-index"-based estimator. We derive an exponentially tight upper bound on its error probability, establishing its consistency with respect to the number of transmitted bits. We further validate our analysis via simulations, and comment on potential extensions and generalizations of the basic methodology.</description>

      <title>Novel entropy difference-based EEG channel selection technique for automated detection of ADHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the common neurodevelopmental disorders in children. This paper presents an automated approach for ADHD detection using the proposed entropy difference (EnD)- based encephalogram (EEG) channel selection approach. In the proposed approach, we selected the most significant EEG channels for the accurate identification of ADHD using an EnD-based channel selection approach. Secondly, a set of features is extracted from the selected channels and fed to a classifier. To verify the effectiveness of the channels selected, we explored three sets of features and classifiers. More specifically, we explored discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and symmetrically-weighted local binary pattern (SLBP)-based features. To perform automated classification, we have used k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Ensemble classifier, and support vectors machine (SVM) classifiers. Our proposed approach yielded the highest accuracy of 99.29% using the public database. In addition, the proposed EnD-based channel selection has consistently provided better classification accuracies than the entropy-based channel selection approach. Also, the developed method</description>

      <title>Listen to the Waves: Using a Neuronal Model of the Human Auditory System to Predict Ocean Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have evolved from the 1940s primitive models of brain function to become tools for artificial intelligence. They comprise many units, artificial neurons, interlinked through weighted connections. ANNs are trained to perform tasks through learning rules that modify the connection weights. With these rules being in the focus of research, ANNs have become a branch of machine learning developing independently from neuroscience. Although likely required for the development of truly intelligent machines, the integration of neuroscience into ANNs has remained a neglected proposition.
  Here, we demonstrate that designing an ANN along biological principles results in drastically improved task performance. As a challenging real-world problem, we choose real-time ocean-wave prediction which is essential for various maritime operations. Motivated by the similarity of ocean waves measured at a single location to sound waves arriving at the eardrum, we redesign an echo state network to resemble the brain's auditory system. This yields a powerful predictive tool which is computationally lean, robust with respect to network parameters, and works efficiently across a wide range of sea states. Our results demonstrate the advantages of integrating neuroscience with machine learning and offer a tool for use in the production of green energy from ocean waves.</description>

      <title>On Models and Approaches for Human Vital Signs Extraction from Short Range Radar Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper centres on an assessment of the modelling approaches for the processing of signals in CW and FMCW radar-based systems for the detection of vital signs. It is shown that the use of the widely adopted phase extraction method, which relies on the approximation of the target as a single point scatterer, has limitations in respect of the simultaneous estimation of both respiratory and heart rates. A method based on a velocity spectrum is proposed as an alternative with the ability to treat a wider range of application scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of semantic communication provides a novel approach for applications in scenarios with limited communication resources. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) semantic molecular communication system, aiming to enhance the efficiency of molecular communication systems by reducing the transmitted information. Specifically, following the joint source channel coding paradigm, the network is designed to encode the task-relevant information into the concentration of the information molecules, which is robust to the degradation of the molecular communication channel. Furthermore, we propose a channel network to enable the E2E learning over the non-differentiable molecular channel. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the semantic molecular communication system over the conventional methods in classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive Diver Respiration Rate Monitoring in Hyperbaric Lifeboat Environments using Short-Range Radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monitoring of diver health during emergency events is crucial to ensuring the safety of personnel. A non-invasive system continuously providing a measure of the respiration rate of individual divers is exceedingly beneficial in this context. The paper reports on the application of short-range radar to record the respiration rate of divers within hyperbaric lifeboat environments. Results demonstrate that the respiratory motion can be extracted from the radar return signal applying routine signal processing. Further, evidence is provided that the radar-based approach yields a more accurate measure of respiration rate than an audio signal from a headset microphone. The system promotes an improvement in evacuation protocols under critical operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-Phase Fusion for Enhanced Electrocardiogram Morphological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the variability of amplitude and phase patterns in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals due to cardiac activity and individual differences, existing entropy-based studies have not fully utilized these two patterns and lack integration. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fusion entropy metric, morphological ECG entropy (MEE) for the first time, specifically designed for ECG morphology, to comprehensively describe the fusion of amplitude and phase patterns. MEE is computed based on beat-level samples, enabling detailed analysis of each cardiac cycle. Experimental results demonstrate that MEE achieves rapid, accurate, and label-free localization of abnormal ECG arrhythmia regions. Furthermore, MEE provides a method for assessing sample diversity, facilitating compression of imbalanced training sets (via representative sample selection), and outperforms random pruning. Additionally, MEE exhibits the ability to describe areas of poor quality. By discussing, it proves the robustness of MEE value calculation to noise interference and its low computational complexity. Finally, we integrate this method into a clinical interactive interface to provide a more convenient and intuitive user experience. These findings indicate that MEE serves as a valuable clinical descriptor for ECG characterization. The implementation code can be referenced at the following link: https://github.com/fdu-harry/ECG-MEE-metric.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stability Assessment of Power Electronic Converters with Multi-Resolution Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic instability occurs frequently in the power electronic converter system. This paper leverages multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (MR-DMD) as a data-driven diagnostic tool for the system stability of power electronic converters, not requiring complex modeling and detailed control information. By combining dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with the multi-resolution analysis used in wavelet theory, dynamic modes and eigenvalues can be identified at different decomposition levels and time scales with the MR-DMD algorithm, thereby allowing for handling datasets with transient time behaviors, which is not achievable using conventional DMD. Further, the selection criteria for important parameters in MR-DMD are clearly defined through derivation, elucidating the reason for enabling it to extract eigenvalues within different frequency ranges.

      <description>arXiv:2404.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, custom frame synchronization architecture aimed at easy deployment on any hardware platform. Frame synchronization is the process of discerning valid data frames from an incoming transmission and in this article it is accomplished by attaching distinctive binary overhead sequences on the frames. These sequences act as markers for the frames and enable their capture. They have certain properties and can be detected by using only simple hardware constructs like XNOR gates and few-bit adders. A low-cost commercial FPGA was used for implementation (NEXYS 4 DDR).</description>

      <title>Reconstructing classes of 3D FRI signals from sampled tomographic projections at unknown angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional sampling schemes often assume that the sampling locations are known. Motivated by the recent bioimaging technique known as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM), we consider the problem of reconstructing an unknown 3D structure from samples of its 2D tomographic projections at unknown angles. We focus on 3D convex bilevel polyhedra and 3D point sources and show that the exact estimation of these 3D structures and of the projection angles can be achieved up to an orthogonal transformation. Moreover, we are able to show that the minimum number of projections needed to achieve perfect reconstruction is independent of the complexity of the signal model. By using the divergence theorem, we are able to retrieve the projected vertices of the polyhedron from the sampled tomographic projections, and then we show how to retrieve the 3D object and the projection angles from this information. The proof of our theorem is constructive and leads to a robust reconstruction algorithm, which we validate under various conditions. Finally, we apply aspects of the proposed framework to calibration of X-ray computed tomography (CT) data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study generative artificial intelligence (AI) agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design, from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Device Identification in Massive Random Access: A Multi-stage Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and low-latency wireless connectivity between the base station (BS) and a sparse set of sporadically active devices from a massive number of devices is crucial for random access in emerging massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This paper addresses the challenge of identifying active devices while meeting stringent access delay and reliability constraints in mMTC environments. A novel multi-stage active device identification framework is proposed where we aim to refine a partial estimate of the active device set using feedback and hypothesis testing across multiple stages eventually leading to an exact recovery of active devices after the final stage of processing. In our proposed approach, active devices independently transmit binary preambles during each stage, leveraging feedback signals from the BS, whereas the BS employs a non-coherent binary energy detection. The minimum user identification cost associated with our multi-stage non-coherent active device identification framework with feedback, in terms of the required number of channel-uses, is quantified using information-theoretic techniques in the asymptotic regime of total number of devices $\ell$ when the number of active devices $k$ scales as $k = {\Theta}(1)$. Practical implementations of our multi-stage active device identification schemes, leveraging Belief Propagation (BP) techniques, are also presented and evaluated. Simulation results show that our multi-stage BP strategies exhibit superior performance over single-stage strategies, even when considering overhead costs associated with feedback and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>RF-Diffusion: Radio Signal Generation via Time-Frequency Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with AIGC shines in CV and NLP, its potential in the wireless domain has also emerged in recent years. Yet, existing RF-oriented generative solutions are ill-suited for generating high-quality, time-series RF data due to limited representation capabilities. In this work, inspired by the stellar achievements of the diffusion model in CV and NLP, we adapt it to the RF domain and propose RF-Diffusion. To accommodate the unique characteristics of RF signals, we first introduce a novel Time-Frequency Diffusion theory to enhance the original diffusion model, enabling it to tap into the information within the time, frequency, and complex-valued domains of RF signals. On this basis, we propose a Hierarchical Diffusion Transformer to translate the theory into a practical generative DNN through elaborated design spanning network architecture, functional block, and complex-valued operator, making RF-Diffusion a versatile solution to generate diverse, high-quality, and time-series RF data. Performance comparison with three prevalent generative models demonstrates the RF-Diffusion's superior performance in synthesizing Wi-Fi and FMCW signals. We also showcase the versatility of RF-Diffusion in boosting Wi-Fi sensing systems and performing channel estimation in 5G networks.</description>

      <title>Foundational GPT Model for MEG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques can be used to first training unsupervised models on large amounts of unlabelled data, before fine-tuning the models on specific tasks. This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation. All code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricsinaruto/MEG-transfer-decoding).</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Evaluation of Speech Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The foundation model paradigm leverages a shared foundation model to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for various tasks, requiring minimal downstream-specific modeling and data annotation. This approach has proven crucial in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the speech processing community lacks a similar setup to explore the paradigm systematically. In this work, we establish the Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) to study the effectiveness of the paradigm for speech. We propose a unified multi-tasking framework to address speech processing tasks in SUPERB using a frozen foundation model followed by task-specialized, lightweight prediction heads. Combining our results with community submissions, we verify that the foundation model paradigm is promising for speech, and our multi-tasking framework is simple yet effective, as the best-performing foundation model shows competitive generalizability across most SUPERB tasks. For reproducibility and extensibility, we have developed a long-term maintained platform that enables deterministic benchmarking, allows for result sharing via an online leaderboard, and promotes collaboration through a community-driven benchmark database to support new development cycles. Finally, we conduct a series of analyses to offer an in-depth understanding of SUPERB and speech foundation models, including information flows across tasks inside the models, the correctness of the weighted-sum benchmarking protocol and the statistical significance and robustness of the benchmark.</description>

      <title>An Autoencoder-Based Constellation Design for AirComp in Wireless Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless federated learning (FL) relies on efficient uplink communications to aggregate model updates across distributed edge devices. Over-the-air computation (a.k.a. AirComp) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing the scalability challenge of FL over wireless links with limited communication resources. Unlike conventional methods, AirComp allows multiple edge devices to transmit uplink signals simultaneously, enabling the parameter server to directly decode the average global model. However, existing AirComp solutions are intrinsically analog, while modern wireless systems predominantly adopt digital modulations. Consequently, careful constellation designs are necessary to accurately decode the sum model updates without ambiguity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end communication system supporting AirComp with digital modulation, aiming to overcome the challenges associated with accurate decoding of the sum signal with constellation designs. We leverage autoencoder network structures and explore the joint optimization of transmitter and receiver components. Our approach fills an important gap in the context of accurately decoding the sum signal in digital modulation-based AirComp, which can advance the deployment of FL in contemporary wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis of satellite-terrestrial integrated radio access networks based on stochastic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance coverage and improve service continuity, satellite-terrestrial integrated radio access network (STIRAN) has been seen as an essential trend in the development of 6G. However, there is still a lack of theoretical analysis on its coverage performance. To fill this gap, we first establish a system model to characterize a typical scenario where low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and terrestrial base stations are both deployed. Then, stochastic geometry is utilized to analyze the downlink coverage probability under the setting of shared frequency and distinct frequencies. Specifically, we derive mathematical expressions for the distances distribution from the serving station to the typical user and the associated probability based on the maximum bias power selection strategy (Max-BPR). Taking into account real-world satellite antenna beamforming patterns in two system scenarios, we derive the downlink coverage probabilities in terms of parameters such as base station density and orbital inclination. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical derivations is verified through experimental simulations, and the influence of network design parameters on the downlink coverage probability is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Doppler Effect for Channel Charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel Charting is a dimensionality reduction technique that reconstructs a map of the radio environment from similarity relationships found in channel state information. Distances in the channel chart are often computed based on some dissimilarity metric, which can be derived from angular-domain information, channel impulse responses, measured phase differences or simply timestamps. Using such information implicitly makes strong assumptions about the level of phase and time synchronization between base station antennas or assumes approximately constant transmitter velocity. Many practical systems, however, may not provide phase and time synchronization and single-antenna base stations may not even have angular-domain information. We propose a Doppler effect-based loss function for Channel Charting that only requires frequency synchronization between spatially distributed base station antennas, which is a much weaker assumption. We use a dataset measured in an indoor environment to demonstrate that the proposed method is practically feasible with just four base station antennas, that it produces a channel chart that is suitable for localization in the global coordinate frame and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under the given limitations.</description>

      <title>OpenAirLink: Reproducible Wireless Channel Emulation using Software Defined Radios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents OpenAirLink(OAL), an open-source channel emulator for reproducible testing of wireless scenarios. OAL is implemented on off-the-shelf software-defined radios (SDR) and presents a smaller-scale alternative to expensive commercially available channel emulators. Path loss and propagation delay are the fundamental aspects of emulating a wireless channel. OAL provides a simple method to change these aspects in real-time. The emulator is implemented using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The FIR filter is written in Verilog and flashed on the SDRs Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Most processing transpires on the FPGA, so OAL does not require high-performance computing hardware and SDRs. We validate the performance of OAL and demonstrate the utility of such a channel emulation tool using two examples. We believe that open-source channel emulators such as OAL can make reproducible wireless experiments accessible to many researchers in the scientific community.</description>

Abstract: This letter investigates the weighted sum rate maximization problem in movable antenna (MA)-enhanced systems. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform it into a more tractable weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problem well-suited for MA. We then adopt the WMMSE algorithm and majorization-minimization algorithm to optimize the beamforming and antenna positions, respectively. Moreover, we propose a planar movement mode, which constrains each MA to a specified area, we obtain a low-complexity closed-form solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the MA-enhanced system outperforms the conventional system. Besides, the computation time for the planar movement mode is reduced by approximately 30\% at a little performance expense.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a gray-box stability analysis mechanism based on data-driven dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for commercial grid-tied power electronics converters with limited information on its control parameters and topology. By fusing the underlying physical constraints of the state equations into data snapshots, the system dynamic state matrix and input matrix are simultaneously approximated to identify the dominant system dynamic modes and eigenvalues using the DMD with control (DMDc) algorithm. While retaining the advantages of eliminating the need for intrinsic controller information, the proposed gray-box method establishes higher accuracy and interpretable outcomes over the conventional DMD method. Finally, under experimental conditions of a low-frequency oscillation scenario in electrified railways featuring a single-phase converter, the proposed gray-box DMDc is verified to identify the dominant eigenvalues more accurately.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Ensembling of Multiple Software Sensors with Phase Synchronization: A Robust Approach For Electrocardiogram-derived Respiration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.13054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: We aimed to fuse the outputs of different electrocardiogram-derived respiration (EDR) algorithms to create one EDR signal that is of higher quality. Methods: We viewed each EDR algorithm as a software sensor that recorded breathing activity from a different vantage point, identified high-quality software sensors based on the respiratory signal quality index, aligned the highest-quality EDRs with a phase synchronization technique based on the graph connection Laplacian, and finally fused those aligned, high-quality EDRs. We refer to the output as the sync-ensembled EDR signal. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on two large-scale databases of whole-night polysomnograms. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm using three respiratory signals recorded from different hardware sensors, and compared it with other existing EDR algorithms. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for a total of five cases: fusion by taking the mean of EDR signals, and the four cases of EDR signal alignment without and with synchronization and without and with signal quality selection. Results: The sync-ensembled EDR algorithm outperforms existing EDR algorithms when evaluated by the synchronized correlation ({\gamma}-score), optimal transport (OT) distance, and estimated average respiratory rate (EARR) score, all with statistical significance. The sensitivity analysis shows that the signal quality selection and EDR signal alignment are both critical for the performance, both with statistical significance. Conclusion: The sync-ensembled EDR provides robust respiratory information from electrocardiogram. Significance: Phase synchronization is not only theoretically rigorous but also practical to design a robust EDR.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Positioning Design in RIS-empowered OFDM System: a Correlation Dispersion Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel integrated communication and positioning design for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in indoor circumstances. The channel frequency responses on pilots (CFROPs) of places of interest are used for online mapping with the offline CFROP database. We transform the objective of minimizing the similarity of different CFROPs into creating a differentiated database by optimizing the phase coefficients of RIS. Imperfect channel state information is considered due to time-varying caused by the two-stage mapping. We formulate a universal optimization problem for maximizing either the average or the minimum virtual distance of CFROPs. The communication service requirements are converted as constraints. A moderate case is discussed to reduce computational complexity with minor accuracy loss. A special property called correlation dispersion is analyzed. It is capable of eliminating the spatial consistency that incurs inaccuracy to traditional positioning methods. The property and the moderate case complement each other well with clear and logical physical interpretation. The particular characteristic makes our design outperform others especially in high-level-noise environments. It works even better when the prior information of user's potential location is available. The validity of our design is confirmed by numerical results.</description>

All the sources are located in noisy and reverberant environments and are received by a microphone array. We propose a new approach for designing beamformers and DoA estimation methods based on the Riemannian geometry of the manifold of Hermitian positive definite matrices. Specifically, we show theoretically that incorporating the Riemannian mean of the spatial correlation matrices into frequently-used beamformers gives rise to spatial spectra that reject the directions of interference sources and result in a higher signal-to-interference ratio. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our approach in designing several beamformers and a recent DoA estimation method in the presence of simultaneously active multiple interference sources.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Smoothness of Graph Signals: A Graph Signal Processing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) deals with the representation, analysis, and processing of structured data, i.e. graph signals that are defined on the vertex set of a generic graph. A crucial prerequisite for applying various GSP and graph neural network (GNN) approaches is that the examined signals are smooth graph signals with respect to the underlying graph, or, equivalently, have low graph total variation (TV). In this paper, we develop GSP-based approaches to verify the validity of the smoothness assumption of given signals (data) and an associated graph. The proposed approaches are based on the representation of network data as the output of a graph filter with a given graph topology. In particular, we develop two smoothness detectors for the graph-filter-output model: 1) the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for known model parameters; and 2) a semi-parametric detector that estimates the graph filter and then validates its smoothness. The properties of the proposed GSP-based detectors are investigated, and some special cases are discussed. The performance of the GSP-based detectors is evaluated using synthetic data, data from the IEEE 14-bus power system, and measurements from a network of light intensity sensors, under different setups. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its robustness to different generating models, noise levels, and number of samples.</description>

      <title>Large Transformers are Better EEG Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained large transformer models have achieved remarkable performance in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. However, the limited availability of public electroencephalogram (EEG) data presents a unique challenge for extending the success of these models to EEG-based tasks. To address this gap, we propose AdaCT, plug-and-play Adapters designed for Converting Time series data into spatio-temporal 2D pseudo-images or text forms. Essentially, AdaCT-I transforms multi-channel or lengthy single-channel time series data into spatio-temporal 2D pseudo-images for fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers, while AdaCT-T converts short single-channel data into text for fine-tuning pre-trained language transformers. The proposed approach allows for seamless integration of pre-trained vision models and language models in time series decoding tasks, particularly in EEG data analysis. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets, including Epileptic Seizure Recognition, Sleep-EDF, and UCI HAR, demonstrate the superiority of AdaCT over baseline methods. Overall, we provide a promising transfer learning framework for leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained vision and language models in EEG-based tasks, thereby advancing the field of time series decoding and enhancing interpretability in EEG data analysis. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wangbxj1234/AdaCE.</description>

      <title>Which Framework is Suitable for Online 3D Multi-Object Tracking for Autonomous Driving with Automotive 4D Imaging Radar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) has recently received significant research interests due to the expanding demand of 3D perception in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD). Among the existing 3D MOT frameworks for ADAS and AD, conventional point object tracking (POT) framework using the tracking-by-detection (TBD) strategy has been well studied and accepted for LiDAR and 4D imaging radar point clouds. In contrast, extended object tracking (EOT), another important framework which accepts the joint-detection-and-tracking (JDT) strategy, has rarely been explored for online 3D MOT applications. This paper provides the first systematical investigation of the EOT framework for online 3D MOT in real-world ADAS and AD scenarios. Specifically, the widely accepted TBD-POT framework, the recently investigated JDT-EOT framework, and our proposed TBD-EOT framework are compared via extensive evaluations on two open source 4D imaging radar datasets: View-of-Delft and TJ4DRadSet. Experiment results demonstrate that the conventional TBD-POT framework remains preferable for online 3D MOT with high tracking performance and low computational complexity, while the proposed TBD-EOT framework has the potential to outperform it in certain situations. However, the results also show that the JDT-EOT framework encounters multiple problems and performs inadequately in evaluation scenarios. After analyzing the causes of these phenomena based on various evaluation metrics and visualizations, we provide possible guidelines to improve the performance of these MOT frameworks on real-world data. These provide the first benchmark and important insights for the future development of 4D imaging radar-based online 3D MOT algorithms.</description>

      <title>Class Information Guided Reconstruction for Automatic Modulation Open-Set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is a crucial technology in the domains of radar and communications. Traditional AMR approaches assume a closed-set scenario, where unknown samples are forcibly misclassified into known classes, leading to serious consequences for situation awareness and threat assessment. To address this issue, Automatic Modulation Open-set Recognition (AMOSR) defines two tasks as Known Class Classification (KCC) and Unknown Class Identification (UCI). However, AMOSR faces core challenges in terms of inappropriate decision boundaries and sparse feature distributions. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Class Information guided Reconstruction (CIR) framework, which leverages reconstruction losses to distinguish known and unknown classes. To enhance distinguishability, we design Class Conditional Vectors (CCVs) to match the latent representations extracted from input samples, achieving perfect reconstruction for known samples while yielding poor results for unknown ones. We also propose a Mutual Information (MI) loss function to ensure reliable matching, with upper and lower bounds of MI derived for tractable optimization and mathematical proofs provided. The mutually beneficial CCVs and MI facilitate the CIR attaining optimal UCI performance without compromising KCC accuracy, especially in scenarios with a higher proportion of unknown classes. Additionally, a denoising module is introduced before reconstruction, enabling the CIR to achieve a significant performance improvement at low SNRs. Experimental results on simulated and measured signals validate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for OTFS Data Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising solution to support high-mobility wireless communications, for which, cost-effective data detectors are critical. Although graph neural network (GNN)-based data detectors can achieve decent detection accuracy at reasonable computational cost, they fail to best harness prior information of transmitted data. To further minimize the data detection error of OTFS systems, this letter develops an AMP-GNN-based detector, leveraging the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to iteratively improve the symbol estimates of a GNN. Given the inter-Doppler interference (IDI) symbols incur substantial computational overhead to the constructed GNN, learning-based IDI approximation is implemented to sustain low detection complexity. Simulation results demonstrate a remarkable bit error rate (BER) performance achieved by the proposed AMP-GNN-based detector compared to existing baselines. Meanwhile, the proposed IDI approximation scheme avoids a large amount of computations with negligible BER degradation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate federated learning (FL) in the presence of stragglers, with emphasis on wireless scenarios where the power-constrained edge devices collaboratively train a global model on their local datasets and transmit local model updates through fading channels. To tackle stragglers resulting from link disruptions without requiring accurate prior information on connectivity or dataset sharing, we propose a gradient coding (GC) scheme based on cooperative communication, which remains valid for general collaborative federated learning. Furthermore, we conduct an outage analysis of the proposed scheme, based on which we conduct the convergence analysis. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed strategy in the presence of stragglers, especially under imbalanced data distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accelerated pace of global population growth underscores the crucial role of the agricultural sector in mitigating food scarcity, as well as in supporting livelihoods through employment opportunities and bolstering national economies. This sector faces several critical challenges, including resource depletion, socioeconomic issues, gaps in technology and innovation, and the impact of climate change. The introduction of mechanization has significantly transformed agriculture by enhancing sustainability and increasing the productivity of crops. Recently, traditional farming methods have been supplemented with advanced technologies steering the industry towards precision agriculture. The convergence of these advanced technologies has facilitated the automation of various tasks such as water management, crop monitoring, disease management, and harvesting. The concept of Internet of Everything (IoE) has gained traction due to its holistic approach towards integrating various IoT specializations, called IoXs where X referring to a specific domain. This includes areas like the Internet of Sensors (IoS), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Internet of Energy (IoEn), Internet of Space Things (IoST), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Internet of Drones (IoD). This paper explores the potential of the Internet of Everything (IoE) in revolutionizing agricultural systems. The focus is on assessing the impact of cutting-edge and novel technologies, such as 6G, molecular communication (MC), Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), Internet of Fungus, and designer phages, in significantly improving agricultural yield, efficiency, and productivity. Additionally, the potential of these technologies is evaluated in terms of their applicability, associated challenges, and future research directions within the realm of precision agriculture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we formalize an optimization framework for analog beamforming in the context of monostatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where we also address the problem of self-interference in the analog domain. As a result, we derive semidefinite programs to approach detection-optimal transmit and receive beamformers, and we devise a superiorized iterative projection algorithm to approximate them. Our simulations show that this approach outperforms the detection performance of well-known design techniques for ISAC beamforming, while it achieves satisfactory self-interference suppression.</description>

      <title>Message Passing-Based Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for OTFS with Superimposed Pilots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Receivers with joint channel estimation and signal detection using superimposed pilots (SP) can achieve high transmission efficiency in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems. However, existing receivers have high computational complexity, hindering their practical applications. In this work, with SP in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and the generalized complex exponential (GCE) basis expansion modeling (BEM) for channels, a message passing-based SP-DD iterative receiver is proposed, which drastically reduces the computational complexity while with marginal performance loss, compared to existing ones. To facilitate channel estimation (CE) in the proposed receiver, we design pilot signal to achieve pilot power concentration in the frequency domain, thereby developing an SP-DD-D receiver that can effectively reduce the power of the pilot signal and almost no loss of CE accuracy. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SP-DD-D receiver.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Near-Field ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the technical trends for the next-generation wireless network significantly extend the near-field region, a performance reevaluation of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) with an appropriate channel model to account for the effects introduced by the near field becomes essential. In this paper, a near-field ISAC framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios based on an accurate channel model. A uniform planar array is equipped at a base station, where the impacts of the effective aperture and polarization of antennas are considered. For the downlink case, three distinct designs are studied: a communications-centric (C-C) design, a sensing-centric (S-C) design, and a Pareto optimal design. Regarding the uplink case, the C-C design, the S-C design and a time-sharing strategy are considered. Within each design, sensing rates (SRs) and communication rates (CRs) are derived. To gain further insights, high signal-to-noise ratio slopes and rate scaling laws concerning the number of antennas are examined. The attainable near-field SR-CR regions of ISAC and the baseline frequency-division S&amp;C are also characterized. Numerical results reveal that, as the number of antennas in the array grows, the SRs and CRs under our accurate model converge to finite values, while those under conventional far- and near-field models exhibit unbounded growth, highlighting the importance of precisely modeling the channels for near-field ISAC.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Receive Generalized Spatial Modulation Design with Reflecting Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial modulation (SM) transmits additional information bits by the selection of antennas. Generalized spatial modulation (GSM), as an advanced type of SM, can be divided into diversity and multiplexing (MUX) schemes according to the symbols carried on the selected antennas are identical or different. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted SM exhibits better reception performance compared to conventional SM. To overcome the limitations of SM, this paper combines GSM with RIS and proposes the RIS-aided receive generalized spatial modulation (RIS-RGSM) scheme. The RIS-RGSM diversity scheme is realized via a simple improvement based on the state-of-the-art scheme. To further increase the transmission rate, a novel RIS-RGSM MUX scheme is proposed, where the reflection phase shifts and on/off states of RIS elements are configured to achieve bit mapping. The theoretical bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme is derived and agrees well with the simulation results. Numerical simulations show that the RIS-RGSM MUX scheme has better BER performance than the diversity scheme. The proposed scheme can significantly increase the transmission rate and maintain good performance compared to the existing scheme under a limited number of antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) techniques promise to authenticate wireless devices at the physical layer based on inherent hardware imperfections introduced during manufacturing. Such RF transmitter imperfections are reflected into over-the-air signals, allowing receivers to accurately identify the RF transmitting source. Recent advances in Machine Learning, particularly in Deep Learning (DL), have improved the ability of RFF systems to extract and learn complex features that make up the device-specific fingerprint. However, integrating DL techniques with RFF and operating the system in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges, originating from the embedded systems and the DL research domains. This paper systematically identifies and analyzes the essential considerations and challenges encountered in the creation of DL-based RFF systems across their typical development life-cycle, which include (i) data collection and preprocessing, (ii) training, and finally, (iii) deployment. Our investigation provides a comprehensive overview of the current open problems that prevent real deployment of DL-based RFF systems while also discussing promising research opportunities to enhance the overall accuracy, robustness, and privacy of these systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Semi-supervised Machine Learning with Surrogate Safety Measures for Abnormal Driving Behavior Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting abnormal driving behavior is critical for road traffic safety and the evaluation of drivers' behavior. With the advancement of machine learning (ML) algorithms and the accumulation of naturalistic driving data, many ML models have been adopted for abnormal driving behavior detection. Most existing ML-based detectors rely on (fully) supervised ML methods, which require substantial labeled data. However, ground truth labels are not always available in the real world, and labeling large amounts of data is tedious. Thus, there is a need to explore unsupervised or semi-supervised methods to make the anomaly detection process more feasible and efficient. To fill this research gap, this study analyzes large-scale real-world data revealing several abnormal driving behaviors (e.g., sudden acceleration, rapid lane-changing) and develops a Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machines (HELM) based semi-supervised ML method using partly labeled data to accurately detect the identified abnormal driving behaviors. Moreover, previous ML-based approaches predominantly utilize basic vehicle motion features (such as velocity and acceleration) to label and detect abnormal driving behaviors, while this study seeks to introduce Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) as the input features for ML models to improve the detection performance. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised ML model with the introduced SSMs serving as important features. The proposed semi-supervised ML method outperforms other baseline semi-supervised or unsupervised methods regarding various metrics, e.g., delivering the best accuracy at 99.58% and the best F-1 measure at 0.9913. The ablation study further highlights the significance of SSMs for advancing detection performance.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is now widely regarded as an indispensable modeling and solution tool for the design of wireless communications systems. While optimization has played a significant role in the revolutionary progress in wireless communication and networking technologies from 1G to 5G and onto the future 6G, the innovations in wireless technologies have also substantially transformed the nature of the underlying mathematical optimization problems upon which the system designs are based and have sparked significant innovations in the development of methodologies to understand, to analyze, and to solve those problems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for wireless communication system design. We begin by illustrating common features of mathematical optimization problems arising in wireless communication system design. We discuss various scenarios and use cases and their associated mathematical structures from an optimization perspective. We then provide an overview of recently developed optimization techniques in areas ranging from nonconvex optimization, global optimization, and integer programming, to distributed optimization and learning-based optimization. The key to successful solution of mathematical optimization problems is in carefully choosing or developing suitable algorithms (or neural network architectures) that can exploit the underlying problem structure. We conclude the paper by identifying several open research challenges and outlining future research directions.</description>

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models as Virtual Annotators for Time-series Physical Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01133</link>

Abstract: Traditional human-in-the-loop-based annotation for time-series data like inertial data often requires access to alternate modalities like video or audio from the environment. These alternate sources provide the necessary information to the human annotator, as the raw numeric data is often too obfuscated even for an expert. However, this traditional approach has many concerns surrounding overall cost, efficiency, storage of additional modalities, time, scalability, and privacy. Interestingly, recent large language models (LLMs) are also trained with vast amounts of publicly available alphanumeric data, which allows them to comprehend and perform well on tasks beyond natural language processing. Naturally, this opens up a potential avenue to explore LLMs as virtual annotators where the LLMs will be directly provided the raw sensor data for annotation instead of relying on any alternate modality. Naturally, this could mitigate the problems of the traditional human-in-the-loop approach. Motivated by this observation, we perform a detailed study in this paper to assess whether the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs can be used as virtual annotators for labeling time-series physical sensing data. To perform this in a principled manner, we segregate the study into two major phases. In the first phase, we investigate the challenges an LLM like GPT-4 faces in comprehending raw sensor data. Considering the observations from phase 1, in the next phase, we investigate the possibility of encoding the raw sensor data using SOTA SSL approaches and utilizing the projected time-series data to get annotations from the LLM. Detailed evaluation with four benchmark HAR datasets shows that SSL-based encoding and metric-based guidance allow the LLM to make more reasonable decisions and provide accurate annotations without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning or sophisticated prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev and The Fast Fourier Transform Methods for Signal Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximation theorem is one of the most important aspects of numerical analysis that has evolved over the years with many different approaches. Some of the most popular approximation methods include the Lebesgue approximation theorem, the Weierstrass approximation, and the Fourier approximation theorem. The limitations associated with various approximation methods are too crucial to ignore, and thus, the nature of a specific dataset may require using a specific approximation method for such estimates. In this report, we shall delve into Chebyshev's polynomials interpolation in detail as an alternative approach to reconstructing signals and compare the reconstruction to that of the Fourier polynomials. We will also explore the advantages and limitations of the Chebyshev polynomials and discuss in detail their mathematical formulation and equivalence to the cosine function over a given interval [a, b].</description>
