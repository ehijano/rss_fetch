      <title>Impact of Electron Precipitation on Brown Dwarf Atmospheres and the Missing Auroral H$_{3}^{+}$ Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have demonstrated that very-low mass stars and brown dwarfs are capable of sustaining strong magnetic fields despite their cool and neutral atmospheres. These kG field strengths are inferred based on strong highly circularly polarized GHz radio emission, a consequence of the electron cyclotron maser instability. Crucially, these observations imply the existence of energetic non-thermal electron populations, associated with strong current systems, as are found in the auroral regions of the magnetized planets of the Solar System. Intense auroral electron precipitation will lead to electron collisions with the H$_{2}$ gas that should ultimately generate the ion H$_{3}^{+}$. With this motivation, we targeted a sample of ultracool dwarfs, known to exhibit signatures associated with aurorae, in search of the K-band emission features of H$_{3}^{+}$ using the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea. From our sample of 9 objects, we found no clear indication of H$_{3}^{+}$ emission features in our low-medium resolution spectra (R$\sim$3600). We also modeled the impact of an auroral electron beam on a brown dwarf atmosphere, determining the depth at which energetic beams deposit their energy and drive particle impact ionization. We find that the H$_{3}^{+}$ non-detections can be explained by electron beams of typical energies $\gtrsim$2-10~keV, which penetrate deeply enough that any H$_{3}^{+}$ produced is chemically destroyed before radiating energy through its infrared transitions. Strong electron beams could further explain the lack of UV detections, and suggest that most or nearly all of the precipitating auroral energy must ultimately emerge as thermal emissions deep in brown dwarf atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Binarity Enhances the Occurrence Rate of Radiation Belt Emissions in Ultracool Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a burgeoning set of ultracool dwarf ($\leq$M7) radio detections, their radio emissions remain enigmatic. Open questions include the plasma source and acceleration mechanisms for the non-auroral "quiescent" component of these objects' radio emissions, which can trace Jovian synchrotron radiation belt analogs. Ultracool dwarf binary systems can provide test beds for examining the underlying physics for these plasma processes. We extend a recently developed occurrence rate calculation framework to compare the quiescent radio occurrence rate of binary systems to single objects. This generalized and semi-analytical framework can be applied to any set of astrophysical objects conceptualized as unresolved binary systems with approximately steady-state emission or absorption. We combine data available in the literature to create samples of 179 single ultracool dwarfs (82 M dwarfs, 74 L dwarfs, and 23 T/Y dwarfs) and 27 binary ultracool dwarf systems. Using these samples, we show that quiescent radio emissions occur in $54^{+11}_{-11}$ - $65^{+11}_{-12}$ per cent of binaries where both components are ultracool dwarfs, depending on priors. We also show that binarity enhances the ultracool dwarf quiescent radio occurrence rate relative to their single counterparts. Finally, we discuss potential implications for the underlying drivers of ultracool dwarf quiescent radio emissions, including possible plasma sources.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Merger Remnants: The DAQ Subclass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four years after the discovery of a unique DAQ white dwarf with a hydrogen-dominated and carbon-rich atmosphere, we report the discovery of four new DAQ white dwarfs, including two that were not recognized properly in the literature. We find all five DAQs in a relatively narrow mass and temperature range of $M=1.14-1.19~M_{\odot}$ and $T_{\rm eff}=13,000-17,000$ K. In addition, at least two show photometric variations due to rapid rotation with $\approx10$ min periods. All five are also kinematically old, but appear photometrically young with estimated cooling ages of about 1 Gyr based on standard cooling tracks, and their masses are roughly twice the mass of the most common white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. These characteristics are smoking gun signatures of white dwarf merger remnants. Comparing the DAQ sample with warm DQ white dwarfs, we demonstrate that there is a range of hydrogen abundances among the warm DQ population, and the distinction between DAQ and warm DQ white dwarfs is superficial. We discuss the potential evolutionary channels for the emergence of the DAQ subclass, and suggest that DAQ white dwarfs are trapped on the crystallization sequence, and may remain there for a significant fraction of the Hubble time.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Molecular Line Emission from High-excitation Bipolar Planetary Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present early results from our program of ALMA Band 6 (1.3mm) molecular line mapping of a sample of nearby, well-studied examples of high-excitation, bipolar/pinched-waist and molecule-rich planetary nebulae (Hubble 5 and NGC 2440, 2818, 2899, 6302, and 6445). We have mapped these planetary nebulae (PNe) in isotopologues of CO as well as various molecular line tracers of high-energy irradiation, such as HCN, CN, HNC, and HCO+, with the complementary goals of establishing nebular kinematics as well as the zones of UV-heated and X-ray-ionized molecular gas within each nebula. The resulting high-resolution ALMA molecular emission-line maps reveal the regions of high-excitation bipolar PNe in which molecular gas, presumably ejected during asymptotic giant branch stages of the PN progenitor stars, survives and evolves chemically. We present a summary of molecular species detected to date in the sample nebulae, and we use example results for one PN (NGC 6455) to demonstrate the power of the ALMA data in revealing the structures, kinematics, and compositions of the equatorial molecular tori that are a common feature of the sample objects.</description>

      <title>Sun-as-a-star Study of an X-class Solar Flare with Spectroscopic Observations of CHASE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic characteristics of solar flares can be used as a benchmark for the detection and analyses of stellar flares. Here, we study the Sun-as-a-star properties of an X1.0 solar flare using high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained by the Chinese $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). A noise reduction algorithm based on discrete Fourier transformation is first employed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the space-integral $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ spectrum with a focus on its typical characteristics. For the flare of interest, we find that the average $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profile displays a strong emission at the line center and an obvious line broadening. It also presents a clear red asymmetry, corresponding to a redshift velocity of around $50 \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ that slightly decreases with time, consistent with previous results. Furthermore, we study how the size of the space-integral region affects the characteristics of the flare Sun-as-a-star $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profile. It is found that although the redshift velocity calculated from the $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profile remains unchanged, the detectability of the characteristics weakens as the space-integral region becomes large. An upper limit for the size of the target region where the red asymmetry is detectable is estimated. It is also found that the intensity in $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ profiles, measured by the equivalent widths of the spectra, are significantly underestimated if the $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ spectra are further averaged in the time domain.</description>

      <title>Analysis of BMR tilt from AutoTAB catalog: Hinting towards the thin flux tube model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the intriguing mechanisms of the Sun is the formation of the bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) in the solar convection zone which are observed as regions of concentrated magnetic fields of opposite polarity on photosphere. These BMRs are tilted with respect to the equatorial line, which statistically increases with latitude. The thin flux tube model, employing the rise of magnetically buoyant flux loops and their twist by Coriolis force, is a popular paradigm for explaining the formation of tilted BMRs. In this study, we assess the validity of the thin flux tube model by analyzing the tracked BMR data obtained through the Automatic Tracking Algorithm for BMRs (AutoTAB). Our observations reveal that the tracked BMRs exhibit the expected collective behaviors. We find that the polarity separation of BMRs increases over their normalized lifetime, supporting the assumption of a rising flux tube from the CZ. Moreover, we observe an increasing trend of the tilt with the flux of the BMR, suggesting that rising flux tubes associated with lower flux regions are primarily influenced by drag force and Coriolis force, while in higher flux regions, magnetic buoyancy dominates. Furthermore, we observe Joy's law dependence for emerging BMRs from their first detection, indicating that at least a portion of the tilt observed in BMRs can be attributed to the Coriolis force. Notably, lower flux regions exhibit a higher amount of fluctuations associated with their tilt measurement compared to stronger flux regions, suggesting that lower flux regions are more susceptible to turbulent convection.</description>

      <title>Determining stellar accretion rates from $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$ emission lines with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we present the first systematic spectroscopic measurements of the Near-InfraRed (NIR) hydrogen recombination lines $Pa_{\alpha}$ ($\lambda = 1.875 \mu m$) and $Br_{\beta}$ ($\lambda = 2.626 \mu m$), produced by pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. These stars, consisting of T Tauri and Herbig AeBe stars are located in the massive Galactic star-formation region NGC 3603. The measurements were obtained from JWST NIRSpec, using multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode. Utilising existing empirical relations between $L_{acc}$ and $L_{Br_{\gamma}}$, we have used our new measurements to formulate, for the first time, an empirical relationship between the accretion luminosity $L_{acc}$ of the stars, and the line luminosities $L_{line}$ of both $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$. These relationships are: $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.42 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Pa_{\alpha}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 3.33 (\pm 0.42)$ and $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.47 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Br_{\beta}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 4.60 (\pm 0.57)$. These new relationships are key for roughly estimating the accretion rates for large samples of PMS stars with JWST.</description>

      <title>The Present-Day Mass Function of Star Clusters in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93~star clusters utilizing Gaia DR3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $\alpha$, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of $\alpha$ for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$, exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with $\alpha$, as $\alpha$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of $\alpha$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between $\alpha$ and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes.</description>

      <title>HST astrometry of the closest Brown Dwarfs -- II. Improved parameters and constraints on a third body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Located at less than 2pc away, Luhman16AB (WISE.J104915.57-531906.1) is the closest pair of brown dwarfs and third closest `stellar' system to Earth. An exoplanet candidate in the Luhman16 binary system was reported in 2017 based on a weak astrometric signature in the analysis of 12 HST epochs. An additional epoch collected in 2018 and re-analysis of the data with more advanced methods further increased the significance level of the candidate, consistent with a Neptune-mass exoplanet orbiting one of the Luhman16 brown dwarf components. We report the joint analysis of these previous data together with two new astrometric HST epochs we obtained to confirm or disprove this astrometric signature. Our new analysis rules out presence of a planet orbiting one component of the Luhman16AB system for masses M &gt; 1.5 M_Nep (Neptune masses) and periods between 400 and 5000 days. However, the presence of third bodies with masses M &lt; 3 M_Nep and periods between 2 and 400 days (~1.1yrs) can not be excluded. Our measurements make significant improvements to the characterization of this sub-stellar binary, including its mass-ratio 0.8305+/-0.0006, individual component masses 35.4+/-0.2 M_Jup and 29.4+/-0.2 M_Jup (Jupiter masses), and parallax distance 1.9960pc +/- 50AU. Comparison of the masses and luminosities of Luhman16AB to several evolutionary models shows persistent discrepancies in the ages of the two components, but strengthens the case that this system is a member of the 510+/-95 Myr Oceanus Moving Group.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Pollution; One Star or Two?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion of tidally disrupted planetary bodies is the current consensus model for the presence of photospheric metals commonly detected in white dwarfs. While most dynamical studies have considered a single star and associated planetary instabilities, several investigations have instead considered the influence of widely-bound stellar companions as potential drivers of white dwarf pollution. This study examines the prevalence of wide binaries among polluted white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 astrometry, where three samples are investigated: 71 DAZ stars with metals detected in the ultraviolet using Hubble, and two groups of DZ stars identified via SDSS spectroscopy, comprised of 116 warmer and 101 cooler sources. Each sample was searched for spatially-resolved, co-moving companions, and compared to the same analysis of thousands of field white dwarfs within overlapping regions of the Gaia HR diagram. The wide binary fraction of the DAZ sample is $10.6_{-3.2}^{+3.9}$ per cent, and within $1 \sigma$ of the corresponding field. However, the search yields wide binary fractions of less than 1.8 per cent for the two independent DZ star catalogues, which are each distinct from their fields by more than $3 \sigma$. Both sets of results support that pollution in white dwarfs is not the result of stellar companions, and the delivery of metals to white dwarf surfaces is caused by major planets. The discrepancy between the DAZ and DZ star wide binary fractions cannot be caused by white dwarf spectral evolution, suggesting these two populations may have distinct planetary architectures.</description>

      <title>Moving Towards Automated Interstellar Boundary Explorer Data Selection with LOTUS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite collects data on energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that provide insight into the heliosphere, the region surrounding our solar system and separating it from interstellar space. IBEX collects information on these particles and on extraneous ``background'' particles. While IBEX records how and when the different particles are observed, it does not distinguish between heliospheric ENA particles and incidental background particles. To address this issue, all IBEX data has historically been manually labeled as ``good'' ENA data, or ``bad'' background data. This manual culling process is incredibly time-intensive and contingent on subjective, manually-induced decision thresholds. In this paper, we develop a three-stage automated culling process, called LOTUS, that uses random forests to expedite and standardize the labelling process. In Stage 1, LOTUS uses random forests to obtain probabilities of observing true ENA particles on a per-observation basis. In Stage 2, LOTUS aggregates these probabilities to obtain predictions within small windows of time. In Stage 3, LOTUS refines these predictions. We compare the labels generated by LOTUS to those manually generated by the subject matter expert. We use various metrics to demonstrate that LOTUS is a useful automated process for supplementing and standardizing the manual culling process.</description>

      <title>Nebular Nitrogen Line Emission in Stripped-Envelope Supernovae -- a New Progenitor Mass Diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen is produced by CNO-cycling in massive stars, and can be ejected in significant amounts in supernova explosions. While in H-rich SNe, its [\ion{N}{II}] 6548, 6583 emission becomes obscured by strong H$\alpha$, in explosions of He stars, this nitrogen emission becomes more visible. We here explore the formation of this line, using the \texttt{SUMO} code to compute spectra for a grid of 1D models with parameterized mixing informed from new 2D simulations. Because the mass fraction of nitrogen in the ejecta decreases with larger He core masses, as more of the He/N zone gets processed by shell helium burning and is lost to winds, the [\ion{N}{II}] luminosity relative to the overall optical flux probes the He core mass. By comparing to large samples of data, we find that low-mass He cores ($M_{\rm preSN}\lesssim\ 3\ M_\odot$) are exclusively associated with Type IIb SNe, with the exception of Type Ib SN 2007Y. Seeing no strong nitrogen emission in other Type Ib SNe, the implication is either an origin from low-mass stars with the He/N layer (but not the He/C) layer peeled away, or from higher-mass He cores. We also see no clear nitrogen emission in Type Ic SNe. We discuss the diagnostic potential of this new line metric, and also dependencies on mass-loss-rate and metallicity.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Invisible: A Study of Gaia18ajz, a Candidate Black Hole Revealed by Microlensing</title>

Abstract: Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, we applied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe DarkLensCode, an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $t_\mathrm{E}=316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $t_\mathrm{E}=299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $M_L = 5.6^{+7.5}_{-2.5} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.05^{+0.78}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$ or $M_L = 12.0^{+14.9}_{-5.4} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.18^{+0.82}_{-0.63}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from glitch-induced f-mode oscillations in quark and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter in compact stars is dense enough that transient events within the star could have sufficiently high energies to produce detectable gravitational waves (GWs). These GWs could be used to constrain the equation of state (EoS) for matter in the star and could reveal that there is more than one type of EoS at play in the population, implying that multiple types of compact stars exist. One of these types could be quark stars, composed almost entirely of stable quark matter, and observing GWs is a way to test for the strange matter EoS. Here we explore the possibility that, if fundamental (f-) mode oscillations in pulsars are induced by a pulsar glitch, then these oscillations might produce detectable GWs. We use the existing population of pulsars and their glitches, as well as a much larger synthesized population, along with 15 EoSs (8 for neutron stars and 7 for quark stars) to generate frequencies, damping times, and GW strengths for each. We find that of the EoSs examined, all quark star EoSs produce narrower distributions of f-mode frequency than neutron star EoSs. This result, along with other elements of the data, could be used to differentiate between GWs (or other signals from f-modes) originating from neutron stars and quark stars and thus could confirm the existence of quark stars. We also find that GW astronomy is a potentially viable method for detecting a larger population of pulsars which are not observable electromagnetically and that future GW observatories have the possibility to greatly expand this capability.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of orbital evolution of LMC X-4: Existence of a second derivative of the orbital period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report here results from pulse arrival time delay analysis of the eclipsing high mass X-ray binary pulsar LMC X-4 using observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and AstroSat. Combining the orbital parameters determined from these observations with the historical measurements dating back to 1998, we have extended the $T_{\pi/2}$ epoch history of LMC X-4 by about 4600 binary orbits spanning about 18 years. We also report mid-eclipse time measurements ($T_{ecl}$) using data obtained from wide-field X-ray monitors of MAXI-GSC and Swift-BAT. Combining the new $T_{\pi/2}$ and $T_{ecl}$ estimates with all the previously reported values, we have significantly improved the orbital evolution measurement, which indicates that the orbital period is evolving at a time scale ($P_{\rm orb}/\dot{P}_{\rm orb}$ ) of about 0.8 Myr. For the first time in an accreting X-ray pulsar system, we confirm the existence of a second derivative of the orbital period, having an evolution time scale ($\dot{P}_{orb}/\ddot{P}_{orb}$) of about 55 yr. Detection of a second derivative of the orbital period in LMC X-4 makes its orbital evolution timescale more uncertain, which may also be true for other HMXBs. Independent solutions for the orbital evolution measurement using the mid-eclipse data and the pulse timing data are consistent with each other, and help us put an upper limit of 0.009 on the eccentricity of the binary system.</description>

      <title>Triage of the Gaia DR3 astrometric orbits. II. A census of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third data release of Gaia was the first to include orbital solutions assuming non-single stars. Here, we apply the astrometric triage technique of Shahaf et al. to identify binary star systems with companions that are not single main-sequence stars. Gaia's synthetic photometry of these binaries is used to distinguish between systems likely to have white-dwarf companions and those that may be hierarchical triples. The study uncovered a population of nearly 3200 binaries, characterised by orbital separations on the order of an astronomical unit, in which the faint astrometric companion is probably a white dwarf. This sample increases the number of orbitally solved binary systems of this type by about two orders of magnitude. Remarkably, over 110 of these systems exhibit significant ultraviolet excess flux, confirming this classification and, in some cases, indicating their relatively young cooling ages. We show that the sample is not currently represented in synthetic binary populations, and is not easily reproduced by available binary population synthesis codes. Therefore, it challenges current binary evolution models, offering a unique opportunity to gain insights into the processes governing white-dwarf formation, binary evolution, and mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the young open cluster NGC 2516 I: Photometric and spectroscopic observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroseismic modelling of isolated star presents significant challenges due to the difficulty in accurately determining stellar parameters, particularly the stellar age. These challenges can be overcomed by observing stars in open clusters, whose coeval members share an initial chemical composition. The light curves by TESS allow us to investigate and analyse stellar variations in clusters with an unprecedented level. We aim to detect gravity-mode oscillations in the early-type main-sequence members of the young open cluster NGC 2516. We selected the 301 member stars as our sample and analysed the TESS FFI light curves. We also collected high-resolution spectra using the FEROS for the g-mode pulsators. By fitting the theoretical isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of a cluster, we determined an age of 102 $\pm$ 15 Myr and inferred the extinction at 550 nm ($A_0$) is 0.53 $\pm$ 0.04 mag. We identified 147 stars with surface brightness modulations, 24 with g-mode pulsations ($\gamma$ Doradus or Slowly Pulsating B stars), and 35 with p-mode pulsations ($\delta$ Sct stars). When sorted by colour index, the amplitude spectra of the $\delta$ Sct stars show a distinct ordering and reveal a discernible frequency-temperature relationship. The near-core rotation rates, measured from period spacing patterns in two SPB and nine $\gamma$ Dor stars, reach up to 3/d . This is at the high end of the values found from Kepler data of field stars of similar variability type. The $\gamma$ Dor stars have internal rotation rates as high as 50% of their critical value, whereas the SPB stars exhibit rotation rates close to their critical rate. We did not find long-term brightness and colour variations in the mid-infrared, which suggests that there are no disk or shell formation events in our sample. We also discussed the results of our spectroscopic observations for the g-mode pulsators.</description>

      <title>The POKEMON Speckle Survey of Nearby M Dwarfs. III. The Stellar Multiplicity Rate of M Dwarfs within 15 pc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M dwarfs are ubiquitous in our galaxy, and the rate at which they host stellar companions, and the properties of these companions, provides a window into the formation and evolution of the star(s), and of any planets that they may host. The Pervasive Overview of 'Kompanions' of Every M dwarf in Our Neighborhood (POKEMON) speckle survey of nearby M dwarfs is volume-limited from M0V through M9V out to 15 pc, with additional targets at larger distances. In total, 1125 stars were observed, and 455 of these are within the volume-limited, 15-pc sample of M-dwarf primaries. When we combine the speckle observations with known companions from the literature, we find that the stellar multiplicity rate of M dwarfs within 15 pc is 23.7% plus or minus 2.0%, and that the companion rate is 29.0% plus or minus 2.1%. We also find that the projected separation distribution for multiples that are known to host planets peaks at 198 au, while the distribution for multiples that are not yet known to host planets peaks at 5.57 au. This result suggests that the presence of close-in stellar companions inhibits the formation of M-dwarf planetary systems, similar to what has been found for FGK stars.</description>

      <title>Identification of a Single Plasma Parcel during a Parker Solar Probe-Solar Orbiter radial alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Configurations where two spacecraft, such as Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), are radially aligned provide opportunities to study the evolution of a single solar wind parcel during so called plasma line-ups. The most critical part of such studies is arguably the identification of what can be considered a same plasma crossing both spacecraft. We present here a method that allowed us to find what we believe to be the same plasma parcel passing through PSP ($\sim 0.075$ au) and SolO ($\sim 0.9$ au) after their radial alignment the 29/04/2021. We started by modeling the plasma propagation in order to get a first estimation of the plasma line-up intervals. The identification of the same density structure (with a crossing duration $\sim 1.5$ h) passing through the two spacecraft allows to precise and confirm this estimation. Our main finding is how stable the density structure is, remaining well recognizable from PSP to SolO despite its $\sim 137$ hours journey in the inner heliosphere. We moreover found that the studied slow solar wind plasma parcel undergone a significant acceleration (from $\sim 200$ to $\sim 300$ km/s) during its propagation.</description>

      <title>HST Survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster in ACS/Visible and WFC3/IR Bands. IV. A Bayesian multi-wavelength study of stellar parameters in the ONC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Study of the SASI Comparing General Relativistic and Nonrelativistic Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics with GR gravity, and nonrelativistic (NR) hydrodynamics with Newtonian gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock and, by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star (PNS) compactness. We investigate four compactnesses expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the highest-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the highest-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.</description>
