      <title>Enhanced Beampattern Synthesis Using Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beampattern synthesis seeks to optimize array weights to shape radiation patterns, playing a critical role in various wireless applications. In addition to theoretical advancements, recent hardware innovations have facilitated new avenues to enhance beampattern synthesis performance. This paper studies the beampattern synthesis problem using newly proposed electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs). By utilizing spherical harmonics decomposition, we simultaneously optimize each antenna's radiation pattern and phase shift to match a desired beampattern of the entire array. The problem is formulated for both far-field and near-field scenarios, with the optimization solved using Riemannian manifold techniques. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and illustrate that ERAs exhibit superior beampattern synthesis capabilities compared to conventional fixed radiation pattern antennas. This advantage becomes increasingly significant as the array size grows.</description>

      <title>Passive Sonar Sensor Placement for Undersea Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of undersea threats is a complex problem of considerable importance for maritime regional surveillance and security. Multistatic sonar systems can provide a means to monitor for underwater threats, where fixed sensors, towed arrays and dipping sonars may be utilised for this purpose. However, it is advantageous to deploy passive sensors to provide a stealthy early warning system. Hence this paper is concerned with determining where a series of passive sonar sensors should be situated in order to provide an initial threat detection capability. In order to facilitate this it is necessary to derive a suitable expression for the probability of threat detection from a passive sensor. This is based upon considerations of the passive sonar equation. It will be demonstrated how the stochastic aspects of this equation may be modelled through appropriate random variables capturing the uncertainty in noise levels. Subsequently this is utilised to produce the system-level probability of threat detection. Since the threat location is also unknown an appropriate statistical model is introduced to account for this uncertainty. This then permits the specification of the probability of detection as a function of sensor locations. Consequently it is then possible to determine optimal sensor placement to maximise the threat detection probability. This provides a new way in which to determine whether a surveillance region is covered adequately by sensors. The methodology will be illustrated through a series of examples utilising passive sonar characteristics sourced from the open literature.</description>

      <title>RIS-enabled Multi-user M-QAM Uplink NOMA Systems: Design, Analysis, and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely recognized for enhancing the energy and spectral efficiency through effective radio resource sharing. However, uplink NOMA systems face greater challenges than their downlink counterparts, as their bit error rate (BER) performance is hindered by an inherent error floor due to error propagation caused by imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). This paper investigates BER performance improvements enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in multi-user uplink NOMA transmission. Specifically, we propose a novel RIS-assisted uplink NOMA design, where the RIS phase shifts are optimized to enhance the received signal amplitudes while mitigating the phase rotations induced by the channel. To achieve this, we first develop an accurate channel model for the effective user channels, which facilitates our BER analysis. We then introduce a channel alignment scheme for a two-user scenario, enabling efficient SIC-based detection and deriving closed-form BER expressions. We further extend the analysis to a generalized setup with an arbitrary number of users and modulation orders for quadrature amplitude modulation signaling. Using the derived BER expressions, we develop an optimized uplink NOMA power allocation (PA) scheme that minimizes the average BER while satisfying the user transmit power constraints. It will be shown that the proposed NOMA detection scheme, in conjunction with the optimized PA strategy, eliminate SIC error floors at the base station. The theoretical BER expressions are validated using simulations, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed design in eliminating BER floors.</description>

      <title>Robust Eavesdropping in the Presence of Adversarial Communications for RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is an effective approach for performing radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which aims to identify the transmitter corresponding to received RF signals. However, beyond the intended receiver, malicious eavesdroppers can also intercept signals and attempt to fingerprint transmitters communicating over a wireless channel. Recent studies suggest that transmitters can counter such threats by embedding deep learning-based transferable adversarial attacks in their signals before transmission. In this work, we develop a time-frequency-based eavesdropper architecture that is capable of withstanding such transferable adversarial perturbations and thus able to perform effective RF fingerprinting. We theoretically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations injected by a transmitter are confined to specific time-frequency regions that are insignificant during inference, directly increasing fingerprinting accuracy on perturbed signals intercepted by the eavesdropper. Empirical evaluations on a real-world dataset validate our theoretical findings, showing that deep learning-based RF fingerprinting eavesdroppers can achieve classification performance comparable to the intended receiver, despite efforts made by the transmitter to deceive the eavesdropper. Our framework reveals that relying on transferable adversarial attacks may not be sufficient to prevent eavesdroppers from successfully fingerprinting transmissions in next-generation deep learning-based communications systems.</description>

      <title>FLAME: A Federated Learning Approach for Multi-Modal RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorization systems are increasingly relying on processing radio frequency (RF) waveforms at receivers to fingerprint (i.e., determine the identity) of the corresponding transmitter. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular paradigm to perform RF fingerprinting in networks with multiple access points (APs), as they allow effective deep learning-based device identification without requiring the centralization of locally collected RF signals stored at multiple APs. Yet, FL algorithms that operate merely on in-phase and quadrature (IQ) time samples incur high convergence rates, resulting in excessive training rounds and inefficient training times. In this work, we propose FLAME: an FL approach for multimodal RF fingerprinting. Our framework consists of simultaneously representing received RF waveforms in multiple complimentary modalities beyond IQ samples in an effort to reduce training times. We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our methodology and derive a convergence bound that incurs lower loss and thus higher accuracies in the same training round in comparison to single-modal FL-based RF fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of FLAME with with improvements of up to 30% in comparison to multiple considered baselines.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Deep Learning-Based Automatic Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be highly effective for automatic modification classification (AMC), which is a pivotal technology for next-generation cognitive communications. Yet, existing deep learning methods for AMC often lack robust mechanisms for uncertainty quantification (UQ). This limitation restricts their ability to produce accurate and reliable predictions in real-world environments, where signals can be perturbed as a result of several factors such as interference and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). To address this problem, we propose a deep ensemble approach that leverages multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate predictive distributions, as opposed to point estimates produced by standard deep learning models, which produce statistical characteristics that quantify the uncertainty associated with each prediction. We validate our approach using real-world AMC data, evaluating performance through multiple UQ metrics in a variety of signal environments. Our results show that our proposed ensemble-based framework captures uncertainty to a greater degree compared to previously proposed baselines in multiple settings, including in-distribution samples, out-of-distribution samples, and low SNR signals. These findings highlight the strong UQ capabilities of our ensemble-based AMC approach, paving the way for more robust deep learning-based AMC.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Based Alignment of EEG and Audio Signals Using Contrastive Learning and SincNet for Auditory Attention Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to focus auditory attention in complex acoustic environments, such as cocktail parties. Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) data. Existing AAD algorithms often leverage deep learning's powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities, few consider the neural mechanisms underlying auditory processing in the brain. In this paper, we propose SincAlignNet, a novel network based on an improved SincNet and contrastive learning, designed to align audio and EEG features for auditory attention detection. The SincNet component simulates the brain's processing of audio during auditory attention, while contrastive learning guides the model to learn the relationship between EEG signals and attended speech. During inference, we calculate the cosine similarity between EEG and audio features and also explore direct inference of the attended speaker using EEG data. Cross-trial evaluations results demonstrate that SincAlignNet outperforms state-of-the-art AAD methods on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU, achieving average accuracies of 78.3% and 92.2%, respectively, with a 1-second decision window. The model exhibits strong interpretability, revealing that the left and right temporal lobes are more active during both male and female speaker scenarios. Furthermore, we found that using data from only six electrodes near the temporal lobes maintains similar or even better performance compared to using 64 electrodes. These findings indicate that efficient low-density EEG online decoding is achievable, marking an important step toward the practical implementation of neuro-guided hearing aids in real-world applications.

      <title>Deep Joint CSI Estimation-Feedback-Precoding for MU-MIMO OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of antennas in frequency-division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems increases, acquiring channel state information (CSI) becomes increasingly challenging due to limited spectral resources and feedback overhead. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end network that conducts joint design with pilot design, CSI estimation, CSI feedback, and precoding design in the multi-user MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) scenario. Multiple communication modules are jointly designed and trained with a common optimization objective to prevent mismatches between modules and discrepancies between individual module objectives and the final system goal. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the same feedback and CE overheads, the proposed joint multi-module end-to-end network achieves a higher multi-user downlink spectral efficiency than traditional algorithms based on separate architecture and partially separated artificial intelligence-based network architectures under comparable channel quality. Furthermore, compared to conventional separate architecture, the proposed network architecture with joint architecture reduces the computational burden and model storage overhead at the UE side, facilitating the deployment of low-overhead multi-module joint architectures in practice. While slightly increasing storage requirements at the base station, it reduces computational complexity and precoding design delay, effectively reducing the effects of channel aging challenges.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To tackle the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper introduces an innovative SnS near-field CE framework grounded in adaptive subarray partitioning. Conventional methods relying on equal subarray partitioning often lead to suboptimal divisions, undermining CE precision. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive subarray segmentation approach. First, we develop a spherical-wave channel model customized for line-of-sight (LoS) XL-MIMO systems to capture SnS traits. Next, we define and evaluate the adverse effects of over-segmentation and under-segmentation on CE efficacy. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which merges cost-effective power measurements with a DHBF structure, enabling joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A robust partitioning algorithm, termed power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS), exploits statistical features of power profiles, while the DHBF utilizes subarray segmentation-based group time block code (SS-GTBC) to enable efficient subarray decoupling with limited radio frequency (RF) chain resources. Additionally, by utilizing angular-domain block sparsity and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV), employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebooks to lower complexity. Extensive simulation results validate the exceptional performance of the proposed framework over its counterparts.</description>

      <title>Learning Wideband User Scheduling and Hybrid Precoding with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial-frequency scheduling and hybrid precoding in wideband multi-user multi-antenna systems have never been learned jointly due to the challenges arising from the massive user combinations on resource blocks (RBs) and the shared analog precoder among RBs. In this paper, we strive to jointly learn the scheduling and precoding policies with graph neural networks (GNNs), which have emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing resource allocation thanks to their potential in generalizing across problem scales. By reformulating the joint optimization problem into an equivalent functional optimization problem for the scheduling and precoding policies, we propose a GNN-based architecture consisting of two cascaded modules to learn the two policies. We discover a same-parameter same-decision (SPSD) property for wireless policies defined on sets, revealing that a GNN cannot well learn the optimal scheduling policy when users have similar channels. This motivates us to develop a sequence of GNNs to enhance the scheduling module. Furthermore, by analyzing the SPSD property, we find when linear aggregators in GNNs impede size generalization. Based on the observation, we devise a novel attention mechanism for information aggregation in the precoder module. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves satisfactory spectral efficiency with short inference time and low training complexity, and is generalizable to the numbers of users, RBs, and antennas at the base station and users.</description>

      <title>On the Connection Between Magnetic-Field Odometry Aided Inertial Navigation and Magnetic-Field SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using consumer-grade inertial and magnetometer sensors offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor localization. However, the rapid error accumulation in the inertial navigation process limits the feasible exploratory phases of these systems. Advances in magnetometer array processing have demonstrated that odometry information, i.e., displacement and rotation information, can be extracted from local magnetic field variations and used to create magnetic-field odometry-aided inertial navigation systems. The error growth rate of these systems is significantly lower than that of standalone inertial navigation systems. This study seeks an answer to whether a magnetic-field SLAM system fed with measurements from a magnetometer array can indirectly extract odometry information -- without requiring algorithmic modifications -- and thus sustain longer exploratory phases. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that such a system can extract odometry information and indirectly create a magnetic field odometry-aided inertial navigation system during the exploration phases. However, practical challenges related to map resolution and computational complexity remain significant.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity Function Analysis and Optimization of Frequency-Hopping MIMO Radar with Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-enabled frequency-hopping (FH) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system and investigate its sensing resolution. Specifically, we derive the expression of the ambiguity function and analyze the relationship between its main lobe width and the transmit antenna positions. In particular, the optimal antenna distribution to achieve the minimum main lobe width in the angular domain is characterized. We discover that this minimum width is related to the antenna size, the antenna number, and the target angle. Meanwhile, we present lower bounds of the ambiguity function in the Doppler and delay domains, and show that the impact of the antenna size on the radar performance in these two domains is very different from that in the angular domain. Moreover, the performance enhancement brought by MAs exhibits a certain trade-off between the main lobe width and the side lobe peak levels. Therefore, we propose to balance between minimizing the side lobe levels and narrowing the main lobe of the ambiguity function by optimizing the antenna positions. To achieve this goal, we propose a low-complexity algorithm based on the Rosen's gradient projection method, and show that its performance is very close to the baseline. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis on the properties of the ambiguity function, and demonstrate that MAs can reduce the main lobe width and suppress the side lobe levels of the ambiguity function, thereby enhancing radar performance.</description>

      <title>Precoder Learning for Weighted Sum Rate Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) for precoder optimization effectively balances performance and fairness among users. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning in precoder optimization for sum rate maximization. However, the WSRM problem necessitates a redesign of neural network architectures to incorporate user weights into the input. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) to learn the precoder for WSRM. Compared to existing DNNs, the proposed DNN leverage the joint unitary and permutation equivariant property inherent in the optimal precoding policy, effectively enhancing learning performance while reducing training complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline learning methods in terms of both learning and generalization performance while maintaining low training and inference complexity.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Complex Baseband Signals via M-Periodic Nonuniform Bandpass Sampling and Least-Squares Optimal Time-Varying FIR Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the reconstruction of digital complex baseband signals from M-periodically nonuniformly sampled real bandpass signals. With such a sampling, bandpass signals with arbitrary frequency locations can be sampled and reconstructed, as opposed to uniform sampling which requires the signal to be within one of the Nyquist bands. It is shown how the reconstruction can be carried out via an M-periodic time-varying finite-length impulse response (FIR) filter or, equivalently, a set of M time-invariant FIR filters. Then, a least-squares design method is proposed in which the M filter impulse responses are computed in closed form. This offers minimal filter orders for a given desired bandwidth. This is an advantage over an existing technique where ideal filters are first derived (ensuring perfect reconstruction) and then windowed and truncated, which leads to suboptimal filters and thus higher filter orders and implementation complexity. A design example illustrates the efficiency of the proposed design technique.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Deceptive Wireless Beamforming Against Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eavesdroppers of wireless signals want to infer as much as possible regarding the transmitter (Tx). Popular methods to minimize information leakage to the eavesdropper include covert communication, directional modulation, and beamforming with nulling. In this paper we do not attempt to prevent information leakage to the eavesdropper like the previous methods. Instead we propose to beamform the wireless signal at the Tx in such a way that it incorporates deceptive information. The beamformed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal includes a deceptive value for the Doppler (velocity) and range of the Tx. To design the optimal baseband waveform with these characteristics, we define and solve an optimization problem for power-efficient deceptive wireless beamforming (DWB). The relaxed convex Quadratic Program (QP) is solved using a heuristic algorithm. Our simulation results indicate that our DWB scheme can successfully inject deceptive information with low power consumption, while preserving the shape of the created beam.</description>

      <title>Mixed Near-field and Far-field Target Localization for Low-altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient mixed near-field and far-field target localization methods for low-altitude economy, by capitalizing on extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication systems. Compared with existing works, we address three new challenges in localization, arising from 1) half-wavelength antenna spacing constraint, 2) hybrid uniform planar array (UPA) architecture, and 3) incorrect mixed-field target classification for near-field targets.To address these issues, we propose a new three-step mixed-field localization method.First, we reconstruct the signals received at UPA antennas by judiciously designing analog combining matrices over time with minimum recovery errors, thus tackling the reduced-dimensional signal-space issue in hybrid arrays.Second, based on recovered signals, we devise a modified MUSIC algorithm (catered to UPA architecture) to estimate 2D angular parameters of both far- and near-field targets. Due to half-wavelength inter-antenna spacing, there exist ambiguous angles when estimating true angles of targets.In the third step, we design an effective classification method to distinguish mixed-field targets, determine true angles of all targets, as well as estimate the ranges of near-field targets. In particular, angular ambiguity is resolved by showing an important fact that the three types of estimated angles (i.e., far-field, near-field, and ambiguous angles) exhibit significantly different patterns in the range-domain MUSIC spectrum. Furthermore, to characterize the estimation error lower-bound, we obtain a matrix closed-form Cram\'er-Rao bounds for mixed-field target localization. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mixed-field localization method, which improves target-classification accuracy and achieves a lower root mean square error than various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model-based Compression of MIMO CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While neural lossy compression techniques have markedly advanced the efficiency of Channel State Information (CSI) compression and reconstruction for feedback in MIMO communications, efficient algorithms for more challenging and practical tasks-such as CSI compression for future channel prediction and reconstruction with relevant side information-remain underexplored, often resulting in suboptimal performance when existing methods are extended to these scenarios. To that end, we propose a novel framework for compression with side information, featuring an encoding process with fixed-rate compression using a trainable codebook for codeword quantization, and a decoding procedure modeled as a backward diffusion process conditioned on both the codeword and the side information. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing CSI compression algorithms, often yielding over twofold performance improvement by achieving comparable distortion at less than half the data rate of competing methods in certain scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based compression for practical deployment in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for ISAC Systems with Suppressed Range-Angle Sidelobes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a pivotal advancement for future wireless networks. This paper introduces a novel ISAC beamforming method for enhancing sensing performance while preserving communication quality by leveraging the ambiguity function (AF). We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of the AF subject to the constraints of transmission power, communication signalto-interference-plus-noise ratio, and sensing gain. To address the non-convexity of the optimization problem, semidefinite relaxation is adopted. Numerical results show that our method significantly reduces range sidelobes and achieves a lower ISLR in the rangeangle domain compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology for future wireless networks, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) through the dynamic configuration of antennas in response to propagation environment variations. The integration of fluid antennas (FAs) with multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks promises substantial weighted sum rate (WSR) gains via joint beamforming and FA position optimization. However, the joint design is challenging due to the strong coupling between beamforming matrices and antenna positions. To address the challenge, we propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method in FA-assisted MU-MIMO networks. Specifically, we first employ matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we solve the reformulated problem following the BCA principle, where we develop a low-complexity majorization maximization algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simultaneously. To further reduce the computational, storage, and interconnection costs, we propose a decentralized implementation for our proposed algorithm by utilizing the decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that with our proposed algorithm, the FA-assisted MU-MIMO system achieves up to a 47% WSR improvement over conventional MIMO networks equipped with fixed-position antennas. Moreover, the decentralized implementation reduces computation time by approximately 70% and has similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Port Selection and Beamforming Design for Integrated Data and Energy Transfer Assisted by Fluid Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is considered as a key enabler of 6G, as it can provide both wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless data transfer (WDT) services towards low power devices. Thanks to the extra degree of freedom provided by fluid antenna (FA), incorporating FA into IDET systems presents a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency performance. This paper investigates a FA assisted IDET system, where the transmitter is equipped with multiple FAs and transmits wireless signals to the data receiver (DR) and the energy receiver (ER), which are both equipped with a single traditional antenna. The switching delay and energy consumption induced by port selection are taken into account in IDET system for the first time. We aim to obtain the optimal beamforming vector and the port selection strategy at the transmitter, in order to maximize the short-term and long-term WET efficiency, respectively. The instant sub-optimal solution is obtained by alternatively optimizing the beamforming vector and port selection in each transmission frame, while a novel constrained soft actor critic (C-SAC) algorithm is proposed to find the feasible policy of port selection from the long-term perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve greater gain in terms of both the short-term and long-term WET efficiency compared to other benchmarks, while not degrading WDT performance.</description>

      <title>Personalized Emotion Detection from Floor Vibrations Induced by Footsteps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is critical for various applications such as early detection of mental health disorders and emotion based smart home systems. Previous studies used various sensing methods for emotion recognition, such as wearable sensors, cameras, and microphones. However, these methods have limitations in long term domestic, including intrusiveness and privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a nonintrusive and privacy friendly personalized emotion recognition system, EmotionVibe, which leverages footstep induced floor vibrations for emotion recognition. The main idea of EmotionVibe is that individuals' emotional states influence their gait patterns, subsequently affecting the floor vibrations induced by their footsteps. However, there are two main research challenges: 1) the complex and indirect relationship between human emotions and footstep induced floor vibrations and 2) the large between person variations within the relationship between emotions and gait patterns. To address these challenges, we first empirically characterize this complex relationship and develop an emotion sensitive feature set including gait related and vibration related features from footstep induced floor vibrations. Furthermore, we personalize the emotion recognition system for each user by calculating gait similarities between the target person (i.e., the person whose emotions we aim to recognize) and those in the training dataset and assigning greater weights to training people with similar gait patterns in the loss function. We evaluated our system in a real-world walking experiment with 20 participants, summing up to 37,001 footstep samples. EmotionVibe achieved the mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.11 and 1.07 for valence and arousal score estimations, respectively, reflecting 19.0% and 25.7% error reduction compared to the baseline method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present an overview of various kinds of interference, that arise in the Orthogonal Frequency-Domain Multiplexing (OFDM)-based digital communications systems at the physical layer. Inter-symbol, inter-block, inter-carrier interference types are described in detail, valid for any OFDM transmission, along with Inter-cell interference specific to cellular networks. A survey of various communication disruptions techniques is presented - primarily focusing on intentional interference - jamming. Furthermore, we present a survey of modulation techniques that expand on the OFDM and may be considered viable candidates for modulation in the future 6G cellular networks.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Scalable UE-AP Association in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO based on Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of access point (AP) and user equipment (UE) association in cell-free massive MIMO networks. It introduces a deep learning algorithm leveraging Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory cells and a hybrid probabilistic methodology for weight updating. This approach enhances scalability by adapting to variations in the number of UEs without requiring retraining. Additionally, the study presents a training methodology that improves scalability not only with respect to the number of UEs but also to the number of APs. Furthermore, a variant of the proposed AP-UE algorithm ensures robustness against pilot contamination effects, a critical issue arising from pilot reuse in channel estimation. Extensive numerical results validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superiority over widely used heuristic alternatives.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared laser chaos lidar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos lidars detect targets through the cross-correlation between the back-scattered chaos signal from the target and the local reference one. Chaos lidars have excellent anti-jamming and anti-interference capabilities, owing to the random nature of chaotic oscillations. However, most chaos lidars operate in the near-infrared spectral regime, where the atmospheric attenuation is significant. Here we show a mid-infrared chaos lidar, which is suitable for long-reach ranging and imaging applications within the low-loss transmission window of the atmosphere. The proof-of-concept mid-infrared chaos lidar utilizes an interband cascade laser with optical feedback as the laser chaos source. Experimental results reveal that the chaos lidar achieves an accuracy better than 0.9 cm and a precision better than 0.3 cm for ranging distances up to 300 cm. In addition, it is found that a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of only 1 dB is required to sustain both sub-cm accuracy and sub-cm precision. This work paves the way for developing remote chaos lidar systems in the mid-infrared spectral regime.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Intelligent Sensing: A Source-Channel Tradeoff and Its Application to Coding Rate Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is set to merge edge artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) extensively, giving rise to the new paradigm of edge intelligent sensing (EI-Sense). This paradigm leverages ubiquitous edge devices for environmental sensing and deploys AI algorithms at edge servers to interpret the observations via remote inference on wirelessly uploaded features. A significant challenge arises in designing EI-Sense systems for 6G mission-critical applications, which demand high performance under stringent latency constraints. To tackle this challenge, we focus on the end-to-end (E2E) performance of EI-Sense and characterize a source-channel tradeoff that balances source distortion and channel reliability. In this work, we establish a theoretical foundation for the source-channel tradeoff by quantifying the effects of source coding on feature discriminant gains and channel reliability on packet loss. Building on this foundation, we design the coding rate control by optimizing the tradeoff to minimize the E2E sensing error probability, leading to a low-complexity algorithm for ultra-low-latency EI-Sense. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis and proposed coding rate control algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the sensing performance gain of our approach with respect to traditional reliability-centric methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the precoder design for user-centric network (UCN) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink with matrix manifold optimization. In UCN mMIMO systems, each user terminal (UT) is served by a subset of base stations (BSs) instead of all the BSs, facilitating the implementation of the system and lowering the dimension of the precoders to be designed. By proving that the precoder set satisfying the per-BS power constraints forms a Riemannian submanifold of a linear product manifold, we transform the constrained precoder design problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained one on the Riemannian submanifold. Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, retraction and vector transport, of the problem on the Riemannian submanifold are further derived, with which the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) design method is proposed for solving the unconstrained problem. The proposed method avoids the inverses of large dimensional matrices, which is beneficial in practice. The complexity analyses show the high computational efficiency of RCG precoder design. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical superiority of the proposed precoder design and the high efficiency of the UCN mMIMO system.</description>

Abstract: An increase in availability of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) has caused a dramatic shift in the threat landscape of legacy satellite systems, opening them up to easy spoofing attacks by low-budget adversaries. Physical-layer authentication methods can help improve the security of these systems by providing additional validation without modifying the space segment. This paper extends previous research on Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) of satellite communication to the Orbcomm satellite formation. The GPS and Iridium constellations are already well covered in prior research, but the feasibility of transferring techniques to other formations has not yet been examined, and raises previously undiscussed challenges.
  In this paper, we collect a novel dataset containing 8992474 packets from the Orbcom satellite constellation using different SDRs and locations. We use this dataset to train RFF systems based on convolutional neural networks. We achieve an ROC AUC score of 0.53 when distinguishing different satellites within the constellation, and 0.98 when distinguishing legitimate satellites from SDRs in a spoofing scenario. We also demonstrate the possibility of mixing datasets using different SDRs in different physical locations.</description>

      <title>Autonomous RISs and Oblivious Base Stations: The Observer Effect and its Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional onboard hardware to monitor the propagation environment and perform local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices sharing the environment. Although implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RIS, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies the fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges collectively. In particular, we examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system by considering its critical components and stringent conditions. The latter include: (a) two extremes of implementation complexity, represented by minimalist operation designs of two distinct HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We present empirical evidence that autonomous RISs remain promising under stringent conditions and outline research directions to deepen probe distortion understanding.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Kalman Smoothing Using Orthogonal Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerically-stable parallel-in-time linear Kalman smoother. The smoother uses a novel highly-parallel QR factorization for a class of structured sparse matrices for state estimation, and an adaptation of the SelInv selective-inversion algorithm to evaluate the covariance matrices of estimated states. Our implementation of the new algorithm, using the Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library, scales well on both Intel and ARM multi-core servers, achieving speedups of up to 47x on 64 cores. The algorithm performs more arithmetic than sequential smoothers; consequently it is 1.8x to 2.5x slower on a single core. The new algorithm is faster and scales better than the parallel Kalman smoother proposed by S\"arkk\"a and Garc\'{\i}a-Fern\'andez in 2021.</description>
