      <title>Miscalibration of simulations: A comment on Luebbert and Pachter: 'Miscalibration of the honeybee odometer' arXiv:2405.12998v1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this commentary I review the claim by Luebbert and Pachter (arXiv:2405.12998v1) that the reported R-Squared value in Srinivasan et al. (Science, 287(5454):851-853, 2000), describing the relationship between distance to a food source and mean waggle duration of honeybee dances, was too high to be consistent with the reported means and standard deviations in the latter study. There is one serious limitation of the simulations conducted by Luebbert and Pachter, and two flaws that compromise their findings. The reported R-squared value of Srinivasan. et al. is within the expected range, as far as that can be determined given the limitations of the available data.</description>

      <title>DOME Registry: Implementing community-wide recommendations for reporting supervised machine learning in biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning (ML) is used extensively in biology and deserves closer scrutiny. The DOME recommendations aim to enhance the validation and reproducibility of ML research by establishing standards for key aspects such as data handling and processing, optimization, evaluation, and model interpretability. The recommendations help to ensure that key details are reported transparently by providing a structured set of questions. Here, we introduce the DOME Registry (URL: registry.dome-ml.org), a database that allows scientists to manage and access comprehensive DOME-related information on published ML studies. The registry uses external resources like ORCID, APICURON and the Data Stewardship Wizard to streamline the annotation process and ensure comprehensive documentation. By assigning unique identifiers and DOME scores to publications, the registry fosters a standardized evaluation of ML methods. Future plans include continuing to grow the registry through community curation, improving the DOME score definition and encouraging publishers to adopt DOME standards, promoting transparency and reproducibility of ML in the life sciences.</description>
