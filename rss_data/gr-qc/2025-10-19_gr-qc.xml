      <title>The Missing Multipole Problem: Investigating biases from model starting frequency in gravitational-wave analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our ability to infer the true source properties of colliding black holes from gravitational wave observations requires not only accurate waveform models but also their correct use. A key property when evaluating time-domain models is when to start the waveform: choosing a time that is too late can omit low-frequency power from higher order multipoles. By focusing on binary systems with total mass $\ge 200 \, M_{\odot}$, we show that current detectors are sensitive to this missing power and biased source properties can be obtained. We show that for systems with total mass $\lesssim 300 \, M_{\odot}$, mass ratio $\gtrsim 0.33$, and signal-to-noise ratio $\rho \gtrsim 20$, templates starting at $20 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased source properties. As the total mass increases, and the component masses become more asymmetric, templates starting from $13 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased properties. If the gravitational-wave signal is observed at signal-to-noise ratio $\rho &lt; 20$, time-domain models can start from $20\, \mathrm{Hz}$ as statistical uncertainties dominate.</description>

      <title>Hints for dynamical dark energy from warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of dissipation from the thermal bath of minimal warm inflation (MWI) on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is investigated. A shift in the phase and peaks of the theoretical TT mode angular power spectrum of CMB for MWI with increasing dissipation strength hints at the dynamical nature of dark energy from warm inflation. Outcome of the study highlights the necessity of modifying the cosmological parameters, signalling a physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. The current findings may open a new direction for explaining the increased expansion rate in the early universe, thus alleviating some of the persistent tensions in cosmology, especially the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The exponential metric: traversable wormhole and possible identification of scalar background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static antiscalar solution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in the form of the Papapetrou exponential metric had been interpreted as a traversable wormhole with a throat at \textit{r=M}. We aim to search for the effects which could be associated with this scale and only find that the topological Gauss-Bonnet invariant swaps sign, and the value of the Keplerian frequency for circular geodesics becomes singular. At the same time, the geometric invariants of the curvature tensor have extremal values at the scale twice less than that of the throat, revealing new physical effects. In particular, the Ricci scalar at \textit{r=M/2} (rather than \textit{r=M}) is associated with the extremal values of thermodynamic characteristics of the scalar background. This approach in combination with the antiscalar static limit of the Einstein-Maxwell equations suggests the interpretation of the scalar background as a stable medium with a stiff equation of state, formed by the neutral superposition of ambient quasistatic electric fields.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Dark Matter Bosonic Stars in regularized 4D Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have constructed anisotropic bosonic dark-matter star (DMS) solutions in the context of a regularized four-dimensional Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity theory. Using dimensional regularization, we solve modified Tolman$-$Oppenheimer$-$Volkoff equations for a self-interacting complex scalar field in the dilute polytropic regime, $p_r = K \rho^2$, with anisotropy parameterized as $\sigma = \beta\, p_r \left( 1 - e^{-2\lambda} \right)$. We perform a comprehensive numerical analysis across the \((\alpha,\beta)\) parameter domain, where \(\alpha \in [0,8]~\mathrm{km}^2\) and \(\beta \in [-2,0]\), to examine mass$-$radius relations and evaluate multiple stability indicators including static equilibrium \(dM/dp_c\), sound-speed causality, the radial adiabatic index \(\Gamma_r\), and energy conditions. Positive Gauss$-$Bonnet coupling enhances both the maximum mass and compactness (e.g., \(M_{\rm max} \approx 1.62\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha=0\) rising to \(\approx 2.09\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha = 8~\mathrm{km}^2\)), while negative anisotropy reduces them (e.g., from \(\approx 2.21\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta=0\) to \(\approx 1.73\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta = -2\)). The resulting configurations remain statically stable up to the mass peak and satisfy physical criteria. This work extends previous isotropic boson-star analyses by systematically incorporating anisotropy within a regularized 4D EGB framework. These findings provide observationally relevant predictions for compact dark-matter objects under modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Signals from Fermionic inflationary cosmology with Yukawa interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an inflationary model wherein the Dirac field $\psi$ is directly coupled to a scalar inflaton $\phi$ via a Yukawa interaction $g\phi\bar\psi\psi$ and examine the resulting observational implications. Within the slow-roll approximation, we derive analytical solutions of the Dirac equations during inflation. The analytical result on the fermion pair density $\langle n\rangle$ indicates that the Yukawa interaction strength $g$ is to characterize the degree of non-adiabaticity. For large value of the dimensionless effective mass $\tilde m=(m+g\phi)/H$, i.e. $\tilde m\gtrsim 1$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is suppressed by a factor of approximately $1/(1+2.95\pi^2g^2)$. This condition is also characterized by a significant backreaction. Conversely, if $\tilde m \ll 1$, the value of $r$ remains consistent with that observed in standard cold inflation. Our analysis is performed under the assumption of the highest inflationary energy scales compatible with current observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves by black holes in quasi-topological gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider massless scalar field perturbations of regular black holes in quasi-topological gravity. After reviewing various regular black hole solutions, we compute the total absorption cross-section and the partial absorption cross-section for different choices of the parameters using the partial wave method. The results show that the larger the parameter ${\alpha}$, introduced in the context of quasi-topological gravity, the smaller the total absorption cross-section. In addition, we find that the influence of the space-time dimension ${D}$ on the absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves in this set of regular black holes differs from earlier computations.</description>

      <title>Geodesic structure of a noncommutative black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the metric of Piero Nicolini's noncommutative black hole spacetime, calculates its effective potential, and presents the corresponding potential curve. By analyzing this curve, we identify various orbit types for test particles and photons in this spacetime. Using the dynamical equations for particles and photons near the black hole, we plot the specific time-like and null geodesic structures. We analyze the impact of different values of the total mass of the source $M$ and angular momentum $L$ on time-like geodesics. Our results indicate that in the Piero black hole spacetime, increases in total mass and angular momentum reduce the perihelion precession rate of the orbit. Notably, the effect of total mass is nonlinear, while the effect of angular momentum is linear.</description>

      <title>Relativistic tidal divergences in circular orbits and the dynamics of light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal forces acting on orbiting bodies arise from inhomogeneities in the gravitational field, generating stresses that can deform or even disrupt these objects. In this work, we analyze relativistic tidal forces associated with ultracompact objects described by static and spherically symmetric spacetimes, focusing on observers in circular geodesic motion. We show that, in contrast to the case of radial geodesics, tidal forces diverge as the orbit approaches null circular geodesics. As illustrative examples, we study two uniform-density stellar models: one isotropic and another supported purely by tangential stresses. We conjecture that the divergence of tidal forces near light rings may play a role in the nonlinear stability of ultracompact, horizonless objects.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields with power-law potentials in quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A homogeneous and isotropic quantum cosmological system (universe) initially filled with a uniform scalar field that has a potential in the power law representation is considered. Depending on the epoch, this scalar field yields barotropic matter in the form of stiff matter, perfect gas, radiation, dust, cosmic strings, domain walls, de Sitter vacuum, or phantom matter. The proposed approach is based on quantum geometrodynamics for the maximally symmetric space. The relevant differential equations for the separate power-law summands of the scalar field potential and the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian constraint equations, which describe the universe that can be viewed as dominated by one form or another of barotropic matter, were obtained. The solutions to these equations have been found in analytical form.</description>

      <title>Unified field theory from Hamilton cotangent bundle geometry - The Einstein-Maxwell system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unification of all physical fields into one mathematical object and the derivation of all physical field equations from that object in one framework is a long-lasting endeavor in fundamental physics. We suggest a new approach to achieve this goal by encoding physical fields into the geometry of the 1-particle phase space on spacetime (the cotangent bundle) through Hamilton geometry. The fundamental field, which contains information about all physical fields in spacetime and defines the phase space geometry, is a scalar field in phase space that is interpreted as a point-particle Hamiltonian. We construct an action principle for scalar fields in phase space and derive the corresponding scalar field equation. By choosing a specific scalar field, namely the Hamiltonian describing a charged particle in curved spacetime with an electromagnetic field, we show that this phase-space scalar field equation is equivalent to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations in spacetime, thus providing a geometric unification of gravity and electromagnetism. We further discuss how this approach differs from previous unification attempts and its potential for describing further physical fields and their dynamics in a unified manner in terms of phase-space geometry.</description>

      <title>Aiming for Proxima Centauri b: Gravitational effects on relativistic spacecraft trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How important are gravitational and relativistic effects for interstellar travel? We consider this question in the context of proposed laser-propelled spacecraft missions to neighboring stellar destinations. Our analysis applies to any spacecraft traveling at relativistic speeds. As a concrete example, we focus on a mission to Proxima Centauri b -- a terrestrial-sized planet in the habitable zone around our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri. We employ a Julia reimplementation of the PoMiN code, an N-body code modeling relativistic gravitational dynamics in the first post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation to general relativity (valid to linear order in Newton's constant $G$). We compute the gravitational influence of seven different celestial bodies and find that the Sun has the greatest influence on the trajectory of the interstellar spacecraft. We also study the differences between Newtonian and PM gravity, and find that if mission planners wish to hit Proxima Centauri b with an accuracy of better than about 690,000 kilometers, relativistic effects must be taken into account. To solve for the precise initial data needed to hit an intended target, we develop numerical fine-tuning methods and demonstrate that these methods can (within a given model) be precise to about a femtometer over a travel distance of $\sim4.25$ light years. However, we find that for the spacecraft trajectories we consider, higher order general relativistic effects (beyond the first PM approximation) from the Sun can displace the final position of the spacecraft by tens of kilometers. We also consider the variation in the initial direction of the spacecraft velocity and find that, even with relativistic effects properly taken into account, the miss distances can be dominated by the variation in the initial velocity that could arise from errors during the launch and boost phase of the spacecraft mission.</description>

      <title>Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</description>

      <title>Atomic Quantum Sensors for High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves represent an unexplored frontier of gravitational physics. While pulsar timing arrays reach nHz frequencies and ground-based interferometers probe the audio band, the regime above the MHz scale remains essentially untested. We propose a hybrid detection framework in which gravitons convert to photons via the Gertsenshtein effect in strong magnetic fields; the resulting electromagnetic signal is resonantly enhanced in a cavity and read out by atomic quantum sensors. Our approach combines multiple channels, including long-coherence Raman interferometry in alkali atoms, microwave Rydberg transitions, photoionization-based detection, and inner-shell electronic resonances. We derive the graviton-photon conversion probability, compute the induced photon flux, and estimate the shot-noise-limited spectral strain noise density. Depending on configuration, the projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity ranges from $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-22}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in conservative microwave implementations to $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-37}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in aggressive optical Raman schemes, potentially surpassing the cosmological bound from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for stochastic backgrounds, while coherent bursts remain unconstrained and detectable. Such reach allows to test scenarios involving primordial black holes, topological defects, violent phase transitions, and (p)reheating, motivating advances in high-$Q$ cavities, strong-field magnets, and quantum-limited atomic sensors, with broad impact across quantum metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Taming the plunge: A circularization trap of supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening. We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$): migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates $\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy, $\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$), eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e \approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping, the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear. Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in cosmological frameworks.</description>

      <title>Effects of Radiative Corrections on Starobinsky Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze radiative corrections to the Starobinsky model of inflation arising from self-interactions of the inflaton, and from its Yukawa couplings, $y$, to matter fermions, and dimensionful trilinear couplings, $\kappa$, to scalar fields, which could be responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation. The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in the Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB observations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can have significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations, $n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group improved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the Planck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions in the Einstein frame: $y &lt; 4.5 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper limit on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, whereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \times 10^{-4} &lt; y &lt; 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{11} ~{\rm GeV} &lt; T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker constraints. Planck data also imply a constraint on a trilinear inflaton coupling to light scalars in the Einstein frame: $\kappa \leq 4 \times 10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$, corresponding to $T_{\rm RH} \leq 4.2 \times 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$. We further present constraints on inflaton couplings to massive fermions and scalars, and analyze constraints on couplings in the Jordan frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the diffusion method employed in fundamentally nonlocal field theories to determine the number of initial conditions for the classicized dynamics of unitary field theories with fakeons, characterized by inverse powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$. We show that this number is two and we recover all the results obtained with a direct calculation elsewhere, including explicit solutions of linear toy models. Possible applications to nonlocal gravity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Boundary Conditions for the qBounce Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrepancies between theory and recent qBounce data have prompted renewed scrutiny of how boundary conditions are implemented for ultracold neutrons bouncing above a mirror in Earth's gravity. We apply the theory of self-adjoint extensions to the linear gravitational potential on the half-line and derive the most general boundary condition that renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. This introduces a single real self-adjoint parameter $\lambda$ that continuously interpolates between the Dirichlet case and more general (Robin-type) reflecting surfaces.
  Building on this framework, we provide analytical expressions for the energy spectrum, eigenfunctions, relevant matrix elements, and a set of sum rules valid for arbitrary $\lambda$. We show how nontrivial boundary conditions can bias measurements of $g$ and can mimic or mask putative short-range ''fifth-force''. Our results emphasize that enforcing self-adjointness-and modeling the correct boundary physics-is essential for quantitative predictions in gravitational quantum states. Beyond neutron quantum bounces, the approach is broadly applicable to systems where boundaries and self-adjointness govern the observable spectra and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections in the Low-Temperature Fluid/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational-wave lensing posterior odds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple "images": repeated copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival time, and overall "Morse phase." The literature identifies two separate approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known "birthday problem", namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing detection.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic constraints in quantum gravity and cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we review results on quantum information constraints in gravity that are relevant to cosmological models and demonstrate how this approach sheds light on cosmological holography. Using Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity as a toy model, we establish the validity of the quantum Bousso bound and prove the restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC), which is a central assumption in semiclassical gravity and holography. Interestingly, we find violations of the original QFC in this model. Building on these results, we introduce a covariant prescription for computing holographic entanglement entropy in the static patch holography description of de Sitter space and explore a generalization to closed FLRW spacetimes. This leads us to a formulation of subregion-subregion duality, where entanglement between complementary holographic theories gives rise to bulk connectivity. Causality considerations imply that entanglement wedges are bounded by surfaces that are not extremal in the usual sense, but instead satisfy an extremization with constraint. Finally, we discuss the connected wedge theorem, which establishes a relation between the causal structure of spacetime and information-theoretic constraints in the holographic dual. We argue that maintaining the consistency of static patch holography with this theorem leads to constraints on the causal structure of the dual theory. Our results suggest a novel relationship between static patch holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>From Localization to Discovery: Bayesian Ranking of Electromagnetic Counterparts to Gravitational-Wave Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event. We present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to GW events using only location information. The framework combines three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\,4993 as the host. The approach is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Gravitational Potential and Time Dilation from Non-interacting Systems Coupled to a Global Quantum Clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational back-reaction within the Page-Wootters formulation of quantum mechanics by treating time as a quantum degree of freedom. Our model introduces a distinction between global coordinate time, represented as a relational quantum observable, and proper time, measured by internal quantum degrees of freedom of physical systems. By coupling mass-energy with coordinate time through a Wheeler-DeWitt-like constraint, we demonstrate the natural emergence of gravitational time dilation. In the presence of a massive object this agrees with time dilation in a Schwarzchild metric at leading order if the interaction strength is taken to be representative of the gravitational coupling $G$. Additionally, when two particles independently couple to the time coordinate, a Newtonian gravitational interaction arises in the low-energy limit, showing how gravitational potential can emerge from non-interacting quantum systems. Our approach also reveals renormalization features, potentially softening high-energy divergences and suggesting that particles in superposition might introduce quantum corrections to gravitational time dilation.</description>

      <title>General relativistic hydrodynamics code for dynamical spacetimes with curvilinear coordinates, tabulated equations of state, and neutrino physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many astrophysical systems of interest to numerical relativity-such as rapidly rotating stars, black hole accretion disks, and core-collapse supernovae-exhibit near-symmetries. These systems generally consist of a strongly gravitating central object surrounded by an accretion disk, debris, and ejecta. Simulations can efficiently exploit the near-axisymmetry of these systems by reducing the number of points in the angular direction around the near-symmetry axis, enabling efficient simulations over seconds-long timescales with minimal computational expense. In this paper, we introduce GRoovy, a novel code capable of modeling astrophysical systems containing compact objects by solving the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) in full general relativity using singular curvilinear (spherical-like and cylindrical-like) and Cartesian coordinates. We demonstrate the code's robustness through a battery of challenging GRHD tests, ranging from flat, static spacetimes to curved, dynamical spacetimes. These tests further showcase the code's capabilities in modeling systems with realistic, finite-temperature equations of state and neutrino cooling via a leakage scheme. GRoovy extensively leverages GRHayL, an open-source, modular, and infrastructure-agnostic general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics library built from the highly robust algorithms of IllinoisGRMHD. Long-term simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star post-merger remnants will benefit greatly from using a future Charm++-parallelized version of GRoovy to study phenomena such as remnant stability, gamma-ray bursts, and nucleosynthesis.</description>

Abstract: The equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic self-gravitating fluids are computed using the extended Hartle structure equations, including anisotropic effects, derived in our previous paper. We focus on the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-star, whose anisotropic pressure follows a fully covariant equation of state (EoS), while a standard polytrope describes the radial pressure. We determine surface and integral properties, such as the moment of inertia, mass change, mass quadrupole moment, and ellipticity. Notably, for certain values of the compactness parameter, highly anisotropic $\mathcal{C}$-stars exhibit a prolate shape rather than the typical oblate form, an intriguing behavior also observed in other anisotropic systems like Bowers-Liang spheres and stars governed by a quasi-local EoS. Although the $\mathcal{C}$-stars considered in this study are limited by stability criteria and cannot sustain compactness beyond $M/R\approx0.38$, we found indications that certain rotational perturbations exhibit similarities to those observed in other ultracompact systems approaching the black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Gray-Body Factors for Gravitational Perturbations in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum-corrected black hole model arising from gravitational collapse in the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity was recently proposed in [A. Bonanno, D. Malafarina, A. Panassiti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 031401 (2024)]. Quantum correction becomes considerable for Planck-scale black holes and strongly deviates from the Schwarzschild solution near the event horizon, quickly merging with the Schwarzschild metric in the far region. While quasinormal modes and gray-body factors have been analyzed for test fields in this background, no such analysis has yet been performed for gravitational perturbations. In this work, we study axial gravitational perturbations of these black holes by modeling the effective quantum corrections through an anisotropic fluid energy-momentum tensor. We compute both quasinormal modes and gray-body factors, and show that quantum corrections enhance the quality factor of the oscillations, thereby making the quantum-corrected black hole a more efficient gravitational wave emitter. At asymptotically late times, the power-law decay is indistinguishable from Price's tails, which behave as \( \sim t^{-(2\ell + 3)} \), where \( \ell \) is the multipole number. We also demonstrate that quantum corrections lead to a suppression of the gray-body factors and examine the validity of the correspondence between gray-body factors and quasinormal modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an overview of the main results from our two companion papers that are relevant for observational constraints on interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We provide analytical solutions for the dark matter and dark energy densities, $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$, as well as the normalized Hubble function $h(z)$, for eight IDE models. These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.</description>

Abstract: We argue that a high pressure phase transition of relativistic matter to a state with negative energy density, which leads to the formation of horizonless black hole mimickers, can also give rise to the appearance of ``little red dots''. The energy source for the dots is the release of latent energy from the phase transition, and their redness is a result of this release taking place in a central region of exponentially small positive $g_{00}$, and hence very high gravitational redshift.</description>

      <title>Particles with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime: analytic solutions for eccentric orbits and homoclinic motion near the equatorial plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of analytic solutions for the nearly-equatorial motion of a test particle with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime. We solve the equations of motion up to linear order in the small body's spin for periodic and homoclinic orbits. At zero order, the particle moves along equatorial geodesics. The spin-curvature force introduces post-geodesic corrections which, for generic spin orientations, cause the precession of the orbital plane. We derive the solutions for eccentric orbits in terms of Legendre elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions for generic referential geodesics (known as ``spin gauges"). Our analytical solutions perfectly match the numerical trajectories obtained by Drummond and Hughes in Phys. Rev. D 105, 124041 (2022), and Piovano et al. in Phys. Rev. D 111, 044009 (2025). Furthermore, we present, for the first time, the solutions for homoclinic orbits for a spinning particle in Kerr spacetime, and the spin-corrections to the location of the separatrix. The homoclinic trajectories are described in closed form using elementary functions. Finally, we introduce a novel parametrization for the motion of a spinning particle, called ``fixed eccentricity spin gauge". This is the only spin gauge in which the corrections to periodic orbits are finite at the geodesic separatrix, and continuously reduce to the last stable orbits under appropriate limits. Our results will be useful for modeling the inspiral and transition-to-plunge phases of asymmetric mass binaries within the two-time-scale framework.</description>

      <title>Toward a unified view of agnostic parametrizations for deformed black holes</title>

Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity. In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>AdS black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00218v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two novel analytic AdS black hole solutions in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with two scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity. Our solutions contain two arbitrary integration constants in the blackening factor $f(r)$, allowing for an extremal configuration. Solution I reproduces a previously reported AdS black hole when one of the integration constants in $f(r)$ vanishes. For our black hole configurations, the scalar curvature is constant and negative, corresponding to the $AdS_2$ spacetime. In order to elucidate their black hole nature, we explore the causal structure of these solutions with the aid of suitable Kruskal-like coordinates and Penrose diagrams. By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method, we construct a boundary counter-term that renders a renormalized action with a vanishing variation. We use this finite action for the partition function in the semi-classical approximation. We establish a consistent Thermodynamics, verified by the first law, for our black hole solutions, including the extremal case. Finally, we perform a holographic analysis of the effective theory at the boundary of the black hole solution I. This theory is characterized by a Schwarzian action supplemented by a black hole mass term determined by the two integration constants in $f(r)$. We also examine the holographic implications of the boundary counter-term.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced decoherence of a scalar field: investigating the one-particle sector and its interplay with renormalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-particle sector for the field-theoretical model of gravitationally induced decoherence for a scalar field in [1] with a special focus on the renormalisation of the one-particle master equation. In contrast to existing models in the literature, where the renormalisation is usually performed after the Markov and rotating wave approximation and often only for certain limits such as the non- or ultra-relativistic limit, here we apply the renormalisation directly after the one-particle projection. With this strategy, we show that UV-divergent contributions in the one-particle master equation can be identified with the vacuum contributions in the self-energy of the scalar field in the effective quantum field theory and depending on the chosen one-particle projection method, its vacuum bubbles, while the additional thermal contributions in the self-energy are all UV-finite. To obtain the renormalised one-particle master equation, we use an on-shell renormalisation procedure of the underlying effective QFT. We then apply the Markov and rotating wave approximation, specifying a condition under which the Markov approximation can be applied in the case of the ultra-relativistic limit. We compare our results with those available in the literature. This includes an analysis of two different kinds of one-particle projections, a comparison of the application and effects of renormalisation of quantum mechanical and field theoretical models, the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of the renormalised one-particle master equations, and a comparison with a quantum mechanical toy model for gravitationally induced decoherence in the context of neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which are understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge-invariant momentum (gauge fields), and position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) &gt; 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) &lt; 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article arXiv:2405.10937v2, we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. arXiv:1911.12066. We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present orthogonality relations for quasinormal modes of a wide class of asymptotically AdS black holes. The definition is obtained from a standard product, modified by a CPT operator and placed on a complex radial contour which avoids branch points of the modes. They are inspired by existing constructions for de Sitter and Kerr spacetimes. The CPT operator is needed to map right eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian into left eigenfunctions. The radial contour connects two copies of the dual QFT on a thermal Schwinger-Keldysh contour, making contact with real-time holography and the double cone wormhole.</description>

      <title>Representations of the fractional d'Alembertian and initial conditions in fractional dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct representations of complex powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ in Lorentzian signature and pinpoint one which is self-adjoint and suitable for classical and quantum fractional field theory. This self-adjoint fractional d'Alembertian is associated with complex-conjugate poles, which are removed from the physical spectrum via the Anselmi--Piva prescription. As an example of empty spectrum, we consider a purely fractional propagator and its K\"all\'en--Lehmann representation. Using a cleaned-up version of the diffusion method, we formulate and solve the problem of initial conditions of the classical dynamics with a standard plus a fractional d'Alembertian, showing that the number of initial conditions is two. We generalize this result to a much wider class of nonlocal theories and discuss its applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. This work explores the application of a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm to MBHB signals. Under certain simplifying assumptions, quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results illustrate the potential reduction in computational costs, while also showing that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. These findings reveal both the potential and the limitations of quantum search for MBHB signals, pointing to the importance of developing more robust and stable search strategies alongside realistic modeling in future work.</description>

      <title>Revealing Dark Matter's Role in Neutron Stars Anisotropy: A Bayesian Approach Using Multi-messenger Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi &lt; 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a time crystal based on a quantum black-hole laser, where the genuinely spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time observables are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic analogue of the Andreev-Hawking effect, exhibiting anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions. Remarkably, the time-crystal formation is understood in terms of two time operators: one associated to the initial black-hole laser and another associated to the final spontaneous Floquet state.</description>

Abstract: In this work we discuss the issue of localization of $N=2$ spinning particles. More specifically, we show that we can not confine the spinning particle within the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We argue that this result directly affects studies related to localization of $p$-form fields. We show that, due to the non confinement of the superparticle, we can not localize $p$-forms on the membrane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of generic 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) holographic theories with exponential couplings. We find and classify exact, analytic, anisotropic solutions, both zero-temperature vacua and finite-temperature black brane backgrounds, with anisotropy sourced by scalar axions, magnetic fields, and charge densities, that can be interpreted as IR fixed points of renormalisation-group flows from UV-conformal fixed points. The resulting backgrounds feature a hyperscaling violation exponent and up to three independent Lifshitz-like exponents, generated by an equal number of independent coupling constants in the EMDA action. We derive the holographic stress-energy tensor and the corresponding equation of state, and discuss the behavior of the anisotropic speed of sound and butterfly velocity. We show that these theories can be consistently constrained by imposing several natural requirements, including energy conditions, thermodynamic stability, and causality. Additionally, we analyse hard probes in this class of theories, including Brownian motion, momentum broadening and jet quenching, and we demonstrate that a fully analytic treatment is possible, making their dependence on the underlying anisotropy explicit. We highlight the relevance of these models as benchmarks for strongly coupled anisotropic matter in nature, from the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions to dense QCD phases in neutron-star mergers and the cores of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Large-scale peculiar velocities in the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar motions in the universe, commonly referred to as ``bulk flows''. These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).</description>

      <title>Integrability in Three-Dimensional Gravity: Eigenfunction-Forced KdV Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a direct connection between three-dimensional gravity with chiral boundary conditions and a class of forced integrable systems. Starting from the Chern-Simons formulation, we derive consistent boundary conditions on a non-compact spatial slice, leading to boundary dynamics described by the potential modified KdV hierarchy. The dynamics reduce to a forced KdV equation, where the forcing term is determined self-consistently by the eigenfunctions of the associated Schr\"{o}dinger operator. Using the inverse scattering transform, the reflectionless sector is solved via the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko method, while the radiative sector exhibits universal dispersive decay. This framework unifies AdS$_3$ boundary dynamics with integrable hierarchies and elucidates the roles of solitons and radiation in the dual conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization.
  A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process.
  The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set.
  These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.</description>

      <title>The Infra-Red Road to Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review work in areas ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity, with the following interconnected questions in mind: (i) what is the nature of the vacuum in condensed matter systems, in quantum field theory, and in classical and quantum gravity; (ii) how do analogies between these systems work, how well do they work, and how useful are they; (iii) what modifications can we make to quantum mechanics to deal with quantum gravity, and (iv) how and why low-energy theories of quantum gravity are, in our view, the right way to make progress in this field. We use many different examples to illustrate our arguments.</description>
