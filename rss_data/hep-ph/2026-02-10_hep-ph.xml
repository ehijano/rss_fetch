      <title>Assessing the Impact of Fitting Methodology at aN$^3$LO with FPPDF: an Open Source Tool for Extracting Parton Distribution Functions in the Hessian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new public code, FPPDF, to perform global fits of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The fitting methodology follows that implemented by the MSHT collaboration, namely applying a fixed polynomial parameterisation of the PDFs and Hessian approach to error propagation, while for data and theory settings the libraries used by the NNPDF collaboration are taken. This therefore complements the already publicly available NNPDF fitting code to enable fits with both neural network and fixed polynomial PDF parameterisations to be performed by the community, with otherwise identical theoretical and experimental inputs. As a first application, we use the new code to compare the PDFs found from fits at both NNLO and aN$^3$LO perturbative orders, but applying these two fitting approaches. We assess the impact of the two different methodologies on the PDFs and their uncertainties, providing results that complement previous comparisons between published PDF sets at NNLO and aN$^3$LO. We in particular find that the relative impact of going to the higher perturbative order and/or including missing higher order uncertainties is rather insensitive to which of these PDF parameterisation methodologies are used.</description>

      <title>Radiative Seesaw Model with Baryon Number Violation and Upper Limit on Neutron-anti-Neutron Transition Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal scotogenic model where small neutrino masses arise via radiative seesaw, is known to provide a unified framework for neutrino mass and origin of matter via leptogenesis. However if the inflation reheat temperature of the universe is below the sphaleron reheating temperature, then leptogenesis fails and one way to understand the origin of matter would be to add an effective interaction involving the right handed neutrino (RHN) $N$ of the form $\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}N u_Rd_Rd_R$. This model can lead to observable neutron-anti-neutron ($n-\bar{n}$) oscillation. We show that if RHNs are produced non-thermally, we can get a cosmological upper limit on the transition time $\tau_{n-\bar{n}}$, which is within the reach of the planned ESS HIBEAM/NNBAR experiment. The proton stability is guaranteed by the scotogenic $Z_2$ invariance, which prevents the appearance of the Dirac mass term for the neutrino</description>

      <title>Can Dirac neutrinos destabilize $\mathcal{Z}_2$ domain wall network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle physics model building, a discrete $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is often spontaneously broken for phenomenological reasons. When this breaking occurs dynamically in the early Universe, stable domain wall networks are formed, which can eventually dominate the cosmic energy density. To avoid this problem, explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$-breaking terms in the scalar potential are usually introduced in an ad hoc manner. In this Letter, we show that if the same $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is also responsible for generating light Dirac neutrino masses, such explicit breaking terms can instead arise radiatively from the particles involved in the Dirac mass generation. We find that the resulting bias term scales inversely with the cube of the Dirac neutrino mass, leading to a gravitational wave spectrum proportional to the sixth power of the Dirac neutrino mass. This establishes a nontrivial connection between the Dirac seesaw scale, the domain wall annihilation epoch, and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal. We further demonstrate that a wide range of Dirac seesaw scales can be probed by upcoming gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments, while part of the parameter space simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Fermionic Dark Matter Absorption from Radiochemical Solar-Neutrino Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinterpret classic radiochemical solar-neutrino measurements as ``rate meters'' for additional, non-negative capture-like contributions induced by fermionic dark matter absorption. Using the chlorine and gallium production-rate data, we build a Bayesian likelihood that accounts for the dominant uncertainties in the solar-neutrino capture-rate prediction (solar fluxes, oscillation parameters, and capture cross sections). Solar-model metallicity systematics are made explicit by presenting results for both the B16--GS98 and B16--AGSS09met solar-model realizations. From the 1D marginalized posteriors of the joint $(R_{\chi,\mathrm{Cl}},R_{\chi,\mathrm{Ga}})$ analysis, we obtain 90\% upper limits on additional capture-like rate contributions, dominated by chlorine: $R_{\chi,\mathrm{Cl},90}\simeq 0.388~\mathrm{SNU}$ (B16--GS98) and $0.588~\mathrm{SNU}$ (B16--AGSS09met). In the charged-current V--A benchmark, we map these constraints onto upper bounds on $y\equiv m_\chi^2/(4\pi\Lambda^4)$ for $m_\chi$ above the ${}^{71}$Ga and ${}^{37}$Cl capture thresholds, using a pep-normalized operator mapping anchored to solar-neutrino capture inputs, where $m_\chi$ is the dark matter mass and $\Lambda$ is the effective scale suppressing the charged-current operator. At $m_\chi\simeq 1~\mathrm{MeV}$, we find $y_{90}\simeq 4.88\times 10^{-49}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ (B16--GS98) and $7.08\times 10^{-49}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ (B16--AGSS09met). These radiochemical bounds are complementary to xenon-based absorption searches and collider interpretations by probing distinct nuclear targets with minimal reliance on spectral reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SIMPonium bound states of complex scalar dark matter: Relic density and astrophysical signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a strongly interacting complex scalar dark matter candidate $(\chi)$, subject to an attractive potential mediated by a vector boson $A^\mu$. Such interactions allow $\chi$ to form bound states: SIMPonium. In this work, we systematically investigate the bound state dynamics of our dark sector, including the formation and decay of SIMPonium and it's influence on the thermal history. Our analysis shows in absence of any bound state formation $\chi$ freezes out at $x\approx 16$ and the presence of SIMPonium in the thermal bath slightly modifies the freeze out behaviour of the free $\chi$ particles, which freezes out at $x \approx 20$. While the bound state itself remains in chemical equilibrium for a longer duration and freezes out at a significantly later time, $x \approx 250$. We compute the indirect energy spectra arising from free dark matter annihilation and SIMPonium decay, where the resulting Standard Model particles subsequently produce both final state radiation and radiative decay spectra. We find that the total differential photon flux from dark matter with mass $m_\chi = 150\,\mathrm{MeV}$ lies in the range $E_\gamma^2 \frac{d\phi}{d\Omega\, dE_\gamma} \in [10^{-27},\,10^{-17}] \,\mathrm{MeV\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ , for photon energies in the interval $E_\gamma \in [10^{-3},\,10^{2}] \,\mathrm{MeV}$. The predicted signal is therefore exceedingly feeble and remains well below the sensitivity of current experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Far-from-Equilibrium Attractors and Universality in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions within Relativistic Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PhD Thesis is devoted to the study of the emergence of attractors, universality and collectivity in ultra-relativistic collisions by means of relativistic kinetic theory. After an introduction about Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the importance of heavy-ion collisions to investigate both, we give an overview about the two main models able to describe the hot QCD matter collective behaviour, namely kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. Afterwards, the Relativistic Boltzmann Transport (RBT) model, which has been employed to obtain most part of the results of this thesis, is carefully described, from the numerical and physical perspectives. The study of attractors and universality proceeds then by starting from a simple one-dimensional massless model, moving to increasingly more complex scenarios, involving the full 3+1D setup, non-conformal systems and realistic event-by-event fluctuations. Particular attention is paid to the physical scales which govern the system collectivity and their interplay. We show that a very good description of collective behaviour can be carried out by means of a few variables which characterise the systems under study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an exotic type of single spin asymmetry in unpolarized electron-proton scattering, in which the outgoing electron momentum exhibits a left-right asymmetry relative to the transverse spin of the leading baryon $B$ in the target fragmentation region. We lay out two theoretical frameworks for describing this effect: The twist-three fracture function at high-$Q^2$ and the spin-dependent odderon in the high energy limit.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter as Screened Ordinary Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at our since long studied model for dark matter as being pearls of a speculated new vacuum containing highly compressed ordinary matter, with so much ordinary in it that the content of ordinary matter in the dark matter pearls dominate. Most dark matter models have the dark matter consisting mainly of new-physics-matter such as WIMPs being supersymmetric partners of possibly known particles or, as in Maxim Khlopovs model, a doubly negatively charged new-physics-particle with a helium nucleus attached. But usually the new-physics matter makes up weight-wise the major content. It is only in our model that the ordinary matter content in the dark matter dominates. We here expose some weak phenomenological evidence that, in truth, dark matter should be of the type with a dominant component of ordinary matter (weight-wise), thus favoring as the typical example our previously so much studied vacuum type 2 model. The main such evidence is that we manage a fit to data in which the 3.5 keV X-rays, presumed to result from dark matter, come both from collisions of dark matter with dark matter and from dark matter with ordinary matter! Both mechanisms are of so similar an order of magnitude that they are both seen, indicating that their similarity is due to a significant similarity between dark with ordinary matter. The fact that the amounts of ordinary and dark matter only deviate by a factor 6 points in the same direction. Using the information obtained from this fitting, we develop our speculation that the main content weight-wise of dark matter is ordinary matter to the very DAMA experiment. Actually we found three spots on the sky in which we fit the observed production of 3.5 keV X-rays with ordinary plus dark scattering.</description>

      <title>Coulomb corrections in rare decays of neutral $B$ mesons with $\ell^+\ell^-$-pair in final state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of Coulomb corrections for leptonic ($B^0_{d,s}\to \ell^+\ell^-$), semileptonic ($B^0_{d,s}\to h^0\,\ell^+\ell^-$, $B^0_{d,s}\to V^0\ell^+\ell^-$) and radiative leptonic ($B^0_{d,s}\to \gamma \ell^+\ell^-$) decays of neutral $B$-mesons. The relativization of the Coulomb factor was performed by comparing the Gamow-Sommerfeld-Sakharov factor, the exact relativistic approach of Crater-Alstine-Sazdjian applied by us to scalar systems, and well-known one-loop QED calculations. Coulomb corrections are calculated for differential, angular, and double-differential distributions, as well as for partial decay widths.
  For the $B_s^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$ channel, Coulomb corrections improve the prediction of the partial width to $\delta = |\mathcal{B}^{(exp)} - \mathcal{B}^{(theory)}|/\mathcal{B}^{(exp)} = 2\%$. This improvement brings the prediction closer to the LHCb/CMS experimental results within the current experimental (11\%) and theoretical (5\% lattice QCD) errors. In the decays $B^0\to K^0\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0 \to K^{0*}\mu^+\mu^-$, Coulomb effects also reduce the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data (to less than $\delta = 1\%$ and from $\delta = 11\%$ to $\delta = 4\%$ respectively). Finally, for the decays involving $\tau$-leptons, the Coulomb correction $\mathcal{K} = \mathcal{B}^{(Coulomb)}/ \mathcal{B}^{(free)}$ reaches 4\%. While currently smaller than the dominant form-factor uncertainties and experimental errors, the Coulomb correction represents a non-negligible systematic effect. It should be accounted for in the high-precision era of $B$-physics, where such effects may become significant for the interpretation of potential New Physics signals.</description>

      <title>The structure of the $X(3915)$ meson and its production in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of the $X(3915)$ meson in a quark model and explore how its production in heavy ion collisions depends on its internal structure. We first analyze the $X(3915)$ as a $c\bar{c}s\bar{s}$ state and solve the Hamiltonian with color-spin interactions within the quark model. We find that the ground state of the $c\bar{c}s\bar{s}$ with total spin 0 obtained from the quark model analysis favors a separated $D_s \bar{D}_s$ state. To probe its structure further, we study its production in relativistic heavy ion collisions for various proposed configurations. We calculate the transverse momentum distributions and yields for the $X(3915)$ assuming its structure to be either a charmonium, a tetraquark, or a hadronic molecular state. We argue that by measuring the transverse momentum distributions and yields of the $X(3915)$ produced in heavy ion collisions, one can identify the structure of the $X(3915)$.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Gaps in Solar and Reactor Neutrino Oscillation Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum estimation theory provides a fundamental framework for analyzing how precisely physical parameters can be estimated from measurements. Neutrino oscillations are characterized by a set of parameters inferred from experiments conducted in different production and detection environments. The two solar oscillation parameters, $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$, can be estimated using both solar neutrino experiments and reactor neutrino experiments. In reactor experiments, neutrinos are detected after coherent vacuum evolution, while solar neutrinos arrive at the detector as incoherent mixtures. In this work, we use Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to quantify and compare the information content accessible in these two experimental setups. We find that for reactor neutrinos, flavor measurements saturate the QFI bound for both parameters over specific energy ranges, demonstrating their optimality and explaining the high precision achieved by these experiments. In contrast, for solar neutrinos the phase-based contribution to the QFI, originating from the quantum coherence, is absent, rendering the estimation of $\Delta m_{21}^2$ purely population-based and effectively classical, while the QFI for $\theta_{12}$ is dominated by basis rotation at high energies and is nearly saturated by flavor measurements. Consequently, solar neutrino experiments are intrinsically more sensitive to $\theta_{12}$ than to $\Delta m_{21}^2$. This analysis highlights a fundamental distinction between the two estimation problems and accounts for their differing achievable precisions.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Lorentz Invariance Violation and Earth's Matter Potential in High-Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in the neutrino sector have traditionally focused on non-standard neutrino oscillations induced by LIV in vacuum. In this work, however, we study anisotropic LIV in matter. First, we review vacuum LIV phenomenology, explaining the energy and direction dependence of sidereal modulations for anisotropic coefficients in the Standard Model Extension. We then demonstrate that for high-energy neutrinos, the interplay between anisotropic LIV operators and the Earth's matter potential produces, distinct, observable signatures absent in the vacuum case. We identify a crossover regime where the energy-dependent LIV Hamiltonian becomes comparable to the matter potential, leading to strong interference effects. By analyzing the propagation of neutrinos through a realistic Earth model, we establish three key phenomenological consequences: (1) direction-dependent resonant enhancements of oscillation probabilities, (2) a macroscopic breakdown of neutrino-antineutrino symmetry for CPT-even operators, and (3) a significant increase of the $\nu_\tau$ flux due to LIV-driven injection of high-energy neutrinos into the $\tau$ regeneration cycle. These results highlight that accounting for the interplay between LIV and matter is essential for future LIV searches at large-scale neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of a massless quark-gluon gas in chemical equilibrium including all $2\leftrightarrow 2$ cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical expressions of the shear viscosity of both one and two particle species with Boltzmann statistics and $2 \rightarrow 2$ elastic scatterings are known from the Chapman-Enskog method and have been shown to be quite accurate. The expression for a multi-species hadronic gas under $2 \rightarrow 2$ elastic scatterings is also known. Here we use the Chapman-Enskog method to derive the shear viscosity of a massless quark-gluon gas of $N_f$ quark flavors in chemical equilibrium subjected to all $2 \rightarrow 2$ parton scatterings including for the first time inelastic scatterings. We then verify the relation in a general single-species limit, where the shear viscosity of the quark-gluon gas should reduce to the result for a single particle species. In addition, we show the explicit analytical result in terms of the seven independent cross sections for the special case of isotropic and energy-independent cross sections. The analytical relations derived here can be useful for determining the shear viscosity of parton transport models with any $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering cross sections. They can also be coupled with finite temperature QCD cross sections to help study the shear viscosity of the quark gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate the production of a dark fermionic particle $\chi$ in the neutrino scattering experiments. In the framework of effective field theory, such process can be induced by the effective four-fermion interactions involving neutrinos, the dark particle $\chi$ and standard model particles. In particular, we examine the constraints on the effective couplings from the neutrinos scattering off nuclei in the COHERENT and CONUS+ experiments as well as the prospects at the DUNE near detector from neutrino-electron scattering. It turns out the current COHERENT and CONUS+ constraints on the cutoff scales are less stringent than those from the existing Large Hadron Collider data. However, the DUNE near detector could probe the cutoff scales beyond the existing CHARM II and LEP limits up to roughly 1 TeV, for the dark particle mass up to roughly 50 MeV.</description>

      <title>FIMPs in a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the FIMPs scenario in a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majorana fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. The model admits six free parameters in the decoupling limit: three masses and three dimensionless parameters. Depending on the mass hierarchies between dark matter particles with half of the new Higgs mass, the DM relic density will be determined by different channels, where $\chi$ and $S$ production can be generated individually. We numerically study the relic density as a function of the model's free parameters and determine the regions consistent with the dark matter constraint for four possible cases. Our results show that this scenario is viable over a wide range of couplings and dark matter masses, where the coupling $\lambda_{ds}$ can be as tiny as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ level. We stress that even for such tiny couplings, the new Higgs can still play a dominant role in determining dark matter production.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark collisional energy loss in a nonextensive quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we derive the longitudinal and transverse gluon self-energies and the corresponding dielectric functions for a nonextensive QGP, based on nonextensive statistical mechanics and a kinetic theory framework. The nonextensive parameter $q$ enters these quantities primarily through the modification of the Debye mass. Utilizing the derived dielectric functions, we then calculate the collisional energy loss for a heavy quark using two established formalisms: the plasma physics-based Thoma-Gyulassy formula and the thermal field theory-originated Kirzhnits-Thoma formula. Our results show that for both formalisms, the collisional energy loss increases with the nonextensive parameter $q$ with this enhancement being more significant at higher incident quark momenta and suppressed for a heavier quark mass. The energy loss predicted from the Kirzhnits-Thoma formula is substantially larger than that from the Thoma-Gyulassy formula, and the nonextensive effect on the energy loss is more pronounced in the former. Furthermore, the mass suppression of the nonextensive effect on the energy loss is weaker in the Kirzhnits-Thoma approach. These calculations demonstrate that nonextensive statistics can significantly alter the energy loss in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decays of hyperons in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decays of spin-1/2 hyperons are investigated in a covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory framework, extended by a $\Delta L=2$ operator proportional to the Majorana neutrino mass, where $L$ denotes the lepton number. Within the light Majorana neutrino exchange mechanism, the decay amplitudes are found to emerge at the one-loop level, representing the long-range contribution. The extended-on-mass-shell scheme is employed to renormalize the one-loop amplitudes and restore consistent chiral power counting. Consequently, the differential decay rates for all accessible hyperon $0\nu\beta\beta$ channels are predicted and the corresponding branching ratios are more than 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental upper bounds. Interestingly, it is found that the leading contribution to hyperon $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is actually from short-range counterterm operators, as required by the renormalization argument. Neutrinoless transition form factors are proposed to determine this leading contribution through future lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Charge asymmetry in $e^{+}e^{-}\to B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ processes in the vicinity of $\Upsilon(4S)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of isotopic invariance violation in the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\to B\bar{B}$, $e^{+}e^{-}\to B^{*}\bar{B}$, and $e^{+}e^{-}\to B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ are considered in the energy range between the thresholds of $B^{+}B^{-}$ and $B_{s}^{0}\bar{B}_{s}^{0}$ production. The analysis is based on taking into account the final-state interaction in a six-channel problem. Our approach allowed us to obtain good agreement with recent Belle-II results for the ratio of the $B^{0}\bar{B}^{0}$ and $B^{+}B^{-}$ production cross sections in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation in the vicinity of $\Upsilon(4S)$. It is shown that at higher energies the ratios of the cross sections for pairs of neutral and charged $B^{(*)}$ mesons can differ significantly from unity. A detailed measurement of this effect will provide evidence that the nontrivial energy dependence of the $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ production cross sections is a consequence of interference of the particle production amplitudes in the multichannel problem.</description>

      <title>A light DM model for large $B \to K + \mbox{invisible}$ and $K \to \pi + \mbox{invisible}$ decays and its implications for $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing and neutron EDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a light dark matter model with sizable invisible rare meson decays to accommodate possible larger than standard model (SM) predictions for both $B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ by Belle II and $K^+\to\pi^+\nu \bar \nu$ by NA62. Since the emitted neutrinos are unobserved, the excesses may be due to light dark matter pairs in the final states. We show that it is possible to realize this by a UV-complete model based on a two Higgs doublet model. The neutral spin-zero Higgs bosons (scalar or pseudoscalar) mediating dark matter interaction, can also produce some effects at low energies which modify the SM predictions significantly. In particular we find large testable consequences for $B_s - \bar B_s$ mixing due to splitting of scalar and pseudoscalar masses, and also neutron EDM. We find that there is a cancellation due to exchange of neutral spin-zero particle for neutron EDM in general, but QCD running will lift this cancellation.This is generally true for any neutral Higgs contributions. However, we find that such a cancellation does not happen for charged scalar contribution. The allowed CP violating phase in the Yukawa sector can produce a neutron EDM experimental bound.</description>

      <title>Global observables and identified-hadron production in pp, O-O and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC Run 3 energies with EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of collectivity in small and large collision systems challenges our understanding of thermalization and particle production. EPOS4 models this via a dynamical core--corona separation, where high-density regions form a collectively expanding core while low-density regions hadronize via string fragmentation. Its microcanonical core hadronization improves the description of transverse momentum and multiplicity-dependent observables. We present EPOS4 predictions for pp, O-O and Pb-Pb collisions, with and without UrQMD, showing non-universal $\langle p_T\rangle$ scaling, significant hadronic-phase effects, and system-size-dependent $R_{AA}$ suppression. Charged-particle and transverse-energy densities show participant scaling; the transverse energy per charged particle is systematically larger in O--O than in Pb--Pb at comparable participant fraction, indicating a harder effective production in the lighter system. Identified-hadron spectra harden with event multiplicity with mass ordering and increasing core fractions. The mean transverse momentum exhibits a strong system dependence, with the steepest multiplicity evolution in pp, demonstrating that $\langle p_T\rangle$ does not follow universal multiplicity scaling. The $p/\pi$ ratio shows an enhanced intermediate-$p_T$ region; the suppression of the integrated $p/\pi$ at the highest Pb--Pb multiplicities is reproduced only with UrQMD, highlighting hadronic-phase effects. The nuclear modification factor shows sizeable suppression in Pb--Pb and substantial suppression in central O--O collisions. Blast-wave fits exhibit the anti-correlation between $T_{\rm kin}$ and $\langle\beta_T\rangle$, with UrQMD shifting the parameters towards lower $T_{\rm kin}$ and higher $\langle\beta_T\rangle$. These results provide a timely baseline for Run~3 measurements and for constraining the onset of medium-like effects across system size.</description>

      <title>Can Mirror Symmetry Challenge Local Realism? Probing Photon Entanglement from Positronium via Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates photon entanglement generated from para-positronium decay by analyzing azimuthal correlations after the double Compton scattering with stationary electrons. We introduce a normalized correlation observable $\mathcal{O}_1 = \cos(2\phi_1 - 2\phi_2)/C_1$ to witness entanglement. In the absence of decoherence, $\langle\mathcal{O}_1\rangle = -1$, corresponding to a maximally entangled Bell state. With decoherence parameterized by $\rho$, the expectation becomes $-(1-\rho)$, allowing direct experimental quantification of coherence loss. A prior symmetry analysis of the Compton scattering process within the quantum field theory (QFT) is provided, which establishes the mirror-symmetric nature of the single-photon angular distribution. We further examine a local hidden-variable theory (LHVT) under the angular-momentum conservation. Imposing the mirror symmetry with respect to the plane defined by the photon spin and momentum leads to a non-negative LHVT prediction for $\langle \sin^2\theta_1 \sin^2\theta_2 \cos(2\phi_1-2\phi_2)\rangle$, contradicting the negative QFT prediction value for any $\rho &lt; 1$. Thus, mirror symmetry serves as a novel criterion to exclude LHVT descriptions of the entangled state, whereas without preserving this symmetry, LHVTs can reproduce the correlations.</description>

      <title>On soft contributions to the $B^-\to \gamma^*$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photoleptonic decay $B^-\to \gamma \ell^-\bar{\nu}$ is the simplest low-energy process that probes the substructure of the $B$ meson, making it an excellent candidate to determine the parameters of $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from experimental data. More recently, the decay $B^-\to \gamma^*(\to \ell'^-\ell'^+)\ell^-\bar\nu$ has received attention as an alternative probe of these parameters. Both decays are described through a common set of hadronic form factors, which if computed within the framework of QCD factorization give rise to the sensitivity to the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes. Nevertheless, in this case the form factors still receive so-called soft contributions that can only be estimated but not rigorously computed. In this work, we provide results for the QCD factorization expressions for the form factors, including terms at next-to-leading power in the $b$ quark mass and in the photon energy. We further use these results to estimate the soft contributions within a light-cone sum rule setup. Finally, using numerical results obtained from a benchmark model of the light-cone distribution amplitudes, we show that the soft contributions are under significantly better theoretical control at a mildly spacelike photon virtuality.</description>

      <title>Primordial features as probes of baryogenesis from supersymmetric flat directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Affleck-Dine mechanism is a leading baryogenesis scenario in which scalar condensates form coherently during inflation along supersymmetric flat directions that are lifted by supersymmetry-breaking effects. We update the viable parameter space for baryogenesis using recent Cosmic Microwave Background constraints on baryon-density isocurvature perturbations, taking the quantum fluctuations of the scalar condensate generated during inflation as initial conditions. We then show that primordial features arising from the inflaton sector can serve as a unique probe of baryogenesis models, whose mechanisms are otherwise difficult to access directly due to their high energy scales. These primordial features leave correlated imprints, such as sharp feature signals and clock signals, on both the curvature and baryon-density isocurvature perturbations, providing direct evidence for the existence of both light and heavy modes involved in the Affleck-Dine mechanism.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation with the Gaussian expansion method for doubly heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is widely used to investigate the properties of hydrogen-like systems and doubly heavy hadrons. However, the extent to which this approximation reliably captures the true features of such systems remains an open question. In this work, we adopt the results obtained with the Gaussian expansion method as a benchmark to assess the validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in hadronic systems. We also investigate the dependence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation results on the choice of trial wave functions. A comprehensive study of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is carried out by performing calculations using Slater-type functions and Gaussian-type functions as trial wave functions, and by comparing the resulting predictions with those obtained from the Gaussian expansion method. We find that the calculations performed within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation are close to those obtained with the Gaussian expansion method when the heavy-quark mass is relatively small. However, as the heavy-quark mass increases, calculations employing Slater-type functions yield larger values than those from the Gaussian expansion method, whereas those using Gaussian-type functions lead to smaller ones. The use of Slater-type functions generally leads to an enhanced binding energy. The underestimation observed in Born-Oppenheimer approximation calculations with Gaussian-type functions primarily stems from the neglect of non-adiabatic corrections. This comparative study provides deeper insight into the structure of doubly heavy hadrons and clarifies the applicability and limitations of the Born-Oppenheimer treatment in these systems.</description>

Abstract: It is demonstrated that, within the eikonal approach, the Coulomb corrections to the elastic electromagnetic non-flip and spin-flip proton--nucleus amplitudes are identical when the two amplitudes share the same exponential form factors. This result allows Coulomb corrections to be computed numerically, and with high precision, for both electromagnetic and hadronic elastic $p^{\uparrow}A$ amplitudes in the massless-photon limit, including the effects of soft magnetic photon exchange. The method relies on analytical expressions and numerical integrations over a finite impact-parameter range with nonsingular integrands, providing a practical and systematically controlled framework for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Testing the nuclear TMD gluon densities with heavy flavor production in proton-lead collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a simple model for nuclear modification of ordinary parton densities in a proton to evaluate the Transverse Momentum Dependent gluon and quark distributions in nuclei (nTMDs) within the popular Kimber-Martin-Ryskin/Watt-Martin-Ryskin approach. The model is based on a global analysis of available deep inelastic scattering data for different nuclear targets within the rescaling model, incorporating Fermi motion effects. The derived nTMDs are tested with latest CMS data on inclusive $b$-jet and $B^+$ meson production in proton-lead collisions collected at $\sqrt s = 5.02$ and $8.16$~TeV using the High Energy Factorization framework. We predict the corresponding nuclear medium modification factors to be about of $0.8 - 1.2$ in the probed kinematical region, which is consistent with other estimations. Specially we highlight a possibility to investigate the nuclear modification of parton densities by applying different cuts on the final states in such processes.</description>

Here, to avoid understandable biases, I show below the results of an experiment: letting an AI compare the data and the two models. All of what follows (but two references, two footnotes and the next sentence) is the result of asking Perplexity.ai to perform this confrontational task.

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom and Vacuum Polarization Determine the Astrophysical End State of Relativistic Gravitational Collapse: Quark--Gluon Plasma Star Instead of Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark--gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\lesssim$ M$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim$\,7\,M$_\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\lesssim R^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim 24$\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \leq$ B$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}} \leq 10^{16}$\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Feed-down Hadrons in a Thermal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the potential impact of strong decays on the magnitude of fluctuations of net quantum numbers and integrals of balance functions based on a thermal hadron gas model. The calculations are based on a comprehensive list of known hadrons with masses up to 2.5 GeV/$c^2$ and include all decays of these hadrons with known branching fractions. The calculations are performed at vanishing baryo-chemical potential for temperatures between 140 and 200 MeV. We show that the decays feed-down substantially impact the single yield of measurable ``stable particles" as well as those of correlated densities of these species. Decays can then potentially have large and non-trivial impacts on measurements of net quantum number cumulants and balance functions. These observations are particularly important in the context of the search for the QCD critical point at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan as well as efforts to determine chemical susceptibilities near the phase transition at RHIC or LHC energies. Results obtained in this work also shed light on the importance of feed-down in measurements of balance functions in elementary p-p and nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical positronium and Dicke superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance is a fascinating phenomenon in which a large number of atoms cooperate to produce a brief and very intense burst of spontaneous emission. This phenomenon has been well studied in the laboratory, but its astrophysical aspects have only recently attracted the attention of a small number of researchers. Since the phenomenon of Dicke superradiance is relatively little known to the wider astrophysical community, we provide a fairly detailed review of its elementary theory in the appendix and speculate on the significance of superradiance for astrophysical hydrogen and positronium, given the abundant formation of the latter near the galactic center.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Table of Calculated Huff Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic calculation of the Huff factor for nuclei with atomic numbers ($ Z $) in the range of $ 6 \leq Z \leq 94 $. The Huff factor quantifies the increase in the partial lifetime of the decay-in-orbit (DIO) of the muonic atom and serves as an essential correction factor for extracting the nuclear muon capture rate from the measured lifetimes of the muonic atom. However, previous calculations typically provided only the atomic number dependence and neglected isotope dependence -- an assumption whose reliability had not been examined, despite its importance for a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear muon capture rate. In this work, we calculate the Huff factor using nuclear charge distributions obtained from a fully self-consistent microscopic nuclear structure model that incorporates pairing and deformation effects. The resulting Huff factors exhibit a monotonic decrease with increasing $ Z $, while the isotope dependence is found to be small. Our results also show good agreement with previous calculations, supporting the reliability of the present framework. The comprehensive set of Huff factors presented here constitutes the first unified values currently available and will serve as a basis for future evaluations of muon nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Radiative decay of heavy-light mesons from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of the radiative decays of charmed mesons using $2+1$-flavor clover fermion gauge ensembles generated by the CLQCD collaboration. One of the ensembles is at the physical pion mass, and one has a fine lattice spacing $a\sim 0.05 ~\text{fm}$. We determine the coupling constants to be $g_{D^{\ast+} D^+ \gamma} = -0.205(35)$ GeV$^{-1}$, $g_{D^{\ast0} D^0 \gamma} = 2.20(27)$ GeV$^{-1}$, and $g_{D_s^{\ast+} D_s^+ \gamma} = -0.125(21)$ GeV$^{-1}$, respectively. Compared with previous studies, our results demonstrate significant improvements in precision. In particular, we carefully estimate the systematic uncertainty arising from matrix element fits, momentum transfer extrapolations, and chiral and continuum limit extrapolations, which are included in the reported total uncertainties. These couplings yield the following predictions of decay widths: $\Gamma_{D^{\ast+} \rightarrow D^+ \gamma} = 0.255(87)$ keV, $\Gamma_{D^{\ast0} \rightarrow D^0 \gamma} = 29.4(7.2)$ keV, and $\Gamma_{D_s^{\ast+}\rightarrow D_s^+ \gamma} = 0.102(34)$ keV. This work establishes first-principles results of the charmed meson radiative transitions and provides inputs for understanding the structure and properties of heavy-light mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the totality of dark matter in the universe might ascribe its origin to one of the key properties of cosmological inflation, that it may be eternal: regions that at the end of the primordial accelerated expansion of the universe never reheated, but keep eternally inflating, manifest themselves as primordial black holes in our observable universe. This mechanism can provide a primordial black hole abundance which is larger than the standard one due to the gravitational collapse of sizeable overdensities in the radiation phase. It also predicts a broad spectrum for the curvature perturbation and a flat stochastic gravitational wave background at a level of $\Omega_\text{GW} h^2 \simeq 10^{-10}$ up to the mHz.</description>

      <title>Holographic information measures for spin-$3/2$ $\Delta$ baryons in AdS/QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-$3/2$ $\Delta$ baryon resonances are investigated within AdS/QCD, using Rarita-Schwinger fields. The differential configurational entropy (DCE) and differential configurational complexity (DCC) associated with their bulk energy densities are computed. It yields Regge-like trajectories relating configurational information measures to the radial excitation number and the experimental mass spectrum of the $\Delta$ baryons. We then extrapolate the spectrum of heavier $\Delta$ baryon resonances beyond currently established states in the PDG, also comparing them with states in PDG omitted from the summary table. Our results support a relevant interplay among holographic QCD dynamics, configurational information entropy, and baryon spectroscopy in strongly coupled QCD.</description>

      <title>Constraints on non-standard neutrino interactions from Borexino extended data-set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) constitute an active research field, as they are closely related to potential new physics associated with dark matter searches and exotic interactions arising from fundamental symmetry violations. The Borexino's unprecedented sensitivity to solar neutrinos, derived from its low background and precision spectral measurements, enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation paradigm. This work presents an update on the analysis of flavor-diagonal NSI using the full Borexino Phase-III data set, extending the study previously reported in Constraints on flavor-diagonal non-standard neutrino interactions from Borexino Phase-II (JHEP 2020, 38). The updated analysis incorporates the extended temporal and statistical coverage of Phase-III. The results indicate improved sensitivity to the diagonal NSI parameters, with constraints exceeding those obtained in Phase-II. Furthermore, a more general analysis that includes all possible off-diagonal NSI terms is presented for the first time, providing a comprehensive exploration of the NSI parameter space associated with the flavors of the incoming and outgoing neutrinos. This work once again underlines Borexino's critical role in probing new physics scenarios and reinforces its legacy in neutrino research. Detailed comparisons with Phase-II results are discussed, along with implications for theoretical models of NSI.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron Self-Compton Process for Constraining sub-GeV Dark Matter in Omega Centauri via SKA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for the particle identity of dark matter (DM) continues to be a primary objective in modern physics. In this field, the sub-GeV mass range of DM detection remains a crucial yet challenging window. We investigate synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from electrons and positrons produced by MeV-scale DM annihilation as a novel indirect detection channel. Focusing on the globular cluster Omega Centauri and the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array, we derive constraints on the annihilation cross section reaching $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim 10^{-30}\,\rm{cm}^{3}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ in the tens-of-MeV range. Furthermore, constraints could even reach below $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim 10^{-32}\,\rm{cm}^{3}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ for extreme parameter choices. Remarkably, even under deliberately conservative astrophysical assumptions, this channel outperforms existing indirect limits, establishing SSC emission as a robust probe of sub-GeV DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first complete high-precision QCD corrections to the inclusive decay width $\mathrm{\Gamma}_t$, the $W$-helicity fractions $f_{\mathrm{L,R,0}}$ and semi-inclusive distributions for the top-quark decay process $t \rightarrow b + W^+ + X_{\mathrm{\tiny QCD}}$ at NNNLO in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. In particular, the pure NNNLO QCD correction decreases the $\mathrm{\Gamma}_t$ by about $0.8\%$ of the previous NNLO result at the top-quark pole mass scale, exceeding the error estimated by the usual scale-variation prescription. After taking into account all sources of errors, we get $\mathrm{\Gamma}_t = 1.3148^{+0.003}_{-0.005} + 0.027\,(m_t - 172.69)\,\text{GeV} $, the error of which meets the request by future colliders. On the other hand, the NNNLO QCD effects on $f_{\mathrm{L,R,0}}$ are found to be much smaller, at the level of one per-mille for the dominating $f_{0}$, predestining them to act as precision observables for the top-quark decay process.</description>

      <title>An EFT origin of Secluded Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study aims to unveil a scenario with a non-minimal secluded dark sector (DS) in an effective field theory (EFT) framework. To explore this, we have examined a suitable extension of the type-X Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) as a potential origin for the secluded DS. The DS comprises a dark matter (DM) candidate and a mediator particle `$a$' and possesses some non-minimal characteristics. It becomes non-thermally populated through diverse dim-6 four-Fermi operators, effectively generated by integrating out the heavier Higgs particles. The analysis further focuses on the consequences of the collision processes $\textit{DM}+ a \leftrightarrow a + a$ and $\textit{DM}+ \textit{DM} \leftrightarrow a + a$ occurring within the DS. We have investigated the significance of employing an EFT approach in tracking the temperature evolution of the DS. Within the present framework, the observed relic abundance of the DM can be realized through both dark freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms. Further, we have delineated the permissible ranges of the relevant parameters, viz., the DM mass ($m_\chi \gtrsim 20 \, \text{GeV}$), the portal coupling ($C_\tau \lesssim 10^{-14}\, \text{GeV}^{-2}$), and the DS coupling ($\lambda \lesssim 10^{-6} \,\text{GeV}^{-2}$) by taking into account the perturbativity of the involved couplings while reproducing the observed DM relic and complying with the bounds from a successful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and $\gamma$-ray searches.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-photon and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in both systems share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase and providing a novel perspective on axion experiments. We conceptually propose a new photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase offers a unique method for probing the global structure of the Standard Model gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

By measuring the quantum phase difference, this device can detect charged particles with extremely low kinetic energy, providing a new method for detecting slow-moving particles.

      <description>arXiv:2502.20274v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a complete joint angular distribution analysis for the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi\to B(\to B_1\pi)\bar{B}(\to \bar{B}_1\pi)$ with polarized beams, where $B$ and $B_{1}$ are hyperons. We consider both transverse and longitudinal beam polarization and analyze $CP$ violation in the production and decay of hyperons. We present the complete Fisher information matrix for the sensitivities of the weak decay parameters $\alpha_{-},~\alpha_{+},~\phi_{\Xi}$ and $\bar{\phi}_{\Xi}$, the $P$-violating term $F_{A}$, and the EDM $d_{B}$ (derived from the $CP$-violating term $H_{T}$), under the BESIII and STCF statistics. We find that polarization enhances the sensitivity of the parameters. Specifically, longitudinal polarization provides a more significant improvement compared to transverse polarization, with the enhancement being more pronounced for single-step decays than for multistep decays. With the expected statistics from the BESIII experiment, the estimated EDM sensitivities for $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{+}$ are on the order of $10^{-19}~e~\rm cm$, while those for $\Xi^{-}$ and $\Xi^{0}$ are $10^{-18}~e~\rm cm$. The upcoming STCF experiment is expected to improve these estimates by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. Furthermore, $CP$ violation in hyperon decays originates from weak-phase differences among partial-wave amplitudes. Based on a refined isospin analysis, we emphasize the non-negligible contribution of $\Delta I = 3/2$ amplitudes to $CP$ violation and advocate for increased theoretical attention to this aspect in future studies..</description>

      <title>No Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky Upholds Lorentz Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) would upend the foundations of modern physics. Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector. We examine an understudied yet phenomenologically rich LIV signature: compass asymmetries, where neutrinos of different flavors propagate preferentially along different directions. Using the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the abundances of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$ across the sky, we find no evidence of LIV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events. Thus, we place upper limits on the values of hundreds of LIV parameters with operator dimensions 2-8, tightening existing limits by orders of magnitude and bounding hundreds of parameters for the first time.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the sea: universality of the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we demonstrate that back-to-back dijet correlations in dilute-dense collisions involving a small-$x$ quark from the nuclear target can be factorised in terms of universal transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) for the sea quarks. Two building blocks are needed to construct all these TMDs at the operator level: the sea quark TMD operator which appears in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) or in the Drell-Yan process and the elastic $S$-matrix for a quark-antiquark dipole. Compared to SIDIS, the saturation effects are stronger for dijet production in forward proton-nucleus collisions, due to additional scattering in the initial and final state, effectively resulting in a larger value for the nuclear saturation momentum.</description>

      <title>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity -- ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08321v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped space neutrino oscillations and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the $W$ couplings originate from Majorana mass terms on the ultraviolet brane in the RS space. Tiny neutrino masses are generated by an inverse seesaw mechanism. The PMNS matrix in the normal ordering with $\delta_{CP}=\pi$ naturally arises consistently with the NuFit-6.0 analysis of neutrino oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background through Parametric Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric fluorescence in atomic or molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic neutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\nu^{}_{i} + M \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. Near the resonance, the rate is proportional to the square of the coherence time $T^{}_{\rm c}$ of the ensemble. For a nominal target volume of $5~{\rm m^3}$ (or $5~{\rm cm^3}$), the signal rate can reach $1~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for $T^{}_{\rm c} = 10~{\rm ns}$ (or $T^{}_{\rm c} = 10~{\rm \mu s}$). This event rate appears to be very promising in consideration of an even longer coherence time that is achievable in solid systems.</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons across thermal phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature has a significant effect on the properties of quantum field theories (QFTs) with a spontaneously broken symmetry, in particular on the massless Goldstone bosons that exist in the vacuum state. It has recently been shown using lattice calculations for a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ complex scalar field theory that the Goldstone mode persists even when the symmetry is restored above the critical temperature $T_{c}$, and has the properties of a screened excitation, a so-called thermoparticle. In this work, we continue the investigation of this theory by determining explicitly how the Goldstone mode evolves as the temperature is increased both below and above $T_{c}$. We find that the two phases of the theory are entirely characterised by the thermal dissipative effects experienced by the Goldstone mode, with the broken and symmetry-restored phases associated with weak and strong damping, respectively. These findings are consistent with the non-perturbative constraints imposed by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provide a new way in which to characterise thermal phase transitions in QFTs.</description>

      <title>TeV-scale scalar leptoquarks motivated by B anomalies improve Yukawa unification in SO(10) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common practice to explain deviations between data and Standard-Model (SM) predictions by postulating new particles at the TeV scale ad-hoc. This approach becomes much more convincing, if one successfully embeds the postulated particles into a UV completion which addresses other conceptual or phenomenological shortcomings of the SM. We present a study of an SO(10) grand unified theory which contains scalar leptoquark fields employed to explain the ``flavour anomalies'' in $b\rightarrow s$ and $b\rightarrow c$ decays. We find that the additional degrees of freedom improve the renormalization-group (RG) evolution of the SM parameters. In particular, the light leptoquarks modify the RG evolution of the Yukawa couplings such that successful bottom-tau unification becomes possible in a minimal SO(10) GUT with only a $126$-plet coupling to fermions. If we amend the Yukawa interaction of the minimal one-generation model with a second fermion multiplet and small flavor-violating terms, we find the flavour violation in the leptoquark couplings growing with the RG evolution while it stays small in the Yukawa interaction of the SM Higgs boson. By employing mass splittings among the members of the $126$-plet one can increase the effect and obtain large flavor violation in leptoquark couplings from tiny perturbations at the GUT scale, because the flavour-conserving limit is an unstable initial condition for the RG equations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the twist-2 matching of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) helicity parton distribution and fragmentation functions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD. This calculation entails the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) splitting functions govering the evolution of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). Within TMD factorization framework, we quantify the impact of radiative corrections by completing the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) prediction for lepton-hadron transverse momentum imbalance in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Our results provide the most precise theoretical input for probing the helicity structure and confined motion of quarks and gluons at future electron-ion collider (EIC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD in the low temperature and high density region, where a strong, first-order phase transition is expected beyond the critical end point. By solving the quark gap equation in the continuum QCD approach, we reveal the coexistence of the multi-phases both in the microscopic dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and also in the thermodynamic observables, which manifests the existence of spinodal decomposition during the first-order QCD phase transitions. We also analyse the interface structure of the co-exist Nambu and Wigner phases in the isothermal process during the first-order transition. In particular, the interface tension and interface entropy density are extracted from the isothermal trajectories, which further allows for an analysis on the formation of nuclear bubble, including the bubble radius and its stability at different temperatures. Our predictions may serve as useful inputs for further investigations in heavy-ion physics or astrophysics research.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of Higgs boson production associated with a neutrino pair at $e^+e^-$ colliders ($e^+ e^- \to h \, \nu \bar{\nu}$) at next-to-leading-order accuracy in both the Standard Model and the two-Higgs-doublet model. We show that these new physics effects will be observable in total and differential cross sections when compared with theoretical predictions that include electroweak corrections, even in the Higgs alignment limit. This highlights the potential of precision studies at future $e^+e^-$ colliders for searching new physics.</description>

      <title>Probing Geometrical NSI at the DUNE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the implications of a novel non-standard interaction (NSI) of neutrinos. This interaction is geometric in origin -- it arises because the propagation of fermions in curved spacetime induces torsion. This torsion is non-propagating and can be eliminated from the action, resulting in a four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. The new interaction modifies the behaviour of the neutrinos passing through matter by introducing additional coupling terms, resulting in a new component in the effective potential. As a result, the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter are altered. The relevant probabilities are computed using the Cayley-Hamilton formalism. We then numerically explore the potential to probe these torsion-induced NSI in the DUNE experiment. We obtain the bounds on the parameters characterizing the torsional effects. By selecting representative values of torsion parameters to which the DUNE experiment is sensitive, we analyse how these geometric interactions affect the experiment's sensitivity to determine neutrino mass hierarchy, the octant of the 2-3 leptonic mixing angle, and the CP phase. We also examine the new parameter degeneracies introduced by torsion effects and assess their impact on the overall sensitivities of DUNE. We find that the additional parameter degeneracies in the presence of torsion significantly affect the octant sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the partonic origin of the proton longitudinal spin using spin-dependent energy correlators measured in lepton-hadron collisions with longitudinally polarized proton beams. These observables encode angular correlations in energy flow and are sensitive to the spin-momentum structure of confined partons. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we analyze the correlation patterns in both nearly back-to-back and forward limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with longitudinally polarized transverse momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) and nucleon energy correlators (NECs). The TMDs and NECs allow consistent matching onto hard radiation regions and provide a comprehensive description of the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint next-to-next-to-next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic quantitative predictions for spin-dependent energy correlation patterns in the current and target fragmentation regions. The framework provides new theoretical insight into how the internal motion and spin of partons contribute to the formation of the proton longitudinal spin and offers an experimental paradigm for probing the interplay between color confinement and spin dynamics at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Measuring Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Electroweak Phase Transition and Higgs Self-Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the complete process of using space-based gravitational wave detectors to measure properties of the stochastic gravitational wave background resulting from a first order electroweak phase transition, to infer the parameters governing the phase transition dynamics as well as that of the underlying particle physics model, and eventually to make predictions for important physical observables such as the Higgs cubic and quartic self-couplings which are difficult to measure at colliders. This pipeline is based on a frequency domain simulation of the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, taking into account dominant instrumental noises and astrophysical background, where the data analysis is carried out using both the Fisher information matrix and Bayesian inference with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo numerical sampling. We have applied this framework to the simplest extension of the Standard Model, the singlet extension, and show the measured uncertainties of the parameters at various levels of inference, and show that the Higgs cubic and also the quartic coupling can be highly constrained from gravitational wave measurement. We also show the impact from the problem of parameter degeneracy, highlighting the corresponding limitation on parameter inference and on making predictions.</description>

Abstract: We determine the structure of both Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms up to four loops for $e^+e^-$ processes in perturbative QCD, where final-state jets are defined using the Cambridge--Aachen (C/A) clustering algorithm. The calculations are performed within the soft (eikonal) approximation using strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons for the case of the dijet invariant mass. The resulting expressions include full colour and complete jet-radius dependence. Compared to the anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ clustering algorithms, the C/A distribution minimises the impact of these non-global logarithms, making it the preferred choice among the three algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modified TM2 for Reproducing All Best-Fit Values of Neutrino Mixing Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As measurements of neutrino mixing angles continue to become more precise, it is increasingly likely that in the very near future a realistic neutrino mixing model will be required to precisely reproduce their best-fit values. In this study, a modified TM$_2$ mixing model which reproduces the best-fit values of all three neutrino mixing angles is proposed. The model reproduces the correct mixing angles within 1$\sigma$ of the current best-fit values and is robust against any future changes of the best-fit values.</description>

      <title>A simple generalization of the low-energy theorem for the effective Higgs-gluon-gluon coupling for the case of simultaneous decoupling of several heavy quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend in an extremely simple and straightforward way the well-known low-energy theorem for an effective Higgs-like scalar-gluon-gluon coupling [1] (as well as a similar one for for the effective coupling of the Higgs-like field to the light scalar quark currents) in QCD including arbitrary number of heavy quarks in addition to the light ones. The application of the generalized low-energy theorem allows the extraction of the four-loop effective Higgs-gluon-gluon coupling valid for extensions of the Standard Model with additional heavy quarks from the 3-loop results of [2] for the decoupling constant of $\alpha_s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of the retardation contributions to the hadronic quark interaction is performed in the coordinate space elaborating a classical electrodynamics procedure. The possibility of constructing a corresponding quantum operator is critically analyzed also performing some numerical matrix element calculations. A comparison of the model with the Feynman diagram calculation at tree level is studied, showing a substantial physical correspondence of the two models.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Oscillons as Closed Domain Walls in the $\mathbb Z_2$-Symmetric Two-Higgs-Doublet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify an oscillatory solution that exists as a long-lived, bubble-like closed domain wall in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry constraint, and these structures emerge naturally during the late stages of domain wall decay. \\ \\ The longevity of these structures is attributed to a potential landscape characterized by two distinct vacuum regions, the oscillating region lies in one vacuum, while the constant outer region lies in the other. The lifetime of the structure depends on the parameter in the Lagrangian, we identify a specific parameter space where radiation is suppressed, the solution exhibits a maximum lifetime that goes up to infinity. \\ \\ The simpler two-complex-field system is first used to introduce the mathematical requirements of the structure before extending it to the more physical but complex 2HDM. Further Numerical verification via Floquet analysis shows these structures are stable under perturbation.</description>

      <title>High precision heavy-boson-jet substructure with energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-correlator-based jet substructure has gained significant attention in recent years. One of the notable applications has been the study of multi-scale jets, where distinct physical scales manifest as features localised in different angular regions of the correlator. In this article, we present the first high-precision study of energy correlators on the simplest multi-scale jets: heavy boson jets. In such systems, the boson mass $M$ introduces an additional scale, generating a sharp peak at angles $\sim M/p_T^{\rm jet}$. We show that this feature can be computed directly by boosting the EEC spectrum measured in $e^+e^- \rightarrow {\rm hadrons}$ at the $Z$ pole. We identify that the peak arises from boosting the well-studied Sudakov factorisation governing the back-to-back limit of the two-point correlator. As a result, the feature is controlled by Sudakov resummation, not a Breit-Wigner-like structure in the $Z$ decay, and is therefore calculable with exceptional precision. We provide predictions at N$^3$LL$'$ accuracy for both $pp$ $Z$-tagged jets and $e^+e^-$ di-$Z$ production, and compare them to Herwig and Pythia simulations, finding close agreement. We also demonstrate that the boosted-$Z$ spectrum can be constructed directly by boosting OPAL measurements at the $Z$ pole. In this light, energy-correlator jet substructure on the hadronic decays of heavy bosons at the LHC provide access to clean, lepton-collider-like measurements across a wide range of effective centre-of-mass energies set by the boson jet transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Influence of Non-extensivity on the drag and diffusion coefficients of hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the drag and diffusion coefficients of various hadrons propagating through a hadronic thermal bath by employing the Fokker Planck equation within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. The nonextensive parameter $q$ accounts for the deviation from equilibrium and provides a more realistic description of the medium that is not perfectly thermalized. The hadronic bath, consisting of various mesonic and baryonic species, is characterized by different mass cutoffs that control the spectral composition of the medium. Our analysis shows that both the drag $F$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $\Gamma$ increases exponentially with temperature and increases systematically with increasing $q$ and mass cutoff. The spatial diffusion coefficient $D_x$ exhibits a decreasing trend with temperature $T$, $q$ and mass cutoff which highlights the significant influence of nonequilibrium effects and hadronic composition on the transport behaviour of hadrons, offering valuable insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the hadronic phase preceding freezeout in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we have studied the relaxation time of heavy mesons such as $D_0$, $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We found that the heavier mesons relaxed later in comparison to the lighter mesons in the hadronic medium.</description>

      <title>Revisiting stochastic inflation with perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in primordial cosmology is to understand the precise relation between the stochastic formalism and standard perturbation theory for light scalar fields in inflationary spacetimes. A complete correspondence between the two frameworks has remained elusive, even for a single self-interacting spectator field on a fixed de Sitter background. In this Letter, we revisit the assumptions underlying the derivation of the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations that form the basis of the stochastic approach. We show that the standard stochastic treatment is effectively equivalent to neglecting super-long-wavelength modes beyond the observable range described by these equations. Using perturbation theory, we quantify how these modes enter through virtual loop effects and demonstrate that, once treated consistently, they induce definite corrections to both the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>Boson Cloud Atlas: Direct mass measurements of superradiance clouds near black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature power spectrum at small scales between $3\times 10^{18}$ and $4.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial curvature power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$ based on observations of the cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, constraints are primarily derived from studies on primordial black holes (PBHs). In particular, for very small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, current limits come exclusively from investigations of the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBH radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after their evaporation. Recent findings also indicate that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}~\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, thereby affecting the primordial abundance of light nuclei. Moreover, it has been proposed that the ``memory burden'' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black holes, allowing light PBHs to survive until the present day. Based on recent theoretical advancements in black hole physics and existing constraints on the initial mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{3}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 2\times 10^{9}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $3\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 4.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, a regime that has been underexplored in previous literature.</description>

      <title>The axial-vector form factor of the nucleon in a finite box</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the axial-vector form factor of the nucleon in a finite box. Starting from the chiral Lagrangian with nucleon and Delta-isobar degrees of freedom, we address, at the one-loop level, the impact of two types of finite-volume effects. On the one hand, there are the implicit effects from the in-box values of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses. On the other hand, there are the explicit effects caused by computing the in-box loop integrals with the values of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses obtained in the infinite-volume limit. Selected numerical results are shown for three lattice ensembles. We show that the implicit effects dominate the in-box form factor. Our results are presented in terms of a set of basis functions that generalize the Passarino-Veltman reduction scheme to the finite-box case, such that only scalar loop integrals have to be performed. The techniques we developed are more generally relevant for lattice studies of hadronic quantities.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric and asymmetric cumulants as well as rapidity-even dipolar flow in ${}^{16}$O+${}^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV to explore $\alpha$-clustering phenomena in light nuclei within the viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework. Signatures of $\alpha$-clustering manifest in the anisotropic flow coefficients and their correlations -- particularly in observables involving elliptic-triangular flow correlations. We show that final-state symmetric and asymmetric cumulants -- especially $\mathrm{NSC}(2,3)$ and $\mathrm{NAC}_{2,1}(2,3)$ -- are sensitive to the initial nuclear geometry. Additionally, we observe a significant difference in rapidity-even dipolar flow, $v_1^{\text{even}}$, between $\alpha$-clustered and Woods--Saxon configurations in high-multiplicity events. These findings underscore the pivotal role of nuclear structure in heavy-ion collision dynamics and provide observables for distinguishing nuclear geometries, particularly in ultra-central collisions.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin correlation between quarks during QCD confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum is now understood to possess a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields and a condensate of virtual quark-antiquark pairs. The spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry, signaled by the nonvanishing quark condensate $\langle q\bar{q}\rangle$, is dynamically generated through topologically nontrivial gauge configurations such as instantons. The precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains a profound open question in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - the fundamental theory of strong interaction. High energy proton-proton collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum that subsequently undergo confinement to form hadrons, whose properties could serve as probes into QCD confinement and the quark condensate. Here, we report evidence of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs inherited from spin-correlated strange quark-antiquark virtual pairs. Measurements by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal a relative polarization signal of $(18 \pm 4)\%$ that links the virtual spin-correlated quark pairs from the QCD vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.</description>

Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing "final-parsec problem". Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of charged hadrons in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the elliptic flow coefficient, $v_2$, for charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$. Utilizing the AMPT model in both default and string melting modes, we examine the dependence of $v_2$ on transverse momentum, collision centrality, and particle type. Furthermore, we present $v_2$ scaled by participant eccentricity, which indicates a similar level of collectivity across different centrality intervals in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ within the AMPT-SM model. Our results indicate that the early-stage partonic phase significantly influences $v_2$, as observed by variations in parton scattering cross-section, while the later stage hadronic rescattering shows minimal impact. Comparisons with STAR and PHENIX experimental data show that the AMPT model effectively captures the transverse momentum dependence of $v_2$, underlining the importance of parton scattering mechanisms and the need for careful interpretation of experimental results in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation reaction around a static black hole surrounded by a Dehnen type dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.</description>

      <title>Pair luminosity and cooling of newborn strange star: unpaired quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was shown that pair luminosity of the newborn strange star with temperature of $10^{11}$ K may be as high as $L_\pm\simeq 10^{52}$ erg/s. The question remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature for a long time? To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of newborn strange star made of unpaired quarks taking into account its thermal conductivity and neutrino emission by the URCA processes $d\rightarrow u + e + \bar\nu_e$ and $u+e\rightarrow d+\nu_e$. Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases, reaching $10^{43}$ erg/s already at $10^2$ seconds. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.</description>

      <title>BaBy Cosmic Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.</description>

      <title>Phantom Mirage from Axion Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures have recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.</description>

      <title>Any Light Particle Searches with ALPS II: first science results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The light-shining-through-a-wall experiment ALPS II at DESY in Hamburg searched for axions and similar lightweight particles in its first science campaign from February to May 2024. No evidence for the existence of such particles was found. For pseudoscalar bosons like the axion, with masses below about 0.1 meV, we achieved a limit for the di-photon coupling strength of 1.5e-9 1/GeV at a 95% confidence level. This is more than a factor of 20 improvement compared to all previous similar experiments. We also provide limits on photon interactions for scalar, vector and tensor bosons. An achievement of this first science campaign is the demonstration of stable operation and robust calibration of the complex experiment. Currently, the optical system of ALPS II is being upgraded aiming for another two orders of magnitude sensitivity increase.</description>

      <title>Extracting light-cone wave functions from covariant amplitudes: a detailed study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjectured formula that systematically maps covariant off-shell amplitudes to light-cone wave functions in scalar field theory. Through an explicit comparison at one-loop accuracy, we establish its equivalence to the light-cone perturbation theory series, thereby validating the conjecture at this order. Applying this formula, we efficiently re-derive wave functions from known covariant amplitudes, bypassing both the conceptual complexities of light-cone quantization and the technical challenges of perturbative calculations in this framework. In addition to simplifying computations, this approach opens new avenues for applications in gauge theories and deeper explorations of the fundamental equivalence between covariant and light-cone quantization.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes and Conservative Binary Dynamics at $O(G^5)$ without Self-Force Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The post-Minkowskian amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>

      <title>Extracting Nucleon Resonance Transition GPDs from $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the process in which Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) excites a baryon resonance. In particular, we assess, in DVCS leading to the Roper resonance, the relative importance of a "background'' process in which a pion is first emitted by the nucleon, which then undergoes a DVCS event. Our numerical results, using realistic DVCS kinematics, indicate that there can be measurable interference effects. They suggest that this process could substantially modify the experimentally observed cross sections at CLAS12-like kinematics, motivating their inclusion in precision analyses of DVCS experiments. We further find that in spite of this background, the transition to a Roper-like state through DVCS does contribute significantly to the $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ cross section in some kinematic regions. This suggests that the creation of nucleon resonances via DVCS is a useful method for extracting information about the nucleon transition GPDs and the internal structure of the excited states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Bound and Resonant Doubly-Bottom Tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.</description>
