      <title>The Cauchy problem for gradient generalized Ricci solitons on a bundle gerbe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness of the analytic Cauchy problem for gradient generalized Ricci solitons on an abelian bundle gerbe and solve the initial data equations on every compact Riemann surface. Along the way, we provide a novel characterization of the self-similar solutions of the generalized Ricci flow by means of families of automorphisms of the underlying abelian bundle gerbe covering families of diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity.</description>

      <title>Geometric aspects of rank-3 vector bundles over surfaces and 2-plane distributions on 5-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study geometric aspects of horizontal 2-plane distributions on the 5-dimensional total space of a rank-3 vector bundle equipped with connection over a surface. We show that any surface in 3-dimensional projective space can be associated to such a geometric structure in 5-dimensions, and establish a dictionary between the projective differential geometry of the surface and the growth vector of the 2-plane distribution.</description>

      <title>Remark on a geometric inequality for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider noncompact smooth metric measure spaces $(M, g,e^{-f}dvol_{g})$ of nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature, i.e. $Ric + D^{2}f - \frac{1}{N}df \otimes df \geq 0$, for $0&lt; N \leq \infty$, in order to obtain geometric inequalities for the boundary of a given open and bounded set $\Omega\subset M$, with regular boundary $\partial \Omega$. Our inequalities are sharp for both the cases $N&lt; \infty$ and $N= \infty$, provided that the underlying ambient space has large weighted volume growth. The rigidity obtained for the $N=\infty$ case holds true precisely when $M \setminus \Omega$ is isometric to a twisted product metric and, as such, is a generalization of the Willmore-type inequality for nonnegative Ricci curvature from Agostiniani, Fagagnolo and Mazzieri to the context of weighted manifolds.</description>

      <title>Normal Curves in Sub-Finsler Lie Groups: Branching for Strongly Convex Norms and Face Stability for Polyhedral Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Lie groups equipped with left-invariant subbundles of their tangent bundles and norms on them. On these sub-Finsler structures, we study the normal curves in the sense of control theory. We revisit the Pontryagin Maximum Principle using tools from convex analysis, expressing the normal equation as a differential inclusion involving the subdifferential of the dual norm. In addition to several properties of normal curves, we discuss their existence, the possibility of branching, and local optimality. Finally, we focus on polyhedral norms and show that normal curves have controls that locally take values in a single face of a sphere with respect to the norm.</description>

      <title>Singular sets in noncollapsed Ricci flow limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the singular set $\mathcal{S}$ of a noncollapsed Ricci flow limit space, arising as the pointed Gromov--Hausdorff limit of a sequence of closed Ricci flows with uniformly bounded entropy. The singular set $\mathcal{S}$ admits a natural stratification: \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal S^0 \subset \mathcal S^1 \subset \cdots \subset \mathcal S^{n-2}=\mathcal S, \end{equation*} where a point $z \in \mathcal S^k$ if and only if no tangent flow at $z$ is $(k+1)$-symmetric. In general, the Minkowski dimension of $\mathcal S^k$ with respect to the spacetime distance is at most $k$. We show that the subset $\mathcal{S}^k_{\mathrm{qc}} \subset \mathcal{S}^k$, consisting of points where some tangent flow is given by a standard cylinder or its quotient, is parabolic $k$-rectifiable.
  In dimension four, we prove the stronger statement that each stratum $\mathcal{S}^k$ is parabolic $k$-rectifiable for $k \in \{0, 1, 2\}$. Furthermore, we establish a sharp uniform $\mathscr{H}^2$-volume bound for $\mathcal{S}$ and show that, up to a set of $\mathscr{H}^2$-measure zero, the tangent flow at any point in $\mathcal{S}$ is backward unique. In addition, we derive $L^1$-curvature bounds for four-dimensional closed Ricci flows.</description>

      <title>Discrete Koenigs nets, inscribed quadrics and autoconjugate curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Koenigs nets are a special class of discrete surfaces that play a fundamental role in discrete differential geometry, in particular in the study of discrete isothermic and minimal surfaces. Recently, it was shown by Bobenko and Fairley that Koenigs nets can be characterized by the existence of touching inscribed conics. We generalize the touching inscribed conics by showing the existence of higher-dimensional inscribed quadrics for Koenigs nets. Additionally, we study Koenigs d-grids, which are Koenigs nets with parameter lines that are contained in d-dimensional subspaces. We show that Koenigs d-grids have a remarkable global property: there is a special inscribed quadric that all parameter spaces are tangent to. Finally, we establish a bijection between Koenigs d-grids and pairs of discrete autoconjugate curves.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Lorentzian isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish optimal stability estimates in terms of the Fraenkel asymmetry with universal dimensional constants for a Lorentzian isoperimetric inequality due to Bahn and Ehrlich and, as a consequence, for a special version of a Lorentzian isoperimetric inequality due to Cavalletti and Mondino. For the Bahn--Ehrlich inequality the Fraenkel asymmetry enters the stability result quadratically like in the Euclidean case while for the Cavalletti--Mondino inequality the Fraenkel asymmetry enters linearly. As it turns out, refining the latter inequality through an additional geometric term allows us to recover the more common quadratic stability behavior. Along the way, we provide simple self-contained proofs for the above isoperimetric-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology, thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data, while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of "data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.</description>

      <title>Conditioning random points by the number of vertices of their convex hull: the bi-pointed case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pick $N$ random points $U_1,\cdots,U_{N}$ independently and uniformly in a triangle ABC with area 1, and take the convex hull of the set $\{A,B,U_1,\cdots,U_{N}\}$. The boundary of this convex hull is a convex chain $V_0=B,V_1,\cdots,$ $V_{\mathbf{n}(N)}$, $V_{\mathbf{n}(N)+1}=A$ with random size $\mathbf{n}(N)$. The first aim of this paper is to study the asymptotic behavior of this chain, conditional on $\mathbf{n}(N)=n$, when both $n$ and $m=N-n$ go to $+\infty$. We prove a phase transition: if $m=\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor$ where $\lambda&gt;0$, this chain converges in probability for the Hausdorff topology to an (explicit) hyperbola ${\cal H}_\lambda$ as $n\to+\infty$, while, if $m=o(n)$, the limit shape is a parabola. We prove that this hyperbola is solution to an optimization problem: among all concave curves ${\cal C}$ in $ABC$ (incident with $A$ and $B$), ${\cal H}_\lambda$ is the unique curve maximizing the functional ${\cal C}\mapsto {\sf Area}({\cal C})^{\lambda} {\sf L}({\cal C})^3$ where ${\sf L}({\cal C})$ is the affine perimeter of ${\cal C}$. We also give the logarithm expansion of the probability ${\bf Q}^{\triangle \bullet\bullet}_{n,\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor}$, that $\mathbf{n}(N)=n$ when $N=n+\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor$.
  Take a compact convex set $\mathbf{K}$ with area 1 in the plane, and denote by ${\bf Q}^{\mathbf{K}}_{n,m}$ the probability of the event that the convex hull of $n+m$ iid uniform points in $\mathbf{K}$ is a polygon with $n$ vertices.
  We provide some results and conjectures regarding the asymptotic logarithm expansion of ${\bf Q}^{\mathbf{K}}_{n,m}$, as well as results and conjectures concerning limit shape theorems, conditional on this event.
  These results and conjectures generalize B\'ar\'any's results, who treated the case $\lambda=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider versions of the Penrose singularity theorem and the Hawking horizon topology theorem in weighted spacetimes that contain weighted versions of trapped surfaces, for arbitrary spacetime dimension and synthetic dimension. We find that suitable generalizations of the unweighted theorems hold under a weighted null energy condition. Our results also provide further evidence in favour of a weighted scalar curvature that differs from the trace of the weighted Ricci curvature. When the synthetic dimension is a positive integer, these weighted curvatures have a natural interpretation in terms of warped product metrics.</description>

Abstract: This undergraduate thesis is focused on introducing the reader to concepts related to the search for topological obstructions to the existence of compact gradient shrinking Ricci soliton metrics in dimension four. It contains a discussion of the relevant background material for this subject. Furthermore, it introduces the problem of extending the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality to gradient shrinking Ricci soliton metrics and explores the limitations of current results in that direction. At last, the topic of compact Kaehler gradient shrinking Ricci solitons is introduced and the classification of these spaces is outlined in literature-study fashion.</description>

      <title>On a parabolic curvature lower bound generalizing Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport plays a major role in the study of manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below. Some results in this setting have been extended to super Ricci flows, revealing a unified approach to analysis on Ricci nonnegative manifolds and Ricci flows. However we observe that the monotonicity of Perelman's functionals ($\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{W}$, reduced volume), which hold true for Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, cannot be strictly generalized to super Ricci flows. In 2010 Buzano introduced a condition which still generalizes Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, and on which Perelman's monotonicities do hold. We provide characterizations of this condition using optimal transport and understand it heuristically as Ricci nonnegativity of the space-time. This interpretation is consistent with its equivalence to Ricci nonnegativity on Perelman's infinite dimensional manifold.
  More precisely, we prove that for smooth evolutions of Riemannian manifolds, this condition is equivalent to a Bochner inequality (resembling Perelman's Harnack inequality but for the forward heat flow), a gradient estimate for the heat flow, a Wasserstein contraction along the adjoint heat flow, the convexity of a modified entropy along Wasserstein geodesics, and an Evolutionary Variational Inequality (EVI). The optimal transport statements use Perelman's $L$ distance as cost, as first studied on Ricci flows by Topping and by Lott. We also consider dimensionally improved and weighted versions of these conditions. The dimensional Bochner inequality and all gradient estimates for the forward heat equation, along with the EVIs, appear to be new even for general Ricci flows, and are related to the Hamiltonian perspective on the $L$ distance. Most of our proofs do not use tensor calculus or Jacobi fields, suggesting the possibility of future extensions to more singular settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behrend, Liao, and Xu showed that differential graded (DG) manifolds of positive amplitude forms a category of fibrant objects. In particular, this ensures that notion of derived intersection -- more generally, homotopy fibre product -- is well-defined up to weak equivalences. We prove that the Atiyah and Todd classes of DG manifolds of positive amplitude are invariant under the weak equivalences.
  As an application, we study Hochschild cohomology of DG manifolds of positive amplitude defined using poly-differential operators, which is compatible with Kontsevich formality theorem and Duflo--Kontsevich-type theorem established by Liao, Sti\'enon and Xu. We prove that this Hochschild cohomology is invariant under weak equivalences.</description>
