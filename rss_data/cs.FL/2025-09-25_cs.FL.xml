      <title>Formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

      <title>Scalable and Approximation-free Symbolic Control for Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic control framework for enforcing temporal logic specifications in Euler-Lagrange systems that addresses the key limitations of traditional abstraction-based approaches. Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</description>

      <title>A Variety of Request-Response Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find, motivated by real-world applications, that the well-known request-response specification comes with multiple variations, and that these variations should be distinguished. As the first main contribution, we introduce a classification of those variations into six types, and present it as a decision tree, where a user is led to the type that is suited for their application by answering a couple of questions. Our second main contribution is the formalization of those six types in various formalisms such as temporal logics, grammars, and automata; here, two types out of the six are non-regular specifications and their formalization requires extended formalisms. We also survey tools for monitoring these specifications to cater for practitioners' needs.</description>
