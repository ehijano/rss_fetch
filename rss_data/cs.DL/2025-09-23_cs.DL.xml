      <title>A decentralized future for the open-science databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous and reliable access to curated biological data repositories is indispensable for accelerating rigorous scientific inquiry and fostering reproducible research. Centralized repositories, though widely used, are vulnerable to single points of failure arising from cyberattacks, technical faults, natural disasters, or funding and political uncertainties. This can lead to widespread data unavailability, data loss, integrity compromises, and substantial delays in critical research, ultimately impeding scientific progress. Centralizing essential scientific resources in a single geopolitical or institutional hub is inherently dangerous, as any disruption can paralyze diverse ongoing research. The rapid acceleration of data generation, combined with an increasingly volatile global landscape, necessitates a critical re-evaluation of the sustainability of centralized models. Implementing federated and decentralized architectures presents a compelling and future-oriented pathway to substantially strengthen the resilience of scientific data infrastructures, thereby mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring the long-term integrity of data. Here, we examine the structural limitations of centralized repositories, evaluate federated and decentralized models, and propose a hybrid framework for resilient, FAIR, and sustainable scientific data stewardship. Such an approach offers a significant reduction in exposure to governance instability, infrastructural fragility, and funding volatility, and also fosters fairness and global accessibility. The future of open science depends on integrating these complementary approaches to establish a globally distributed, economically sustainable, and institutionally robust infrastructure that safeguards scientific data as a public good, further ensuring continued accessibility, interoperability, and preservation for generations to come.</description>

      <title>Current policies governing editorial conflicts of interest are ineffective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research-active editors face a potential conflict of interest (COI) when handling submissions from authors who share the same affiliation or those who recently collaborated with the editor. Since perception of COIs arising from such editor-author associations may erode trust in science, some policies recommend, and others demand, recusal in such incidents. However, the effectiveness of such measures is unknown to date. To fill this gap, we analyze half a million papers from six publishers who specify the handling editor of each paper. We find numerous papers with editor-author associations, and demonstrate that such papers tend to be accepted faster. A quasi-experimental design exploiting policy changes at PNAS and PLOS reveals the limited effectiveness of current COI policies. A network neural embedding model reveals that requiring editors with potential COIs to recuse may compromise the suitability of the handling editor. Finally, an online survey experiment demonstrates that such COIs influence trust in the paper's finding, but public disclosure eliminates this effect.</description>

      <title>Archiving and Replaying Current Web Advertisements: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although web advertisements represent an inimitable part of digital cultural heritage, serious archiving and replay challenges persist. To explore these challenges, we created a dataset of 279 archived ads. We encountered five problems in archiving and replaying them. For one, prior to August 2023, Internet Archive's Save Page Now service excluded not only well-known ad services' ads, but also URLs with ad related file and directory names. Although after August 2023, Save Page Now still blocked the archiving of ads loaded on a web page, it permitted the archiving of an ad's resources if the user directly archived the URL(s) associated with the ad. Second, Brozzler's incompatibility with Chrome prevented ads from being archived. Third, during crawling and replay sessions, Google's and Amazon's ad scripts generated URLs with different random values. This precluded archived ads' replay. Updating replay systems' fuzzy matching approach should enable the replay of these ads. Fourth, when loading Flashtalking web page ads outside of ad iframes, the ad script requested a non-existent URL. This, prevented the replay of ad resources. But as was the case with Google and Amazon ads, updating replay systems' fuzzy matching approach should enable Flashtalking ads' replay. Finally, successful replay of ads loaded in iframes with the src attribute of "about:blank" depended upon a given browser's service worker implementation. A Chromium bug stopped service workers from accessing resources inside of this type of iframe, which in turn prevented replay. Replacing the "about:blank" value for the iframe's src attribute with a blob URL before an ad was loaded solved this problem. Resolving these replay problems will improve the replay of ads and other dynamically loaded embedded web resources that use random values or "about:blank" iframes.</description>

      <title>The ICML 2023 Ranking Experiment: Examining Author Self-Assessment in ML/AI Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted an experiment during the review process of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), asking authors with multiple submissions to rank their papers based on perceived quality. In total, we received 1,342 rankings, each from a different author, covering 2,592 submissions. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how author-provided rankings could be leveraged to improve peer review processes at machine learning conferences. We focus on the Isotonic Mechanism, which calibrates raw review scores using the author-provided rankings. Our analysis shows that these ranking-calibrated scores outperform the raw review scores in estimating the ground truth ``expected review scores'' in terms of both squared and absolute error metrics. Furthermore, we propose several cautious, low-risk applications of the Isotonic Mechanism and author-provided rankings in peer review, including supporting senior area chairs in overseeing area chairs' recommendations, assisting in the selection of paper awards, and guiding the recruitment of emergency reviewers.</description>

      <title>Automated Generation of Research Workflows from Academic Papers: A Full-text Mining Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science". However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive, structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772. Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of 0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel, process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving scientific paradigms.
