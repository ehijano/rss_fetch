      <title>Classifying Functions via growth rates of repeated iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a classification of real functions based on growth rates of repeated iteration. We show how functions are naturally distinguishable when considering inverses of repeated iterations. For example, $n+2\to 2n\to 2^n\to 2^{\cdot^{\cdot^2}}$ ($n$-times) etc. and their inverse functions $x-2, x/2, \log x/\log 2,$ etc. Based on this idea and some regularity conditions we define classes of functions, with $x+2$, $2x$, $2^x$ in the first three classes. We prove various properties of these classes which reveal their nature, including a `uniqueness' property. We exhibit examples of functions lying between consecutive classes and indicate how this implies these gaps are very `large'. Indeed, we suspect the existence of a continuum of such classes.</description>

      <title>Operational Methods Applied to the Spherical Mean and X-Ray Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of operational calculus to derive the operators associated with the spherical mean and related means of a function in $n$-dimensional space. These operators are then used to simplify the treatment and discussion of the means, i.\,e., to determine their power series expansion, to find the series solution to the corresponding inversion problem, to derive the associated differential equations that the means satisfy, or give meaning to fractional spherical means. Finally, we use the framework to derive the inversion formula of the X-ray transform in an operational manner.</description>

      <title>On the Identifiablility of Nonlocal Interaction Kernels in First-Order Systems of Interacting Particles on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a critical issue in nonparametric inference for systems of interacting particles on Riemannian manifolds: the identifiability of the interaction functions. Specifically, we define the function spaces on which the interaction kernels can be identified given infinite i.i.d observational derivative data sampled from a distribution. Our methodology involves casting the learning problem as a linear statistical inverse problem using a operator theoretical framework. We prove the well-posedness of inverse problem by establishing the strict positivity of a related integral operator and our analysis allows us to refine the results on specific manifolds such as the sphere and Hyperbolic space. Our findings indicate that a numerically stable procedure exists to recover the interaction kernel from finite (noisy) data, and the estimator will be convergent to the ground truth. This also answers an open question in [MMQZ21] and demonstrate that least square estimators can be statistically optimal in certain scenarios. Finally, our theoretical analysis could be extended to the mean-field case, revealing that the corresponding nonparametric inverse problem is ill-posed in general and necessitates effective regularization techniques.</description>

      <title>Characterization and dynamics of certain classes of polynomial vector fields on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all polynomial vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of degree up to three such that their flow makes the torus $$\mathbb{T}^2=\{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3:(x^2+y^2-a^2)^2+z^2-1=0\}~\mbox{with}~a\in (1,\infty)$$ invariant. We also classify cubic Kolmogorov vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and prove that they exhibit a rational first integral. We study `pseudo-type-$n$' vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and show that any such vector field is completely integrable. We prove that the Lie bracket of any two quadratic vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ is completely integrable. We explicitly find all cubic vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ which achieve the sharp bounds for the number of invariant meridians and parallels. We present necessary and sufficient conditions when invariant meridians and parallels of cubic vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ are periodic orbits or limit cycles. We discuss invariant meridians and parallels of pseudo-type-$n$ vector fields as well. Moreover, we characterize the singular points of a class of polynomial vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$.</description>

      <title>Expansion formulas for elliptic hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternate approach to obtaining expansion formulas on the lines of the well-poised Bailey lemma. We recover results due to Spiridonov and Warnaar and one new formula of this type. These formulas contain an arbitrary sequence as an argument, and are thus flexible in the number of parameters they contain. As a result, we are able to derive $19$ new transformation formulas for elliptic hypergeometric series. These transformation formulas appear to be new even in the basic hypergeometric case, when $p=0$.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e and Sobolev inequalities with variable exponents and log-Holder continuity only at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Sobolev-Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e inequalities in variable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$, with $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ a bounded John domain, with weaker regularity assumptions on the exponent $p(\cdot)$ that have been used previously. In particular, we require $p(\cdot)$ to satisfy a new \emph{boundary $\log$-H\"older condition} that imposes some logarithmic decay on the oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ towards the boundary of the domain. Some control over the interior oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ is also needed, but it is given by a very general condition that allows $p(\cdot)$ to be discontinuous at every point of $\Omega$. Our results follows from a local-to-global argument based on the continuity of certain Hardy type operators. We provide examples that show that our boundary $\log$-H\"older condition is essentially necessary for our main results. The same examples are adapted to show that this condition is not sufficient for other related inequalities. Finally, we give an application to a Neumann problem for a degenerate $p(\cdot)$-Laplacian.</description>
