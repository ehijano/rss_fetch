      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation of Large $N_f$ QED and Large $N$ Vector-like Theories in $d=2+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general class of large $N$ vector-like theories in $d=2+1$ in a Hamiltonian approach. We show that by using lightcone quantization and the $N\to\infty$ limit, we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian exactly and construct the eigenstates, spectral density, S-matrix, and form factors for the theory. For concreteness, we mainly focus on QED$_3$ at large $N_f$ as an explicit example. We comment on extending the approach to finite $N$ calculations.</description>

      <title>One-loop four-graviton string amplitude at finite $\alpha'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the one-loop four-graviton scattering amplitude in type-II superstring theory exactly in $\alpha'$. This result is achieved by combining physical insights into the $i\varepsilon$ prescription in string theory with a new technical application of the Rademacher expansion of modular integrals. We provide an implementation of our formula in $\texttt{C++}$ and use it to study the behavior of the amplitude at finite $\alpha'$ and in different kinematic regimes. Our analysis reveals a tension between explicit computations and the saddle point analysis of Gross and Mende in the high-energy limit and suggests the presence of additional saddle points.</description>

      <title>CFT Complexity and Penalty Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum complexity of conformal field theory (CFT) states has recently gained significant attention, both as a diagnostic tool in condensed matter systems and in connection with holographic observables probing black hole interiors. Previous studies have primarily focused on cases where all generators of the conformal group contribute equally to the cost of building a circuit. In this work, we present a general framework for studying the complexity of circuits in generic Lie groups, where penalty factors assign relative weights to different generators. Our approach constructs a metric on the coset space of quantum states, induced from a (pseudo-)Riemannian norm on the space of unitary circuits. The geodesics of this metric are interpreted as optimal circuits. The method builds on the formalism of (pseudo-)Riemannian submersions and connects naturally to other prescriptions in the literature, including cost function minimization along stabilizer directions and constructions based on coadjoint orbits. As a concrete application, we compute state complexity for states in one- and two-dimensional CFTs. For specific choices of penalty factors, our prescription yields a positive-definite metric with a viable interpretation as complexity; in other cases, the resulting metric is indefinite. In the viable regime, we derive analytic results when a specific penalty factor is turned off, develop perturbative expansions for small values of the penalty factors, and provide numerical results in the general case. We comment on the relation of our measure of complexity to holography.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily Negative Energy for Small Kaluza-Klein Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ADM energy of a Kaluza-Klein bubble of nothing is unbounded from below even if the size of the circle at infinity and the size of the minimal sphere at the bubble are fixed. We demonstrate this by presenting a family of explicit time-symmetric initial data satisfying these boundary conditions with arbitrarily negative energy. In particular, this is true for very small bubbles, which indicates that the standard Kaluza-Klein vacuum is more unstable than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies in $6D$ gauged supergravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists a rare class of R-symmetry gauged $N=(1,0)$ supergravities in six dimensions with gauge group $G\times U(1)_R$, where $G$ is semisimple with rank greater than one, and the number of tensor multiplets $n_T=1$, which are free from all local anomalies. We find new members of this family, in which $G$ contains up to four factors. We study the global anomalies of these models in a framework in which the Dirac quantization of the anomaly coefficients and the well-definedness of the Green-Schwarz anomaly counterterm in generic backgrounds play key roles, and we apply the anomaly freedom criteria that takes this into account as formulated by Monnier and Moore in \cite{Monnier:2018nfs}. To this end we use the result derived by Yuji Tachikawa in the appendix which states that the spin cobordism group $\Omega_7^{\rm Spin}(BG)$ vanishes for $G=G_1\times \cdots \times G_n$ where $G_i$ is $U(1)$ or any simple simply-connected non-Abelian compact Lie group. We also require correct sign for the vector field kinetic terms, and positive Gauss-Bonnet term. We find that among the models considered here only one of them fails to satisfy all the stated criteria. We also find that, in general, the requirement that the anomaly coefficients defined by the factorized anomaly polynomial are elements of a unimodular charge lattice imposes a constraint on the number of vector multiplets given by $n_{V}=8\ {\rm mod}\ 12$ for $U(1)_{R}$, and $n_{V} = 60$ for $Sp(1)_{R}$ gauged models.</description>

      <title>Two-photon emission from uniform acceleration: Unruh excitation, radiative decay, and field entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the two-photon emission process of a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. Using second-order perturbation theory, we derive the exact final quantum state of the field and classify the emitted photon pairs according to their directional decomposition into Unruh modes: right-right (RR), left-left (LL), and mixed (RL/LR) channels. The RR and LL contributions produce photon pairs within a single Rindler wedge, while RL and LR emissions generate entanglement across wedges. The first emission arises from a counter-rotating (Unruh) excitation, followed by a rotating Wigner-Weisskopf-like decay. Our results reveal how acceleration imprints entanglement and thermal structure on the radiation, offering new insight into quantum field theory in non-inertial frames and potential applications in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent graviton spectral function in Lorentzian quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully self-consistent computation of the graviton spectral function in quantum gravity, using the spectral renormalisation group for gravity put forward in arXiv:2111.13232v2 [hep-th] within a physical mass-shell renormalisation scheme. Here, self-consistency refers to the fact that the full non-perturbative spectral function is used in the diagrams, including the scattering continuum. We find a positive graviton spectral function with a massless one-graviton peak and a multi-graviton continuum with a close-to-quadratic spectral decay in the ultraviolet. Within the physical on-shell renormalisation scheme, the graviton satisfies the sum rule of an asymptotic state and features a unit total spectral weight. We briefly discuss the implications of the physical formulation for the computation of scattering processes and investigations of unitarity in asymptotically safe quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Scale without conformal symmetry in hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale without conformal symmetry corresponds to an inhomogeneous conservation equation for the virial current sourced by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Fluids that are just scale-invariant differ qualitatively from their conformal counterparts, and generic dissipation effects relax the hydrodynamic response over sufficiently long time scales. Remarkably, this holds true already at the ideal order. Spontaneously broken scale symmetry does not, in general, add any new mode to the hydrodynamic sector.</description>

      <title>Low-energy multi-photon scattering at tree-level and one-loop order in a homogeneous electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study low energy photons coupled to scalar and spinor matter in the presence of an arbitrary homogeneous electromagnetic field in a first-quantised (worldline) approach. Utilising a Fock-Schwinger gauge for both the scattering photons and homogeneous background, simple compact expressions are found for both the photon- and background-dressed effective action and propagator in scalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy limit allows identification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective homogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following from application of a suitable linearisation operator.
  To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a functional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green functions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a matrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a replacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop order can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy limit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum space matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for this path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and momentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in momentum space.</description>

      <title>The $\theta$-vacuum from functional renormalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological properties of a quantum mechanical system with $U(1)$-symmetry within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach. These properties include the vacuum energy structure and the topological susceptibility. Our approach works with a complexification of the flow equation, and specifically we embed the original symmetry into the complex plane, $U(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. We compute the effective potential of a given topological sector by restricting ourselves to field configurations with a given generalised non-trivial Chern-Simons numbers. The full potential is directly constructed from these sector potentials. Our results compare well with the benchmark results obtained from solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: We renormalize the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with an $O(N)$ symmetry to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^5)$ in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions and determine the anomalous dimensions of the fermion and scalar fields, $\beta$-functions as well as the scalar field's mass operator. These are used to construct several $N$ dependent critical exponents relevant for quantum transitions in semi-metals and in particular those connected with graphene in three dimensions when $N=2$. Improved exponent estimates for scalar fermion transitions on a honeycomb lattice, when $N=1$, as well as for $N=5$ are also given to compare with results from other techniques such as the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspects of superstring theory on black-strings backgrounds, corresponding to deformed BTZ black holes, formed near $k$ $NS5$ branes by $p$ fundamental strings, and single-trace $T\bar T+J\bar T+T\bar J$ holography, are presented. It is shown that for a particular asymptotic value of the $B$-field, the excitation energy of a long string plus its contribution to the energy of the black hole is that in $T\bar T+J\bar T+T\bar J$ deformed $CFT_2$ with $c=6k$. The excitation energy of a winding $w&gt;1$ long string plus its contribution to the background, a $w/p$ fraction of the black-hole energy, evolves according to that in a $Z_w$ twisted sector of a $p$-fold symmetric product of the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ dualities of supersymmetric boundary conditions in the three-dimensional supersymmetric field theories describing a semi-infinite M2-brane terminating on M5-branes. Specifically, we present dualities of boundary conditions for Abelian (quiver) ADHM theories and circular quiver Chern-Simons matter theories including the ABJM model. For the circular quiver Chern-Simons theories we take boundary conditions breaking a $U(1)_1 \times U(1)_{-1}$ gauge group to its diagonal subgroup which is decoupled. This can be generalized to break $U(1)_k \times U(1)_{-k}$, leaving a $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory. We find matching of the 't Hooft anomalies and supersymmetric half-indices for all the proposed dual boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Gauge Choices, Infrared Pitfalls, and Thermal Effects in Effective Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of effective potentials is critical for a range of phenomenological applications, including inflation, vacuum stability, and phase transitions. A drawback arises from the gauge-dependence of the effective potential. Furthermore, in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the effective potential exhibits infrared (IR) divergences in the limit of vanishing Goldstone masses. By considering the multiplicative anomaly that arises due to non-factorisation of elliptic operators in the Fermi gauge when computing the effective potential at one-loop order, we demonstrate that its gauge independence and IR behaviour are improved to the corresponding findings of Landau gauge calculations simultaneously. The latter are straightforwardly and transparently reproduced using an approach that employs the Heat Kernel technique, thereby providing a shortcut to reflect anomaly-related cancellations from the outset. Our findings generalise to the treatment of the effective potential at finite temperature. In particular, the Heat Kernel extends gauge independence to any value of the expansion in mass over temperature.</description>

      <title>2D CFT and efficient Bethe ansatz for exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work inaugurates a series of complementary studies on Richardson-Gaudin integrable models. We begin by reviewing the foundations of classical and quantum integrability, recalling the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the Richardson (reduced BCS) and Gaudin (central spin) models, and presenting a proof of their integrability based on the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and their generalizations to perturbed affine conformal blocks. Building on this foundation, we then describe an alternative CFT-based formulation. In this approach, the Bethe ansatz equations for these exactly solvable models are embedded within two-dimensional Virasoro CFT via irregular, degenerate conformal blocks. To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class, we develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in the Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix eigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid Newton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical applications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and hydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and reveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex rapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to finite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing energies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete Richardson model. We propose an application of the solver to Gaudin-type Bethe equations, which emerge in the classical (large central charge) limit of Virasoro conformal blocks. We conclude by outlining future directions: direct minimization of the Yang-Yang function as an alternative root-finding strategy; revisiting time-dependent extensions; and ... .</description>

      <title>The Chiral Limit of Fully Nonlinear Minimal Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity near the chiral limit where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes become null. We go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations. We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled in the chiral limit. We show that this is not the case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops, starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk Feynman diagrams. We briefly discuss the relevance of this pathology for the holographic duality between MMG and chiral 2D conformal field theories and comment on its possible resolutions.</description>

      <title>Root-$T\bar{T}$ Flows Unify 4D Duality-Invariant Electrodynamics and 2D Integrable Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework that connects four-dimensional duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics and two-dimensional integrable sigma models via the Courant-Hilbert and new auxiliary field formulations, both governed by a common generating function and a generating potential, respectively. Introducing two commuting deformation parameters, $\lambda$ (irrelevant) and $\gamma$ (marginal), we identify a universal class of $\gamma$-flows, including the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformation and its rescaled variants. Our approach generalizes conventional single-coupling structures via novel field transformations that extend to a two-parameter space ($\lambda$,$\gamma$) while preserving the root-$T\bar{T}$ flow condition for all $\gamma$-coupled theories. We construct several integrable models, including generalized Born-Infeld, logarithmic, q-deformed, and a new closed-form theory applicable to both electrodynamics and integrable systems. This unified framework, based on the unique form of the root-$T\bar{T}$ flow, systematically spans duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics in 4D and their exact 2D integrable counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a reconstruction of the quantum field theory (QFT) scattering framework: the path integral governs an interaction kernel region, while the Hilbert space encodes asymptotic free boundary conditions. We critically reexamine foundational assumptions and standard observables of QFT, raising the possibility of a unique vacuum. We also introduce a new thermodynamic perspective on vacuum loop contributions. The motivation behind certain vacuum energy cancellation schemes is reconsidered, and the applicability of QFT to spacetimes without asymptotic flatness, such as de Sitter (dS) space, is questioned at a fundamental level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform detailed calculations of electroweak radiative corrections to parity violating lepton scattering with a proton target up to quadratic and reducible two-loop level using a covariant approach. Our numerical results are presented at energies relevant for a variety of existing and proposed experimental programs such as Qweak, P2, MOLLER, MUSE, and experiments at the EIC. Analysis shows that such corrections at the Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) are quite significant and have to be included in searches of physics beyond the standard model, matching the increasing precision of the future experimental programs at low-energy scales.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 43\%, 31\%, and 4\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Primordial Power Spectrum and Bispectrum from Lattice Simulations of Axion-U(1) Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice. We measure the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum and bispectrum from our simulations, determining their dependence on both scale and axion-gauge coupling strength. Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sequential Circuit as Generalized Symmetry on Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed in Ref. [1]. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF. It reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation, which enables us to apply the peak theory to estimate the PBH function.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry and Anomaly for Gravitational Waves in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations admit a formulation closely analogous to the source-free Maxwell theory. In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an electric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this analogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components of perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that duality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields constitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the associated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the difference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized components of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and anti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when the gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We then investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality symmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it is anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between right- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum. This effect represents a chiral anomaly for massless spin-two fields, generalizing known results for fermions and spin-one photon fields.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Higher-Curvature Expansions Near the Horizon: Hawking Radiation from Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently proposed model incorporating a series of higher-curvature corrections allows for analytic black-hole solutions at each order of the expansion, with a fully regular black hole emerging in the limit of infinite number of terms. An important question that arises within this framework is how rapidly the series converges. For those classical observables, which are primarily determined by the geometry near the peak of the effective potential, it has been previously shown that the series converges remarkably fast, often within the first two orders. However, this rapid convergence does not extend to quantities such as Hawking radiation, which are highly sensitive to the geometry near the event horizon. Although each successive order yields a result that is significantly closer to that of the full infinite series, several terms are typically required to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the regular black hole in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This theoretical investigation examines gravitational lensing phenomena in Schwarzschild-like black holes (BHs) within Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity frameworks incorporating cosmic string (CS) and cloud of strings (CoS) topological configurations. We develop comprehensive analytical methodologies for investigating photon deflection angles and magnification characteristics in both Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity pierced by CSs (SKRCS) and Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity with CoS (SKRCoS) spacetime geometries through dual approaches: perturbative expansions yielding approximate solutions and exact elliptic integral formulations providing complete mathematical descriptions across parameter spaces. For CS configurations characterized by Lorentz violation (LV) and CS parameters, deflection angles exhibit systematic modifications through composite geometric factors, while CoS geometries demonstrate distinct deflection characteristics incorporating additional topological parameters that fundamentally alter light propagation dynamics. Magnification analysis reveals distinctive critical curve positioning modifications and amplitude scaling relationships enabling observational discrimination between exotic BH scenarios and conventional spacetime geometries. Strong field analysis utilizing established mathematical frameworks establishes logarithmic divergence coefficients characterizing fundamental scaling behavior in photon sphere proximity regimes. Observational constraints from Solar System precision tests restrict LV parameters within stringent bounds, while galactic-scale observations permit expanded parameter ranges for CS and CoS configurations.</description>

Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves on small scales are not tightly constrained by current cosmological observations, which allows for the possibility of large amplitudes at small scales. We investigate second-order tensor induced gravitational waves (TIGWs) sourced by primordial gravitational waves and present the corresponding corrections to the total energy density spectrum of gravitational wave. We analyze primordial gravitational waves with large amplitudes generated by various models at small scales. Our results indicate that when primordial gravitational waves on small scales sufficiently dominate the current PTA observations, corrections to the total energy density spectrum from second-order TIGWs may become pronounced in certain frequency bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one potential origin of emergent symmetries. In this work, we extend this theoretical framework to accommodate particles with arbitrary spins and/or arbitrary group representations. As case studies, we discuss recent efforts to test the entanglement-suppression conjecture in two hadron systems that exhibit possible emergent symmetries. The first concerns interactions involving spin-3/2 baryons, where entanglement suppression gives rise to symmetries such as $\text{SU}(40)$ spin-flavor symmetry. The second system involves low-energy scattering of heavy mesons, where entanglement suppression leads to an enhancement of the inherent heavy-quark spin symmetry to a light-quark spin symmetry, predicting additional siblings for the prominent exotic double-charm meson $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. These predictions should be confronted against experimental data and lattice results to further test the minimal-entanglement conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We introduce one-parameter families of spin chain ansatz wavefunctions constructed from chiral conformal field theory correlators on a torus, with the modular parameter $\tau$ serving as the deformation parameter. In the cylinder limit $\tau\to\infty$, these wavefunctions reduce to infinite dimensional matrix product states. In contrast, in the thin torus limit $\tau\to0$, they become finite bond dimension matrix product states (MPS). Focusing on families derived from the SU(2)$_1$ and SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models, we show that in the thin torus limit they reproduce known MPS ground states, such as those of the Majumdar-Ghosh and AKLT spin chains.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal response of both static and rotating black holes in anti de-Sitter spacetime. We perform the neutral scalar field perturbation for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. On the other hand, charged scalar field are used for perturbing Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman black holes. We find that the tidal Love number for all black holes are always nonvanishing due to the presence of cosmological constant. In contrast, tidal dissipation can vanish for certain conditions depending on the scalar field's frequency and the black hole's parameters.</description>

      <title>Biased Domain Walls and the Origin of Early Massive Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use the parameter-free velocity-dependent one-scale model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at $z \gtrsim 7$ as suggested by JWST data.</description>

      <title>Gravitons and Temperature Fluctuation Correlations from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary tensor perturbations are treated as arising from a bath of gravitons produced by quantum particle creation at the end of inflation. We calculate the correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations produced by these gravitons in a model with an infrared cut off. The CMB photons are emitted from within a last scattering shell of finite thickness in redshift. We find the correlation function in terms of the separation of a pair of spacetime points of emission in both angle and redshift. In both variables, there is a significant amount of anti-correlation. The anti-correlation minimum has a relative magnitude compared to the central correlation maximum of about 20% in angle and 50% in redshift.</description>

      <title>Shapes of magnetic monopoles in effective $SU(2)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic exploration of a general family of effective $SU(2)$ models with an adjoint scalar. First, we discuss a redundancy in this class of models and use it to identify seemingly different, yet physically equivalent models. Next, we construct the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit and derive analytic monopole solutions. In contrast to the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, included here as a special case, these solutions tend to exhibit more complex energy density profiles. Typically, we obtain monopoles with a hollow cavity at their core where virtually no energy is concentrated; accordingly, most of the monopole's energy is stored in a spherical shell around its core. Moreover, the shell itself can be structured, with several "sub-shells". A recipe for the construction of these analytic solutions is presented.</description>

      <title>Systematic approach to correlators in $T\bar{T}$ deformed CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate higher-order corrections to correlators in a general CFT (conformal field theory) with the double-trace $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Standard perturbation theory proves inadequate for this problem due to the intricate stress-tensor flow induced by the deformation. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel technique termed the conservation equation method. This method leverages the stress tensor's trace relation and conservation property to establish relationships between higher and lower-order corrections, and subsequently determine the correlators by enforcing symmetry properties. As an illustration, we compute first- and higher-order corrections to various types of correlators. Our results align with existing calculations in the literature and demonstrate the viability of our method for general CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on an important mathematical conjecture, together with hypothesis of homological mirror symmetry in the context of Landau-Ginzburg models, we show that a class of compound Du Val singularities do not admit a crepant resolution. Most of these singularities sit in the type cEn. This implies that those singularities are not dual to four dimensional N =1 superconformal quiver gauge theories through stacks of D3 branes placed at the singularities. We verify this statement on the physics side by enumerating consistent gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spectrum of the Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum (the highest-weight representation) in detail. The target spacetime of the Carrollian string has a generalized Carrollian symmetry, and it is composed of both Poincar\'e directions and Carrollian directions. We explicitly show that two homogeneous Carrollian superstring theories, one with compactified Poincar\'e direction and the other with compactified Carrollian direction, share the same BMS$_3$ symmetry, and their zero modes can be identified under the usual T-duality transformation. Moreover, we investigate the spectrum of a general Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum. As the string can still have nonvanishing winding along the spatial direction in the infinite radius limit, the spectrum of the Carrollian strings in the flat background is no longer truncated. We furthermore construct the vertex operators of gravitons and discuss their scattering amplitudes. We find that the form of 3-point amplitudes differs from that of the usual tensile superstrings only by a simple function, which reflects the ultra-local nature of Carrollian physics.</description>

      <title>First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poisson structures of the Poincar\'e group can be linked to deformations of the Minkowski space-time, classified some time ago by Zakrewski. Based on this classification, various quantum Minkowski space-times with coordinates Lie algebras and specific Poincare Hopf algebras have been exhibited by Mercati and called T-Minkowski space-times. Here we construct the star products and involutions characterizing the $\star$-algebras for a broad family of Lie algebras which includes 11 out of 17 Lie algebras of T-Minkowski spaces. We show that the usual Lebesgue integral defines either a trace or a KMS weight ('twisted trace') depending on whether the Lie group of the coordinates' Lie algebra is unimodular or not. Finally, we give the Poincar\'e Hopf algebras when they are compatible with our $*$-product. General derivation of such symmetry Hopf algebras are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>On internal mechanical properties of Electroweak Magnetic Monopoles and their effects on stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering properties of the energy-momentum tensor of the electroweak magnetic monopole and its Born-Infeld extension, we attempt to make comments on the stability of these configurations. Specifically, we perform a study of the behaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended field-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum tensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion for stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and applied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic monopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole, we also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite) internal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards the centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical criterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as is the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the short-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part, due to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast, the total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both radial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to rotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the CM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or hypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated over space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld case. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM monopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it does not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reformulate Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulae for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class $\mathcal{S}$ theories and corresponding BPS quivers, including those of wild type, as identities for generating series of symmetric quivers that represent dualities of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ boundary theories. We identify such symmetric quivers for both sides of the wall-crossing formulae. In the finite chamber such a quiver is captured by the symmetrized BPS quiver, whereas on the other side of the wall we find an infinite quiver with an intricate pattern of arrows and loops. Invoking diagonalization, for $m$-Kronecker quivers we find a wall-crossing type formula involving trees of unlinkings that expresses closed Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the corresponding 4d theories in terms of open Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the 3d theories and invariants of $m$-loop quivers. Using this formula, we determine a number of closed Donaldson-Thomas invariants of wild type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclidean Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space provides a natural framework for studying boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). We analyze the conformal boundary conditions of the critical O$(N)$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions using the $\epsilon$-expansion, and extract some BCFT observables through higher-loop calculations in AdS. Specifically, in the so-called "ordinary" universality class, we determine the free energy to four-loop order and the one-point function of the lightest O$(N)$ singlet operator to three-loop order. In the symmetry breaking "normal" universality class, we derive the two-loop free energy and compute the leading correction to the one-point function of the lightest O($N$) vector. We apply Pad\'e approximants to extract the corresponding conformal data in three dimensions. In particular, from a suitable dimensional continuation of the free energy in AdS, we obtain estimates for the boundary central charge of the BCFT in $d=3$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new model of a particle propagating in $4D$, ${\cal N}=1$ superspace that describes the dynamics of a continuous spin irreducible representation of the Poincar\'{e} supergroup. The model is characterized by two-component Weyl spinor additional even variables playing the role of extra coordinates. A canonical formulation, specific local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry, and a compete system of bosonic and fermionic constraints are derived. All bosonic constrains are first-class, while fermionic constraints are a mixture of first and second classes. Using additional variables inherent in to the model, we split the fermionic constraints into first and second classes in a covariant way. Quantization of the model is carried out according to Dirac prescription imposing all the first-class constraints and half of the second-class constraints (Gupta-Bleuler procedure) on the wave function. At quantization, the fermionic constraints are written in terms of spinor supercovariant derivatives acting on superfields. The corresponding wave function, which is either a chiral or antichiral superfield, depends on additional variables and obeys the superfield constraints that define the continuous spin irreducible representation of the Poincar\'{e} supergroup in the superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Goon-Penco (GP) relation was investigated on rotating charged black strings with an arbitrary cosmological constant. It has been demonstrated that the GP relation retains its form in the context of spacetimes described by cylindrical coordinates. In addition, the GP relation is derived in scenarios where the energy state parameters (including angular momentum $J$ and charge $Q$, etc.) are expressed as functions of the perturbation parameter $\eta$. This finding indicates that the GP relation is not only valid for spacetimes described by spherically symmetric coordinates, but also prevalent for non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, such as cylindrical coordinates. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that the GP relation is universal for spacetimes with arbitrary cosmological constants, irrespective of the adopted coordinate system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new particle model that describes the dynamics of a $4D,$ $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ continuous spin particle in $AdS_4$ superspace and is a generalization of the continuous-spin superparticle model in flat $4D$, $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace proposed in 2506.19709 [hep-th]. The model is described by $4D$, $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace coordinates together with commuting spinor additional variables, which are inherent ingredients of continuous spin models. The Lagrangian and the system of four bosonic and four fermionic phase space constraints are derived. The consistency condition for constraints imposes a restriction on supergeometry to be $AdS$ superpace. It is shown that the bosonic constraints are first-class constraints. A covariant procedure based on the use of additional variables is developed to divide the four fermionic constraints into first and second classes. It is proved that, unlike the flat case, only one fermionic constraint is a first-class constraint, while the other three are second-class constraints. In the flat limit, one of these second-class constraints becomes a first-class one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbit-averaged fluxes of energy and angular momentum generated by a compact binary system of nonspinning particles are obtained in a popular class of massless scalar-tensor theories with first-and-a-half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) accuracy, i.e., 2.5PN accuracy beyond the leading -1PN dipolar radiation. The secular evolution of the orbital elements (frequency and eccentricity) are then also obtained with 1.5PN accuracy. Three technical advances were necessary to obtain these results: (i) the decomposition of the scalar dipole moment as a Fourier series at 1PN order, along with the other moments at Newtonian order, (ii) the derivation of the formula for the passage to the center-of-mass frame at 2.5PN, including a novel hereditary term arising from the contribution of the radiation, and (iii) the complete treatment of the memory-like term appearing in the angular momentum flux. Moreover, as a byproduct of this work, I revisit in the Appendix the treatment in general relativity of the memory integral appearing at 2.5PN order in the angular momentum flux [arXiv:0908.3854], and find that the spurious divergence in the initial eccentricity $e_1$ found there is cured by a careful split between AC and DC terms.</description>

      <title>Quantum dust collapse with cosmological constant and methods for constructing conformal diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loop quantum gravitational collapse of the dust ball in presence of positive cosmological constant is investigated within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario. The dust ball interior is described within the framework of loop quantum cosmology, while its exterior geometry is determined by the differentiability of the spacetime metric at the dust ball surface and the assumption of the (vacuum) exterior to be stationary. In order to determine the global causal structure of the investigated spacetime a robust (numerical) method of constructing Penrose-Carter diagrams is built. Unfortunately the presence of cosmological constant does not cure the problems already present in the case of it vanishing -- the exterior geometry resembles that of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole, in particular featuring timelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.</description>

      <title>Massive particles tunneling from quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes and black hole entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tunneling process of massive scalar particles from a quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole using the tunneling approach proposed by Parikh and Wilczek. We compute the emission rate of these tunneling particles, which includes quantum correction terms compared to the result in classical General Relativity. These correction terms arise from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the scheme outlined in [1, 2], we derive the entropy of the black hole. Consistent with the universal black hole entropy formula in the context of quantum gravity, our findings include a logarithmic correction.</description>

      <title>Particle production induced by a Lorentzian non-commutative spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine particle production, evaporation, and greybody factors for a Lorentzian non-commutative black hole. We begin by analyzing particle creation for bosons, considering scalar perturbations to compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, which enable the determination of the Hawking temperature $T_{\Theta}$. Subsequently, we describe Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand metric representation, allowing the evaluation of divergent integrals via the residue method. This approach yields the particle creation density for bosonic modes. Next, we extend the analysis to fermions, obtaining the corresponding particle creation density. The black hole evaporation is then examined through the Stefan-Boltzmann law, leading to an estimate of the black hole's lifetime. In this context, we identify the presence of a remnant mass when the black hole reaches the final stage of its evaporation. Furthermore, we compute greybody factors for bosons, taking into account scalar, vector, and tensorial perturbations. Finally, we determine the greybody factors for fermions as well. Overall, compared to the Schwarzschild case ($\Theta = 0$), the presence of the non-commutative parameter $\Theta$ lowers the Hawking temperature and reduces the particle creation density for both bosons and fermions, causing the evaporation process to proceed more slowly. Additionally, $\Theta$ decreases the magnitude of the greybody factors for bosons and fermions across all perturbations considered in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Gravity in Gravitational Wave Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms on the gravitational wave memory effect. In certain quantum gravity theories and semi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects) exhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger waveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the detector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features following the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect signatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black holes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform templates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In this work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory arising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar ${\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features is model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real interferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is estimated subsequently. We further compute the physical fluxes associated to the echo at both the black hole horizon and null infinity and identify novel distinguishing features of the underlying reflectivity models in measurement data.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new look onto the thermodynamics of cold isospin QCD matter described within the quarkyonic framework, when confining forces are essential only for the momentum states close to the Fermi sphere and lead to formation of the quark-antiquark correlations with quantum numbers of pions. Within this picture cold isospin QCD matter is constituted by the Bose-Einstein condensate of pions and free (anti)quarks. We develop a simple confining model of pions existing as the lowest energy $P$-state of in-medium three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and use it to show that under the conditions of isospin QCD quarkyonic matter can onset at densities significantly smaller than the overlap density of pions. Using the experimentally established pion charge radius we demonstrate that the onset density can be even lower than two nuclear saturation densities. To analyze the lattice QCD data we develop a field-theory inspired model of quark-antiquark-pion matter with vector-isovector repulsion among pions and (anti)quarks. The quark substructure of pions, which is one of the key elements of the model, is accounted for within the one-loop no-sea approximation and leads to an effective medium dependence of the pion mass. The latter is shown to be crucial for providing asymptotic vanishing of the pion density and pion condensate, which reflects pion dissociation due to asymptotic freedom of QCD. The proposed quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD agrees with the results of perturbative calculations on reaching the conformal limit of QCD and with the data of lattice simulations, which supports its viability and physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Unitary reformulation of the thermofield double state and limits of cyclic multi-mode squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and uniqueness of squeezed vacuum states defined by annihilation conditions of the form $(a - \alpha a^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ and their multimode generalizations, with applications to the Thermofield Double (TFD) state in quantum field theory. For $N=1$ and $N=2$, we demonstrate that these conditions uniquely define the single- and two-mode squeezed vacua, generated by unitary squeezing operators. A key result is the unitary reformulation of the TFD state, expressed as a product of two-mode squeezing operators, ensuring invertibility and resolving the non-unitary paradox in the Minkowski--Rindler vacuum correspondence. Extending to cyclic annihilation conditions $(a_i - \alpha_i a_{i+1}^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ with $a_{N+1} \equiv a_1$, we find that non-trivial squeezed states exist only for $N=2$. For $N &gt; 2$, we establish a no-go theorem, proving no normalizable, non-trivial solutions exist, revealing a fundamental limit on cyclic multi-mode entanglement. These results highlight the bipartite nature of TFD-like entanglement and constrain multipartite generalizations in multi-region quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <title>Rescuing 331 bileptons from the Landau pole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the particles being searched for at the LHC beyond the Standard Model are bileptons, which are doubly charged gauge bosons. Bileptons are predicted by several Standard Model extensions, including the so-called 331 models with $\beta = \sqrt 3$. The minimal formulation of these models is generally plagued by a "low energy" Landau pole, which can undermine current predictions for TeV-scale bileptons. We analyze this issue and investigate the possibility to shift the Landau pole at higher energy scales by extending the troublesome minimal 331 models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with explicit CP violation offers a promising framework for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry while remaining consistent with stringent electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked set of two-loop diagrams that contribute to fermion EDMs in the NMSSM. Our analysis of the electron EDM shows that, for certain NMSSM specific CP-violating phases, these diagrams partially cancel existing contributions, thereby relaxing the associated constraints. In other phases, the diagrams dominate and tighten the bounds, which in turn necessitates more finely tuned parameters to reconcile successful baryogenesis with current EDM limits.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>
