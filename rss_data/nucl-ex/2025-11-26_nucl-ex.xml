      <title>Exploration for Astromers near $^{132}$Sn with the Canadian Penning Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear isomers can have significant impacts on astrophysical nucleosynthesis processes, with recent efforts demonstrating that the population of isomeric states with different half-lives may require separate treatment in reaction networks to accurately capture the differences in heating or in identifiable electromagnetic signals. Several potential so-called ``astromers'' in tin and antimony isotopes near doubly-magic $^{132}$Sn were identified and direct mass measurements of their ground and isomeric states were performed with the Canadian Penning Trap at Argonne National Laboratory's CARIBU facility, and their impact on astrophysical reaction rates and in reaction networks calculated. It was found that $^{129g,m}$Sn, with measured mass excesses of $-80 593.2(25)$ keV and $-80 557.4(25)$ keV, respectively, and an excitation energy of $35.8(35)$ keV, behaves as an astromer during neutron capture in the $i$-process and in the $r$-process.</description>

      <title>Studies of CPT symmetry in positronium decays with 192 plastic strip J-PET detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct test of the CPT symmetry is performed for the electromagnetic decays of ortho-positronium using the J-PET tomograph. We present the precise measurement of the CPT-sensitive angular correlation entailing the positronium spin and the momenta of its annihilation photons, surpassing previous studies utilizing the same detection system. Positrons originating from a $^{22}$Na source are emitted from the detector's center and subsequently form positronium atoms within the spherical chamber covered with porous material. Reconstruction of annihilation locations using the 192-strip J-PET detector makes it possible to determine the positronium emission direction, which defines the quantization axis along which positronium is polarized, without the application of external magnetic fields. The measurements were performed in total for 356 days resulting in an identification of 47.8 million events with ortho-positronium decays into three photons. The results are consistent with the exactness of CPT symmetry with measured asymmetry amplitude -0.00029 $\pm$ 0.00022 (stat.) and with statistical error four times smaller than the previous best measurement.</description>

      <title>Exploring the statistical properties of the neutron-deficient $^{109}$In isotope with the Oslo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear level density (NLD) and the $\gamma$-ray strength function (GSF) of the neutron-deficient $^{109}$In isotope were extracted for the first time with data from the $^{106}$Cd$(\alpha,p\gamma)^{109}$In reaction using a combination of the Oslo and the shape methods. Both quantities are consistent with those of neighboring Cd and Sn nuclei, but show substantial discrepancies with currently available model predictions. In contrast to earlier observations in the neighboring isotopic chains, $^{109}$In does not exhibit any significant enhancement of the dipole strength near the neutron separation energy. To interpret this feature, random-phase time-blocking approximation calculations have been performed for $^{109}$In and the neighboring $^{110,112}$Sn nuclei. The experimental data were also employed to estimate cross sections and rates of the radiative neutron- and proton-capture reactions, $^{108}$In($n,\gamma)$$^{109}$In and $^{108}$Cd($p,\gamma)$$^{109}$In, respectively, with the reaction code TALYS. Our ($p,\gamma)$ cross section is in excellent agreement with direct measurements over a wide range of proton energies, while the ($n,\gamma)$ cross section demonstrates notable deviations from predictions in the JINA REACLIB library. The new results on the statistical properties of $^{109}$In provide valuable constraints that may help address the problem of large model uncertainties compromising the accuracy of astrophysical $p$-process simulations.</description>

      <title>Calibration Plan for the SBC 10-kg Liquid Argon Detector with 100 eV Target Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) Collaboration is designing a new generation of low background, noble liquid bubble chamber experiments with sub-keV nuclear recoil threshold. These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture.</description>

      <title>First determination of fragmentation functions in an exotic-hadron candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there are experimental reports on exotic-hadron candidates, which have different quark configurations from ordinary $q\bar q$ and $qqq$ constituents. However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \ll M_s \sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\bar K$ molecule state at low energies. It sheds light on a new direction in exotic hadron physics.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified Understanding of the Dense Matter Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts to understand the equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter at supra-saturation densities have grown more sophisticated over the past decade, driven by a surge in high-precision data from both terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. While for the former, heavy-ion collisions (HIC) represent a unique opportunity to constraint the EOS in a controlled laboratory setting, the latter can be precisely probed thanks to the advent of multi-messenger astronomy (MMA). However, as we move away from our understanding drawn from individual sources and limited statistics to the era of precision physics with improved datasets, the need for a systematic way to combine them becomes clear. In this article, we trace the individual methods for extracting the EOS both for HIC and MMA. We then review the current state-of-the-art efforts to combine these individual information sources from Bayesian multi-source analysis, e.g., the Nuclear Physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) and Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) frameworks, and fully integrated EOS frameworks, i.e., the Modular Unified Solver for the Equation of State (MUSES) calculation engine. We highlight the scientific advances made possible by each step and outline the remaining challenges that must be addressed to build a coherent, predictive picture of dense nuclear matter across all relevant regimes.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES with Skyrme pseudopotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Extracting GPDs from Exclusive Photon Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new framework for studying generic $2 \to 3$ hard exclusive reactions, referred to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEP), has been introduced to provide a cleaner separation of the underlying physical mechanisms. In this work, we expand this formalism to the case of exclusive real-photon electroproduction off a nucleon, $e(\ell) + N(p) \to e(\ell') + N(p') + \gamma(q')$, which represents the classical channel for accessing generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in nucleons and nuclei. This extension enables a more systematic and physically transparent formulation of the reaction dynamics, paving the way for improved extractions of GPDs from experimental data as compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Latest results from CUORE and prospects for CUPID</title>

Abstract: The search for neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) is fundamental for investigating lepton-number violation, probing new physics beyond the Standard Model, and determining whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory of Rare Events), a cryogenic bolometric experiment at LNGS, studies 0$\nu\beta\beta$ in $^{130}$Te using 988 TeO$_2$ crystals. It is a milestone of cryogenic detector arrays with a tonne-scale detector operated for more than 7~years below 15~mK. Since 2017, CUORE has accumulated over 2.9~tonne-years of exposure, achieving one of the leading 0$\nu\beta\beta$ limits and one of the most precise two-neutrino double beta decay (2$\nu\beta\beta$) half-life measurements thanks to a detailed background reconstruction across a broad energy range. Building on CUORE's success, CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle ID) aims to significantly enhance its 0$\nu\beta\beta$ discovery sensitivity to $10^{27}$ yr in $^{100}$Mo, covering the Inverted Hierarchy of neutrino masses. It will employ lithium molybdate (Li$_2$MoO$_4$) crystals enriched in $^{100}$Mo, alongside germanium light detectors with Neganov-Trofimov-Luke amplification, enabling simultaneous heat and light readout for enhanced background rejection. CUPID will reuse CUORE's cryostat and infrastructure. Current efforts focus on detector performance validation, sensitivity studies, and finalizing the experimental design to maximize physics reach. This work presents the latest CUORE results and outlines the key milestones toward CUPID's realization.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter-Herman Visualization as a Diagnostic Tool for Systematic Effects in Electromagnetic Form Factor Extractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal charge and magnetization distributions of the proton are characterized by electromagnetic form factors GE and GM. They are experimentally extracted via Rosenbluth separation, which measures the elastic scattering of electrons and protons at multiple beam energies and angles at fixed momentum transfer Q2. Conventionally, form factor values are obtained by plotting reduced cross sections against the virtual photon polarization parameter epsilon and then extracting the slope and intercept of the best fit lines. An alternative visualization method, proposed by Hofstadter and Herman in 1960, plots GM2 vs. GE2 curves instead. The best fit values of GE2 and GM2 are immediately visible from the intersection region of the curves and their uncertainty bands. In this work, we apply both conventional and Hofstadter-Herman visualizations to classic 1994 SLAC elastic scattering data. We demonstrate that the Hofstadter-Herman method reveals previously obscured regions of form factor parameter space and highlights subtle experimental discrepancies among data sets. Our results motivate adopting this visualization method as a routine diagnostic cross-check at the Electron-Ion Collider and elsewhere to flag normalization shifts and related adjustments before they enter global fits.</description>

      <title>Gas-cell development for nuclear astrophysics motivated studies on noble gas targets and the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many astrophysical scenarios, alpha induced reactions on noble gas nuclei play a crucial role. Studying these reactions in the laboratory requires the noble gas atoms to be confined in a sufficient amount to allow the reactions. At Atomki thin-windowed gas-cell targets were developed and improved for studying alpha induced reactions on noble gases. Several stages of the gas-cell design used for activation experiments and lately a version to be used for particle scattering experiments will be presented.
  A new experimental study of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction with one of the activation gas-cell targets was performed. This reaction plays an important role both in the solar pp-chains and in big bang nucleosynthesis. The reaction cross section was measured in the past in several works, however, there are still energy regions lacking experimental data, rendering the extrapolations towards the astrophysically relevant energies uncertain. New experimental total cross section of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction was thus determined here in the energy range of $E_\mathrm{c.m.} = 2600-3000$ keV in about 50 keV energy steps. These results confirm the overall trend, and also the absolute scale set by the only one previous measurement in this energy range.
  In addition, two pilot experiments with the scattering cell were performed aiming to study the $^4$He($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^4$He and $^{124}$Xe($\alpha$,$\alpha$)$^{124}$Xe reactions at $E_\alpha = 18$ MeV. These studies benchmark the performance of the cell and detection system both for light and heavy noble gas targets.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Uncertainty Inequality and Breaking of Isospin Symmetry in Atomic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality is used to derive a rigorous lower bound to the amount of isospin impurities in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei, caused by the violation of isospin symmetry. The bound is fixed by the difference between the neutron and proton radii and the sum of the charge exchange monopole strengths. It can be used to check the consistency of advanced many-body calculations accounting for the breaking of isospin symmetry. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to derive an upper bound to the isovector dipole moment in terms of the amount of isospin impurities, providing an insightful connection between the violation of parity and isospin symmetries.</description>
