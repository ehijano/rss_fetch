      <title>Cosmic Expansion and Noether Gauge Symmetries in $f(R,T,R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work explores different evolutionary phases of isotropically homogeneous and flat cosmos filled with dust fluid in non-minimally coupled gravity. We consider different models of this gravity to discuss the presence of symmetry generators together with conserved integrals using Nother Gauge symmetry scheme. In most of the cases, we obtain temporal and scaling symmetries that yield conservation of energy and linear momentum, respectively. In the absence of contracted Ricci and energy-momentum tensors, we obtain maximum symmetries but none of them correspond to any standard symmetry or conservation law. We formulate exact solutions and construct graphical analysis of standard cosmological parameters. We observe realistic nature of new models via squared speed of sound, viability conditions suggested by Dolgov-Kawasaki instability and state-finder parameters. We investigate the behavior of fractional densities and check the compatibility with Planck 2018 observational data. The new models are stable and viable preserving compatibility with $\Lambda$CDM and Chaplygin gas models. It is concluded that most of the solutions favor accelerated cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of ringdown with excitation factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation formalism, the gravitational waveform is obtained by the convolution of the Green's function and the source term causing radiation emission. Hence, the ringdown properties, namely its start time, depend on both functions. The unknown time-shift encoded in the Green's function introduces a "time-shift problem" for ringdown. We study the ringdown time-shift problem by reconstructing a waveform via the excitation factors of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a spinning black hole. For the first time, we reconstruct ringdown with a significant number of QNMs weighted with their excitation factors and confirm its excellent convergence. We then precisely identify the ringdown starting time. We also find (i) that for moderate or large spins and $\ell=m=2$, QNMs should be included up to around the $20$th prograde overtones and around fifth retrograde overtones to reconstruct the ringdown waveform for the delta-function source with a mismatch threshold ${\cal M} &lt; {\cal O}(10^{-3})$. For higher angular modes, a more significant number of QNMs are necessary to reconstruct it; (ii) that the time shift of ringdown caused by the Green's function is the same for different $(\ell, m, n)$ modes but that nontrivial sources can change this conclusion. Finally, we demonstrate (iii) that the greybody factor can be reconstructed with the superposed QNM spectrum in the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Dissipative tidal effects to next-to-leading order and constraints on the dissipative tidal deformability using gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative tidal interactions can be used to probe the out-of-equilibrium physics of neutron stars using gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we present the first post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the orbital dynamics of a binary system containing objects whose tidal interactions have a dissipative contribution. We derive the 1PN-accurate equations of motion in the center-of-mass frame and a generalized energy-balance law that is valid for dissipative tidal interactions. We show how mass and energy loss due to the absorption of orbital energy change the orbital dynamics and derive the next-to-leading order correction to the gravitational wave phase of a binary system in a quasi-circular orbit containing initially non-spinning components. We then use this waveform model to constrain, for the first time, the individual dissipative tidal deformabilities of each of the binary components that generated the GW170817 event using real data. We find that the GW170817 data requires $\Xi_{1} \lesssim 1121$ and $\Xi_{2} \lesssim 1692$ at 90\% confidence, where $\Xi_{1,2}$ are the individual tidal deformabilities of the primary and secondary binary components that produced the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Generating tailored high frequency features in core collapse supernova gravitational wave signals applicable in LIGO interferometric studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a methodology based on an analytical model of a damped harmonic oscillator subject to random forcing to generate transient gravitational wave signals. Such a model incorporates a simulated linear high-frequency component that mirrors the growing characteristic frequency over time observed in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova gravitational wave signals. Unlike traditional numerical simulations, the method proposed in this study requires minimal computational resources, which makes it particularly advantageous for tasks such as data analysis, detection, and reconstruction of gravitational wave transients. To verify the physical accuracy of the generated signals, they are compared against the amplitude spectral of current LIGO interferometers and a 3D numerical simulation of a core-collapse supernova gravitational wave signal from the Andresen et al. 2017 model s15.nr. The results indicate that this approach is effective in generating scalable signals that align with LIGO interferometric data, offering potential utility in various gravitational wave transient investigations.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation through a spacetime containing thin concentric shells of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transmission of scalar, electromagnetic, and linearized odd-parity gravitational waves in a static spacetime characterized by a spherical distribution of matter in the form of thin concentric equidistant shells of equal mass. These shells connect Schwarzschild spacetimes of different masses between themselves, and they satisfy the Israel junction conditions with a polytropic-type equation of state for the surface energy-momentum tensor. We assume that the central region has zero mass, and we verify that the resulting spacetime is stable with respect to small perturbations of the shell radii as long as the gravitational field is sufficiently weak.
  We focus on the transmission of monochromatic waves emitted from the center and propagating through a succession of $N$ shells. To this purpose, we neglect the self-gravity of the waves and solve the Regge-Wheeler equation in the weak field limit of the background field. Analytical expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients are obtained and their dependency on the frequency, the number of shells and their mutual distance is analyzed. In particular, in the high-frequency limit, we observe that the reflection coefficient decays with the fourth power of the frequency. Increasing the number of shells initially produces oscillations in the transmission coefficient; however, as $N$ grows, this coefficient rapidly stabilizes at a constant positive value. We attribute this property to the fact that reflections are mainly determined by the surface density of the shells, which decreases as the inverse square of their radii.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation in quantum Hall system with an expanding edge: application of anomaly method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between gravitational anomalies and Hawking radiation of black holes was revealed by Wilczek and Robinson. In this study, we apply their method to an analogue de Sitter spacetime in the quantum Hall system with an expanding edge. Because this system is chiral, there is no need to impose the condition of ingoing modes near the horizon, which was assumed in the original method. Moreover, this system is structured so that the de Sitter space is sandwiched between two flat spaces, and although the effects of the anomaly would not appear in an ordinal de Sitter spacetime, they manifest themselves as boundary conditions between the de Sitter and the flat regions. By performing calculations under these boundary conditions, we obtain the flux of Hawking radiation in the outer flat region with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the de Sitter horizon.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tests of the dark energy models in Finsler-Randers Space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Finsler-Randers space-time offers a novel perspective on cosmic dynamics, departing from the constraints of General Relativity. This paper thoroughly investigates two dark energy models resulting from the parametrization of $H$ within this geometric framework. We have conducted some geometrical and physical analysis of the dark energy models in Finslerian geometry. First, We have derived the field equations governing the universe's evolution within the Finsler-Randers formalism, incorporating the presence of dark energy. Through this, we explore its implications on cosmological phenomena, including cosmic expansion, late-time behavior of the universe, cosmological phase transition, and a few more. Also, we employ observational data such as Cosmic Chronometer, Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, Quasar, and baryon acoustic oscillations to constrain the parameters associated with dark energy in the Finsler-Randers universe. Comparing theoretical predictions with empirical observations, we assess the model viability and discern any deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our findings offer intriguing insights into the nature of dark energy within this alternative gravitational framework, providing a deeper understanding of its role in shaping cosmic evolution. The implications of our results extend to fundamental cosmology, hinting at new avenues for research to unravel the mysteries surrounding dark energy and the geometric structure of the universe within non-standard gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Null Geodesics of a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Dehnen Type Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a novel black hole solution surrounded by a Dehnen-(1,4,0) type dark matter halo by embedding a Schwarzschild black hole within the halo, constituting a composite dark matter-black hole system. The thermodynamics of the resulting effective black hole spacetime is then studied with particular attention to the influence of the dark matter parameters on various thermodynamic properties. We examine the specific heat and free energy to assess the thermodynamic stability of the model. Furthermore, the null geodesics and the effective potential of light rays are studied to investigate how the dark matter parameters affect these geodesics and the radii of circular orbits. The stability of circular null geodesics is analyzed using dynamical systems and Lyapunov exponents, which represents the dynamical behaviour of the circular photon orbits.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from inflation/bouncing Universe in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the non-linear interactions within the VCDM model, a type II minimally modified gravity model with the same number of degrees of freedom as in General Relativity but not connected to the latter by field redefinitions. During an inflationary phase in the early universe, if the VCDM potential does not modify the slow-roll behavior of the inflaton field, we recover, up to the leading order, the standard results for the bispectrum in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, if the VCDM potential becomes dominant, the interactions can strongly deviate and even violate the Maldacena's consistency relation for the local non-Gaussianities. Furthermore, we apply the formalism to the recently introduced bouncing model in VCDM, and show that the bispectrum still respects current observational constraints. Future measurements on non-Gaussianities of the local type should provide the test ground for the model's validity.</description>

      <title>High-speed reconstruction of long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals using sparse dictionary learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring accurate long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could provide scientifically fruitful knowledge of massive black hole populations and robust tests for general relatively during the LISA mission. However, the immense computational requirements surrounding EMRI data processing and analysis makes their detection and analysis challenging. We further develop and explore a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm to expeditiously reconstruct EMRI gravitational waveforms lasting as long as 1 year. A suite of year-long EMRI systems are studied to understand the detection and accurate waveform retrieval prospects of the method. We show that full-year EMRIs can be reconstructed within 2 minutes, some with a false alarm rate less than 0.001/yr and with 1.16 day time windows with mismatch as low as 0.06. This provides an encouraging prospect to use the SDL method for long-duration GW searches like that for EMRIs in this study.</description>

      <title>Entangled pairs in evaporating black holes without event horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations into Hawking radiation often assume a black hole model featuring an event horizon, despite the growing consensus that such causal structures may not exist in nature. While this assumption is not crucial for deriving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a significant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that purify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate of Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due to Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event horizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped region bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners, accounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results and mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot "leak" out of the dynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where general relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This finding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to resolve the final fate of information.</description>

      <title>A formalism for the ambiguities of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ambiguities in the precise formulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the wavefunction of the Universe that arise due to different operator orderings in the quantum Hamiltonian. We first examine the simpler case of the 1-dimensional minisuperspace model and derive the inner product measure that renders the Hamiltonian hermitian. Based on this, we establish that the Hilbert space inner products and quantum probabilities are universal, free of any ambiguities, at the semiclassical level. Recasting the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a form invariant under field redefinitions of the minisuperspace variable, we show that all ambiguity functions are contained in a higher order scalar function, which can be used to define classes of models with universal predictions to all orders in $\hbar$. We then generalize to minisuperspace models of arbitrary dimension, upon the inclusion of an arbitrary number of scalar matter fields. We show that the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian in these cases provides a set of constraints, which can be used to cast the WDW equation in a covariant form and establish the universality of the inner products at the semiclassical level. In these cases as well, all ambiguity functions appear in a higher order scalar function of the minisuperspace manifold, which leads to distinct universality classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Curved Tetrahedron, Quantum Group Intertwiner Space, and Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the phase space of a constantly curved tetrahedron with fixed triangle areas in terms of a pair of Darboux coordinates called the length and twist coordinates, which are in analogy to the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for flat connections, and their quantization. The curvature is identified to the value of the cosmological constant, either positive or negative. The physical Hilbert space is given by the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ intertwiner space. We show that the quantum trace of quantum monodromies, defining the quantum length operators, form a fusion algebra and describe their representation theory. We also construct the coherent states in the physical Hilbert space labeled by the length and twist coordinates. These coherent states describe quantum curved tetrahedra and peak at points of the tetrahedron phase space. This works is closely related to 3+1 dimensional Loop Quantum Gravity with a non-vanishing cosmological constant. The coherent states constructed herein serve as good candidates for the application to the spinfoam model with a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present a repository of all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs' mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.</description>

      <title>A Precise Fitting Formula for Gravitational Wave Spectra from Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining a precise form for the predicted gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from a phase transition is a topic of great relevance for beyond Standard Model (BSM) physicists. Currently, the most sophisticated semi-analytic framework for estimating the dominant contribution to the spectrum is the sound shell model; however, full calculations within this framework can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale scans. The community therefore generally manages with fit functions to the GW spectrum, the most widely used of which is a single broken power law. We provide a more precise fit function based on the sound shell model: our fit function features a double broken power law with two frequency breaks corresponding to the two characteristic length scales of the problem -- inter-bubble spacing and thickness of sound shells, the second of which is neglected in the single broken power law fit. Compared to previously proposed fits, we demonstrate that our fit function more faithfully captures the GW spectrum coming from a full calculation of the sound shell model, over most of the space of the thermodynamic parameters governing the phase transition. The physical origins of the fit parameters and their dependence on the thermodynamic parameters are studied in the underlying sound shell model: in particular, we perform a series of detailed scans for these quantities over the plane of the strength of the phase transition ($\alpha$) and the bubble wall velocity ($v_w$). Wherever possible, we comment on the physical interpretations of these scans. The result of our study can be used to generate accurate GW spectra with our fit function, given initial inputs of $\alpha$, $v_w$, $\beta/H$ (nucleation rate parameter) and $T_n$ (nucleation temperature) for the relevant BSM scenario.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>

Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Topics in Weyl Geometry and Quantum Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham (FG) ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the ALAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory (QFT). The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves have crucial implications for the origin of the universe and fundamental physics. Using currently available cosmic microwave background data from Planck, WMAP, ACT and SPT separately or their combinations with BK18 B-mode polarization and DESI observations, we find the evidence of primordial gravitational waves at beyond the $5\,\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic thermodynamics of $4-D$ Kerr-Newman AdS black holes. We consider the conformal thermal states dual to KN AdS black holes and work out the corresponding thermodynamics in 10 ensembles. These ensembles are: fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$,fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p,C)$,fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$ and fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles. Here $\varphi$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\Omega$, $\mathcal{J}$, $p$, $\mathcal{V}$, $C$ and $\mu$ denotes the electric potential, electric charge, angular velocity, angular momentum, CFT pressure, CFT volume, central charge, and chemical potential respectively. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we observe a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble, we again find a first-order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\Omega&lt;\Omega_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. The fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble is characterized by a confinement/de-confinement phase transition. In the fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we see a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$, $\varphi&lt;\varphi_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. Finally, in the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p, C)$,$(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$,$(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles, we do not observe any critical behavior or phase transition.</description>

      <title>Null Infinity and Horizons: A New Approach to Fluxes and Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework tailored to degrees of freedom (DOF) of field theories that reside in suitable 3-dimensional open regions, and then apply it to the gravitational DOF of general relativity. Specifically, these DOF now refer to open regions of null infinity, and of black hole (and cosmological) horizons representing equilibrium situations. At null infinity the new Hamiltonian framework yields the well-known BMS fluxes and charges. By contrast, all fluxes vanish identically at black hole (and cosmological) horizons just as one would physically expect. In a companion paper we showed that, somewhat surprisingly, the geometry and symmetries of these two physical configurations descend from a common framework. This paper reinforces that theme: Very different physics emerges in the two cases from a common Hamiltonian framework because of the difference in the nature of degrees of freedom. Finally, we compare and contrast this Hamiltonian approach with those available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The equation of motion of an extended object in spacetime reduces to an ordinary differential equation in the presence of symmetry. By properly defining of the symmetry with notion of cohomogeneity, we discuss the method for classifying all these extended objects. We carry out the classification for the strings in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space by the effective use of the local isomorphism between $\SO(4,2)$ and $\SU(2,2)$. We present a general method for solving the trajectory of the Nambu-Goto string and apply to a case obtained by the classification, thereby find a new solution which has properties unique to odd-dimensional anti-de Sitter spaces. The geometry of the solution is analized and found to be a timelike helicoid-like surface.</description>

      <title>Affine Connections in Quantum Gravity and New Scalar Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.12633v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we will discuss the construction of covariant derivative operator in quantum gravity. We will find it is more perceptive alternative to use affine connections more general than metric compatible connections in quantum gravity. We will demonstrate this using the canonical quantization procedure. This is valid irrespective of the presence and nature of sources. The conventional Palatini and metric-affine formalisms, where the actions are linear in the scalar curvature with metric and affine connections being the the independent variables, are not much suitable to construct a source-free theory of gravity with general affine connections. This is also valid for many minimally coupled interacting theories where sources only couple with metric by using the Levi-Civita connections exclusively. We will discuss potential formalism of affine connections to introduce affine connections more general than metric compatible connections in gravity. We will also discuss possible extensions of the actions for this purpose. General affine connections introduce new fields in gravity besides metric. In this article, we will consider a simple potential formalism with symmetric affine connections and symmetric Ricci tensor. Corresponding affine connections introduce two massless scalar fields. One of these fields contributes a stress-tensor with opposite sign to the sources of Einstein's equation when we state the equation using the Levi-Civita connections. This means we have a massless scalar field with negative stress-tensor in Einstein's equation. This field brings us beyond strict local Minkowski geometries. These scalar fields can be useful to explain inflation and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Can we discern millilensed gravitational-wave signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes with ground-based detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millilensed gravitational waves (GWs) can potentially be identified by the interference signatures caused by $\sim\!O(10\textrm{--}100)~\textrm{ms}$ time delays between multiple overlapping lensed signals. However, distinguishing millilensed GWs from GWs generated by precessing binary black-hole mergers can be challenging due to their apparent similar waveform shapes. This morphological similarity may be an obstacle to template-based searches to correctly identifying the origin of observed GWs and poses a fundamental question, can we discern millilensed GW signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes? In this study, we investigate the feasibility of distinguishing between these GWs by performing a proof-of-principle injection study of simulated millilensed precessing GW signals, within the context of ground-based LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network detections. Our findings indicate that it is possible to differentiate between the two effects by comparing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) computed using templates based on different hypotheses for the target signal. We further show from the parameter estimation study that while lensing magnification is sensitive to precession, it is possible to identify millilensing in precessing GW signals with an SNR of 18. The recovery of precession in the presence of lensing is more challenging but improves significantly for signals with an SNR of 40. Nonetheless, neglecting millilensing effects results in biases in the recovered spins, revealing the importance of accounting for these effects in accurate GW signal analysis.</description>

Abstract: We develop the mathematics needed to treat the interaction of geometry and stress at any isotropic spacetime singularity. This enables us to handle the Einstein equations at the initial singularity and characterize allowed general relativistic stress-energy tensors. Their leading behaviors are dictated by an initial hypersurface conformal embedding. We also show that an isotropic Big Bang determines a canonical non-singular metric on and about the initial hypersurface as well as a cosmological time. This assigns a volume and energy to the initial point singularity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation with Non-Linear Memory: Breaking the Distance-Inclination Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the role of the non-linear memory effect in gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation, particularly we explore its capability to break the degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle in binary coalescence events. Motivated by the rapid growth in GW detections and the increasing sensitivity of GW observatories enhancing the precision of cosmological and astrophysical measurements is crucial. We propose leveraging the non-linear memory effect -- a subtle, persistent feature in the GW signal resulting from the cumulative impact of emitted gravitational waves -- as a novel approach to enhance parameter estimation accuracy. Through a comprehensive series of injection studies, encompassing both reduced and full parameter spaces, we evaluate the effectiveness of non-linear memory in various scenarios for aligned-spin systems. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of non-linear memory in resolving the inclination-distance degeneracy, particularly for events with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR $&gt;$ 90) for the current generation of detectors or closer than 1 Gpc in the context of future detector sensitivities such as the planned LIGO A$^\sharp$ upgrade. The results also suggest that excluding non-linear memory from parameter estimation could introduce significant systematics in future LIGO A$^\sharp$ detections. This observation will hold even greater weight for next-generation detectors, highlighting the importance of including non-linear memory in GW models for achieving high-accuracy measurements for gravitational wave (GW) astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study null hypersurfaces admitting a privileged vector field $\eta$ which is null and tangent at the hypersurface. We derive an identity that relates the deformation tensor of $\eta$ with tensor fields codifying the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the hypersurface. This is done without imposing restrictions either on the topology of the hypersurface or on the (possibly empty) subset of points where $\eta$ vanishes. We introduce a generalized notion of surface gravity $\kappa$ that extends smoothly the usual one to the fixed points. We also analyze the properties of the Lie derivative of the Levi-Civita connection along $\eta$. This analysis allows us to introduce three new notions of abstractly defined horizons (i.e. not necessarily viewed as embedded submanifolds) that we then compare with the standard concepts of non-expanding, weakly isolated and isolated horizons. The former generalize the latter to completely general topologies and to horizons admitting fixed points. Finally, we study the structure of the fixed points on these new horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing, focusing on axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. Positioning an optical transmitter in the lens's focal region, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited annular beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We analyze the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the projected beam's structure, estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, and assess the major noise sources. We determine detection sensitivity in both noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the transmitting lens's PSF. Our findings indicate that detecting lensed optical signals from nearby stars is achievable using established optical engineering technologies. A network of spatially distributed astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will enhance the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A precise interpretation of the Universe wave function is forbidden in the spirit of the Copenhagen School since a precise notion of measure operation cannot be satisfactorily defined. Here we propose a Bohmian interpretation of the isotropic Universe quantum dynamics, in which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is restated by including quantum corrections, which lead to a classical trajectory containing effects of order $\hbar^2$. This solution is then used to determine the spectrum of gauge-invariant quantum fluctuations living on the obtained background model. The analysis is performed adopting the wave function approach to describe the fluctuation dynamics, which gives a time-dependent harmonic oscillator for each Fourier mode and whose frequency is affected by the $\hbar^2$ corrections. The properties of the emerging spectrum are discussed, outlining the modification induced with respect to the scale-invariant result and the hierarchy of the spectral index running is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present the results from a search for gravitational-wave transients associated with core-collapse supernovae observed optically within 30 Mpc during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. No gravitational wave associated with a core-collapse supernova has been identified. We then report the detection efficiency for a variety of possible gravitational-wave emissions. For neutrino-driven explosions, the distance at which we reach 50% detection efficiency is up to 8.9 kpc, while more energetic magnetorotationally-driven explosions are detectable at larger distances. The distance reaches for selected models of the black hole formation, and quantum chromodynamics phase transition are also provided. We then constrain the core-collapse supernova engine across a wide frequency range from 50 Hz to 2 kHz. The upper limits on gravitational-wave energy and luminosity emission are at low frequencies down to $10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$ and $6 \times 10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$/s, respectively. The upper limits on the proto-neutron star ellipticity are down to 3 at high frequencies. Finally, by combining the results obtained with the data from the first and second observing runs of LIGO and Virgo, we improve the constraints of the parameter spaces of the extreme emission models. Specifically, the proto-neutron star ellipticities for the long-lasting bar mode model are down to 1 for long emission (1 s) at high frequency.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal coherence harvesting from quantum vacuum</title>

Abstract: It is well known that nonlocal coherence reflects nonclassical correlations better than quantum entanglement. Here, we analyze nonlocal coherence harvesting from the quantum vacuum to particle detectors adiabatically interacting with a quantum scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. We find that the harvesting-achievable separation range of nonlocal coherence is larger than that of quantum entanglement. As the energy gap grows sufficiently large, the detectors harvest less quantum coherence, while the detectors could extract more quantum entanglement from the vacuum state. Compared with the linear configuration and the scalene configuration, we should choose the model of equilateral triangle configuration to harvest tripartite coherence from the vacuum. Finally, we find a monogamous relationship, which means that tripartite l1-norm of coherence is essentially bipartite types.</description>

      <title>Classical gravitational anomalies of Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for classical Liouville field theory, diffeomorphism invariance, Weyl invariance and locality cannot hold together. This is due to a genuine Virasoro center, present in the theory, that leads to an energy\hyp{}momentum tensor with non-tensorial conformal transformations, in flat space, and with a non-vanishing trace, in curved space. Our focus is on a field-independent term, proportional to the square of the Weyl gauge field, $W_\mu W^\mu$, that makes the action Weyl-invariant and was disregarded in previous investigations of Weyl and conformal symmetry. We show this term to be related to the classical center of the Virasoro algebra. The mechanism uncovered here is a classical version of the quantum anomalous phenomenon: the generalization to curved space only allows to keep one of the two symmetries enjoyed by the flat space theory, either Lorentz (diffeomorphism) or conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the Stable Accretion Disk in Kerr and 4-D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravities: Comprehensive Analysis of Instabilities and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13847</link>

Abstract: The study of a disturbed accretion disk holds great significance in the realm of astrophysics, as such events play a crucial role in revealing the nature of disk structure, the release of energy, and the generation of shock waves. Consequently, they can help explain the causes of X-ray emissions observed in black hole accretion disk systems. In this paper, we perturb the stable disk formed by spherical accretion around Kerr and EGB black holes. This perturbation reveals one- and two-armed spiral shock waves around the black hole. We find a strong connection between these waves and the black hole spin parameter (a/M) and the EGB coupling constant (\alpha). Specifically, we found that as \alpha increases in the negative direction, the dynamics of the disk and the waves become more chaotic. Additionally, we observe that the angular momentum of the perturbing matter significantly affects mass accretion and the oscillation of the arising shock waves. This allows us to observe changes in QPO frequencies. Particularly, perturbations with angular momentum matching the observed $C-$ type low-frequency QPOs of the GRS 1915 + 105 source. Thus, we conclude that the possibility of the occurrence of shock waves within the vicinity of GRS 1915 + 105 is substantial.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the presence of non-conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behaviour of a chaotic system and its effect on existing quantum correlation has been holographically studied in presence of non-conformality. Keeping in mind the gauge/gravity duality framework, the non-conformality in the dual field theory has been introduced by considering a Liouville type dilaton potential for the gravitational theory. The resulting black brane solution is associated with a parameter $\eta$ which represents the deviation from conformality. The parameters of chaos, namely, the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity are computed by following the well-known shock wave analysis. The obtained results reveal that presence of non-conformality leads to suppression of the chaotic nature of a system. Further, for a particular value of the non-conformal parameter $\eta$, the system achieves Lyapunov stability resulting from the vanishing of both the Lyapunov exponent and as well as butterfly velocity. Interestingly, this particular value of $\eta$ matches with the previously given upper bound of $\eta$ known as Gubser bound in the literature. The effects of chaos and non-conformality on the existing correlation of a thermofield doublet state have been quantified by holographically computing the thermo mutual information in both the presence and absence of the shock wave. Furthermore, the entanglement velocity is also computed and the effect of non-conformality on it has been observed. Finally, the obtained results for the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity have also been computed from the pole-skipping analysis. The results from the two approaches agree with each other.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an Expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Resolving the Local Group mass tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work compares the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$CDM background. Using the Timing Argument (which links LG dynamics to LG mass) we find that the full $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. By the calibration of the IllustrisTNG simulations, the TA mass is shown to be biased high, and modified to be $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the MW Center Of Mass (COM) reduce the LG mass to be $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The overall estimated mass is compatible with the total sum of masses of MW and M31 (including their halos) estimated independently. The mass also is compatible with other estimations such as the Hubble flow, the Virial Theorem with the other dwarf galaxies and different Machine Learning methods based on LG-like pairs from simulations. These results resolve the controversy between the TA based estimations and the other probes in the literature.</description>

      <title>Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Loop Blow-up Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new model of string inflation driven by a blow-up K\"ahler modulus of type IIb compactifications with a potential generated by string loops. Slow-roll is naturally realized thanks to the fact that the blow-up mode is a leading-order flat direction lifted by string loops which are unavoidable and generate a plateau at large field values. We check that throughout the whole inflationary dynamics the effective field theory is under control. We perform a phenomenological analysis determining the exact number of efoldings by studying the post-inflationary evolution. We determine the values of the microscopic parameters which lead to agreement with CMB data, together with the prediction of a tensor-to-scalar ratio of order $r\sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Fundamental Interactions via Isotopic Shifts in Molecular Lattice Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements with ultracold atoms and molecules are primed to probe beyond-the-Standard Model physics. Isotopologues of homonuclear molecules are a natural testbed for new Yukawa-type mass-dependent forces at nanometer scales, complementing existing mesoscopic-body and neutron scattering experiments. Here we propose using isotopic shift measurements in molecular lattice clocks to constrain these new interactions from new massive scalar particles in keV$/c^2$ range: the new interaction would impart an extra isotopic shift to molecular levels on top of one predicted by the Standard Model. For the strontium dimer, a Hz-level agreement between experiment and theory could constrain the coupling of the new particles to hadrons by up to an order-of-magnitude over the most stringent existing experiments.</description>

      <title>New limits on warm inflation from pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) generated in the post-inflationary universe to infer new limits on warm inflation. We specifically examine the evolution of primordial GWs produced by scalar perturbations produced during the radiation-dominated epoch. For this purpose, we assume a weak regime of warm inflation under the slow-roll approximation, with a dissipation coefficient linearly dependent on the temperature of the radiation bath. We then derive analytical expressions for the curvature power spectrum and the scalar index, in the cases of chaotic and exponential potentials of the inflationary field. Subsequently, we compare the theoretical predictions regarding the relic energy density of GWs with the stochastic GW background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration through the use of pulsar timing array measurements. In so doing, we obtain numerical constraints on the free parameters of the inflationary models under study. Finally, we conduct a model selection analysis through the Bayesian inference method to measure the statistical performance of the different theoretical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity endowed with a positive cosmological constant and coupled to a conformal field theory of large and positive central charge. We study cosmological properties at the classical and quantum level. We provide a complete ADM analysis of the classical phase space, revealing a family of either bouncing or big bang/crunch type cosmologies. At the quantum level, we solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. In the semiclassical limit, we link the Wheeler-DeWitt state space to the classical phase space. Wavefunctionals of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin type are identified, and we uncover a quantum version of the bouncing spacetime. We retrieve the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction from the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory. To do so, we must select a particular contour in the space of complexified fields. The quantum information content of the big bang cosmology is discussed, and contrasted with the de Sitter horizon entropy as computed by a gravitational path integral over the two-sphere.</description>
