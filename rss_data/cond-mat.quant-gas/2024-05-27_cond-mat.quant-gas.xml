      <title>From inverse-cascade to sub-diffusive dynamic scaling in driven disordered Bose fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of universal dynamic scaling in an interacting Bose gas around the condensation transition, under the combined influence of an external driving force and spatial disorder. As time progresses, we find that the Bose gas crosses over three distinct dynamical regimes: (i) an inverse turbulent cascade where interactions dominate the drive, (ii) a stationary regime where the inverse cascade and the drive counterbalance one other, and (iii) a sub-diffusive cascade in energy space governed by the drive and disorder, a phenomenon recently observed experimentally. We show that all three dynamical regimes can be described by self-similar scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Dipolar bosons in a twisted bilayer geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, twisted bilayer systems such as bilayer graphene have attracted a great deal of attention as the twist angle introduces a degree of freedom which can be used to non-trivially modify system properties. This idea has been picked up in the cold atom community, first with a theoretical proposal to simulate twisted bilayers in state-dependent optical lattices, and, more recently, with an experimental realization of twisted bilayers with bosonic atoms in two different spin states. In this manuscript, we theoretically investigate dipolar bosons in a twisted bilayer geometry. The interplay between dipolar interaction and the twist between the layers results in the emergence of quantum states not observed in the absence of twist. We study how system properties vary as we change the twist angle at fixed distance between the layers and fixed dipolar interaction. We find that at a twist angle $\theta=0.1^{\circ}$, the observed quantum phases are consistent with those seen in the absence of twist angle, i.e. paired superfluid, paired supersolid, and paired solid phases. However, a slight increase in the twist angle to $\theta=0.2^{\circ}$ disrupts these paired phases in favor of a phase separation between checkerboard solid and superfluid regions. Notably, at a twist angle of $\theta=5.21^{\circ}$, the local occupation number follows the moir\'e pattern of the underlying moir\'e bilayers so that a periodic structure of insulating islands is formed. These insulating islands are surrounded by a superfluid.</description>

      <title>Unveiling quantum phases in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar gases using continuous matrix product state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the quasi-one-dimensional dipolar gases using continuous matrix product states techniques. Making use of the first- and second-order correlation functions, we find that the system supports the superfluid, super-Tonks-Girardeau, and quasicrystal phases according to the Luttinger liquid theory. We also map out the phase diagram on the parameter plane consisting the contact and dipolar interaction strengths. Furthermore, we compute the Luttinger parameter, the structure factor, and the momentum distribution of the system. Finally, we show that the predicted dipolar effect can potentially be observed in quasi-one-dimensional gases of polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermodynamics For Weakly Interacting Normal-Phase Quantum Gases: Equations of State For All Partial Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the thermodynamics for bosonic systems with weak $s$-wave interactions has been known for decades, a general and systematic extension to higher partial-waves has not yet been reported. We provide closed-form expressions for the equations of state for weakly-interacting systems with arbitrary partial-waves in the normal phase. Thermodynamics, including contact, loss rate, and compressibility, are derived over the entire temperature regime. Our results offer an improved thermometer for ultracold atoms and molecules with weak high-partial wave interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field corrections to the blueshift of a driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of vortices or phase slips, the phase dynamics of exciton-polariton condensates was shown to map onto the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which describes the stochastic growth of a classical interface. This implies that the coherence of such non-equilibrium quasi-condensates decays in space and time following stretched exponentials, characterized by KPZ universal critical exponents. In this work, we focus on the time evolution of the average phase of a one-dimensional exciton-polariton condensate in the KPZ regime and determine the frequency of its evolution, which is given by the blueshift, i.e. the non-equilibrium analog of the chemical potential. We determine the stochastic corrections to the blueshift within Bogoliubov linearized theory and find that while this correction physically originates from short scale effects, and depends both on density and phase fluctuations, it can still be related to the effective large-scale KPZ parameters. Using numerical simulations of the full dynamics, we investigate the dependence of these blueshift corrections on both noise and interaction strength, and compare the results to the Bogoliubov prediction. Our finding contributes both to the close comparison between equilibrium and non-equilibrium condensates, and to the theoretical understanding of the KPZ mapping.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Droplets at 3D-1D Crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate beyond-mean-field corrections to the energy of a one-dimensional Bose gas confined by a box potential with dipoles aligned along the unconfined direction. When the dipolar interaction reaches its critical strength, the system becomes unstable at the mean-field level. Then, similarly to the free space case, the beyond-mean-field contribution significantly alters the ground state of the system, leading to the formation of a self-bound atomic cloud known as a quantum droplet. Our analysis demonstrates that the beyond-mean-field correction can be understood as an effective three-body repulsion stabilizing the gas, preventing its collapse and leading to a finite-density solution. The quasi-1D dipolar droplets bring into play yet another subtle quantum effect: the effective three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Persistent non-Gaussian correlations in out-of-equilibrium Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian correlations emerge in a large class of many-body quantum systems quenched out of equilibrium, as demonstrated in recent experiments on coupled one-dimensional superfluids [Schweigler et al., Nature Physics 17, 559 (2021)]. Here, we present a mechanism by which an initial state of a Rydberg atom array can retain persistent non-Gaussian correlations following a global quench. This mechanism is based on an effective kinetic blockade rooted in the ground state symmetry of the system, which prevents thermalizing dynamics under the quench Hamiltonian. We propose how to observe this effect with Rydberg atom experiments and we demonstrate its resilience against several types of experimental errors. These long-lived non-Gaussian states may have practical applications as quantum memories or stable resources for quantum-information protocols due to the protected non-Gaussianity away from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Resummation-based Quantum Monte Carlo for Entanglement Entropy Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01490v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the recently developed resummation-based quantum Monte Carlo method for the SU($N$) spin and loop-gas models, we develop a new algorithm, dubbed ResumEE, to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) with greatly enhanced efficiency. Our ResumEE exponentially speeds up the computation of the exponentially small value of the $\langle e^{-S^{(2)}}\rangle$, where $S^{(2)}$ is the 2nd order R\'enyi EE, such that the $S^{(2)}$ for a generic 2D quantum SU($N$) spin models can be readily computed with high accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm with the previously proposed estimators of $S^{(2)}$ on 1D and 2D SU($2$) Heisenberg spin systems to reveal its superior performance and then use it to detect the entanglement scaling data of the N\'eel-to-VBS transition on 2D SU($N$) Heisenberg model with continuously varying $N$. Our ResumEE algorithm is efficient for precisely evaluating the entanglement entropy of SU($N$) spin models with continuous $N$ and reliable access to the conformal field theory data for the highly entangled quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Stability of fractional Chern insulators with a non-Landau level continuum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the resulting fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled $1d$ cold-atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and extension of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by a noise, leading to the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this analysis to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and obtain an analytical approximate solution of the defect density. Our analysis reveals that when the introduced noise is small, the model follows the previously known anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. On the other hand, as the noise increases, a new scaling behavior emerges. Furthermore, we identify the parameter that minimizes the defect density based on the new scaling, which allows us to verify how effective the already known scaling of the optimized parameter is.</description>

      <title>Novel Topological Insulators with Hybrid-order Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of several classes of novel topological insulators (TIs) with hybrid-order boundary states generated from the first-order TIs with additional crystalline symmetries. Unlike the current studies on hybrid-order TIs where different-order topology arises from merging different-order TIs in various energy, these novel TIs exhibit a remarkable coexsitence of first-order gapless modes and higher-order Fermi-arc states, behaving as a hybrid between the first-order TIs and higher-order topological semimetals within a single bulk gap. Our findings establish a profound connection between these novel $d$-dimensional ($d$D) TIs and ($d-1$)D higher-order TIs (HOTIs), which can be understood as a result of stacking $(d-1)$D HOTIs to $d$D with $d=3,4$, revealing unconventional topological phase transitions by closing the gap in certain first-order boundaries rather than the bulk. The bulk-boundary correspondence between these higher-order Fermi-arcs and bulk topological invariants acossiated with additional crystallline symmetries is also demonstrated. We then discuss the conventional topological phase transitions from these novel TIs to nodal-line/nodal-surface semimetal phases, where the gapless phases host new kinds of topological responses. Meawhile, we present the corresponding topological semimetal phases by stacking these unique TIs. Finally, we discuss potential ways to realize these novel phases in synthetic and real materials, with a particular focus on the feasible implementation in optical lattices using ultracold atoms.</description>
