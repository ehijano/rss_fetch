      <title>Winner-Pays-Bid Auctions Minimize Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any social choice function (e.g the efficient allocation) can be implemented using different payment rules: first price, second price, all-pay, etc. All of these payment rules are guaranteed to have the same expected revenue by the revenue equivalence theorem, but have different distributions of revenue, leading to a question of which one is best. We prove that among all possible payment rules, winner-pays-bid minimizes the variance in revenue and, in fact, minimizes any convex risk measure.</description>

      <title>Safe Pareto Improvements for Expected Utility Maximizers in Program Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents in mixed-motive coordination problems such as Chicken may fail to coordinate on a Pareto-efficient outcome. Safe Pareto improvements (SPIs) were originally proposed to mitigate miscoordination in cases where players lack probabilistic beliefs as to how their delegates will play a game; delegates are instructed to behave so as to guarantee a Pareto improvement on how they would play by default. More generally, SPIs may be defined as transformations of strategy profiles such that all players are necessarily better off under the transformed profile. In this work, we investigate the extent to which SPIs can reduce downsides of miscoordination between expected utility-maximizing agents. We consider games in which players submit computer programs that can condition their decisions on each other's code, and use this property to construct SPIs using programs capable of renegotiation. We first show that under mild conditions on players' beliefs, each player always prefers to use renegotiation. Next, we show that under similar assumptions, each player always prefers to be willing to renegotiate at least to the point at which they receive the lowest payoff they can attain in any efficient outcome. Thus subjectively optimal play guarantees players at least these payoffs, without the need for coordination on specific Pareto improvements. Lastly, we prove that renegotiation does not guarantee players any improvements on this bound.</description>

      <title>A Task-Driven Multi-UAV Coalition Formation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology, the problem of UAV coalition formation has become a hotspot. Therefore, designing task-driven multi-UAV coalition formation mechanism has become a challenging problem. However, existing coalition formation mechanisms suffer from low relevance between UAVs and task requirements, resulting in overall low coalition utility and unstable coalition structures. To address these problems, this paper proposed a novel multi-UAV coalition network collaborative task completion model, considering both coalition work capacity and task-requirement relationships. This model stimulated the formation of coalitions that match task requirements by using a revenue function based on the coalition's revenue threshold. Subsequently, an algorithm for coalition formation based on marginal utility was proposed. Specifically, the algorithm utilized Shapley value to achieve fair utility distribution within the coalition, evaluated coalition values based on marginal utility preference order, and achieved stable coalition partition through a limited number of iterations. Additionally, we theoretically proved that this algorithm has Nash equilibrium solution. Finally, experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm, compared to currently classical algorithms, not only forms more stable coalitions but also further enhances the overall utility of coalitions effectively.</description>

      <title>Online Contention Resolution Schemes for Network Revenue Management and Combinatorial Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem, products composed of up to L resources are sold to stochastically arriving customers. We take a randomized rounding approach to NRM, motivated by developments in Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an online policy that satisfies the resource constraints in any state, while (approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the fractional solution.
  OCRS cannot be naively applied to NRM or revenue management problems in general, because customer substitution induces a negative correlation in products being demanded. We start by deriving an OCRS that achieves a guarantee of 1/(1+L) for NRM with customer substitution, matching a common benchmark in the literature. We then show how to beat this benchmark for all integers L&gt;1 assuming no substitution, i.e., in the standard OCRS setting. By contrast, we show that this benchmark is unbeatable using OCRS or any fractional relaxation if there is customer substitution, for all integers L that are the power of a prime number. Finally, we show how to beat 1/(1+L) even with customer substitution, if the products comprise one item from each of up to L groups.
  Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to L items, and buyers being single-minded is akin to no substitution. Our final result also beats 1/(1+L) for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of L partition matroids. All in all, our paper provides a unifying framework for applying OCRS to these problems, delineating the impact of substitution, and establishing a separation between the guarantees achievable with vs. without substitution under general resource constraints parametrized by L.</description>

      <title>Towards Trust and Reputation as a Service in a Blockchain-based Decentralized Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the challenges inherent in implementing trusted services in the Society 5.0 initiative, we propose a novel trust and reputation service for a decentralized marketplace. We assume that a Smart Contract is associated with each transaction and that the Smart Contract is responsible for providing automatic feedback, replacing notoriously unreliable buyer feedback by a more objective assessment of how well the parties have fulfilled their obligations. Our trust and reputation service was inspired by Laplace Law of Succession, where trust in a seller is defined as the probability that she will fulfill her obligations on the next transaction. We offer three applications. First, we discuss an application to a multi-segment marketplace, where a malicious seller may establish a stellar reputation by selling cheap items, only to use their excellent reputation to defraud buyers in a different market segment. Next, we demonstrate how our trust and reputation service works in the context of sellers with time-varying performance by providing two discounting schemes wherein older reputation scores are given less weight than more recent ones. Finally, we show how to predict trust and reputation far in the future, based on incomplete information. Extensive simulations have confirmed our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Games for Interactive Manipulation Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robots become more prevalent, the complexity of robot-robot, robot-human, and robot-environment interactions increases. In these interactions, a robot needs to consider not only the effects of its own actions, but also the effects of other agents' actions and the possible interactions between agents. Previous works have considered reactive synthesis, where the human/environment is modeled as a deterministic, adversarial agent; as well as probabilistic synthesis, where the human/environment is modeled via a Markov chain. While they provide strong theoretical frameworks, there are still many aspects of human-robot interaction that cannot be fully expressed and many assumptions that must be made in each model. In this work, we propose stochastic games as a general model for human-robot interaction, which subsumes the expressivity of all previous representations. In addition, it allows us to make fewer modeling assumptions and leads to more natural and powerful models of interaction. We introduce the semantics of this abstraction and show how existing tools can be utilized to synthesize strategies to achieve complex tasks with guarantees. Further, we discuss the current computational limitations and improve the scalability by two orders of magnitude by a new way of constructing models for PRISM-games.</description>

      <title>Linear Programming Based Near-Optimal Pricing for Laminar Bayesian Online Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.05477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayesian online selection problem aims to design a pricing scheme for a sequence of arriving buyers that maximizes the expected social welfare (or revenue) subject to different structural constraints. Inspired by applications with a hierarchy of service, this paper focuses on the cases where a laminar matroid characterizes the set of served buyers. We give the first Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for the problem when the laminar matroid has constant depth. Our approach is based on rounding the solution of a hierarchy of linear programming relaxations that approximate the optimum online solution with any degree of accuracy, plus a concentration argument showing that rounding incurs a small loss. We also study another variation, which we call the production-constrained problem. The allowable set of served buyers is characterized by a collection of production and shipping constraints that form a particular example of a laminar matroid. Using a similar LP-based approach, we design a PTAS for this problem, although in this special case the depth of the underlying laminar matroid is not necessarily a constant. The analysis exploits the negative dependency of the optimum selection rule in the lower levels of the laminar family. Finally, to demonstrate the generality of our technique, we employ the linear programming-based approach employed in the paper to re-derive some of the classic prophet inequalities known in the literature -- as a side result.</description>

      <title>The outcomes of generative AI are exactly the Nash equilibria of a non-potential game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we show that the asymptotic outcomes of both shallow and deep neural networks such as those used in BloombergGPT to generate economic time series are exactly the Nash equilibria of a non-potential game. We then design and analyze deep neural network algorithms that converge to these equilibria. The methodology is extended to federated deep neural networks between clusters of regional servers and on-device clients. Finally, the variational inequalities behind large language models including encoder-decoder related transformers are established.</description>

      <title>Fast, Fair and Truthful Distributed Stable Matching for Common Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable matching is a fundamental problem studied both in economics and computer science. The task is to find a matching between two sides of agents that have preferences over who they want to be matched with. A matching is stable if no pair of agents prefer each other over their current matches. The deferred acceptance algorithm of Gale and Shapley solves this problem in polynomial time. Further, it is a mechanism: the proposing side in the algorithm is always incentivised to report their preferences truthfully. The deferred acceptance algorithm has a natural interpretation as a distributed algorithm (and thus a distributed mechanism). However, the algorithm is slow in the worst case and it is known that the stable matching problem cannot be solved efficiently in the distributed setting. In this work we study a natural special case of the stable matching problem where all agents on one side share common preferences. We show that in this case the deferred acceptance algorithm does yield a fast and truthful distributed mechanism for finding a stable matching. We show how algorithms for sampling random colorings can be used to break ties fairly and extend the results to fractional stable matching.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Learning Algorithm for Unknown Zero-sum Stochastic Games with an Arbitrary Opponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.03396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning for Zero-sum Stochastic Games (PSRL-ZSG), the first online learning algorithm that achieves Bayesian regret bound of $O(HS\sqrt{AT})$ in the infinite-horizon zero-sum stochastic games with average-reward criterion. Here $H$ is an upper bound on the span of the bias function, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of joint actions and $T$ is the horizon. We consider the online setting where the opponent can not be controlled and can take any arbitrary time-adaptive history-dependent strategy. Our regret bound improves on the best existing regret bound of $O(\sqrt[3]{DS^2AT^2})$ by Wei et al. (2017) under the same assumption and matches the theoretical lower bound in $T$.</description>

      <title>On marginal feature attributions of tree-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their power and ease of use, tree-based machine learning models, such as random forests and gradient-boosted tree ensembles, have become very popular. To interpret them, local feature attributions based on marginal expectations, e.g. marginal (interventional) Shapley, Owen or Banzhaf values, may be employed. Such methods are true to the model and implementation invariant, i.e. dependent only on the input-output function of the model. We contrast this with the popular TreeSHAP algorithm by presenting two (statistically similar) decision trees that compute the exact same function for which the "path-dependent" TreeSHAP yields different rankings of features, whereas the marginal Shapley values coincide. Furthermore, we discuss how the internal structure of tree-based models may be leveraged to help with computing their marginal feature attributions according to a linear game value. One important observation is that these are simple (piecewise-constant) functions with respect to a certain grid partition of the input space determined by the trained model. Another crucial observation, showcased by experiments with XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost libraries, is that only a portion of all features appears in a tree from the ensemble. Thus, the complexity of computing marginal Shapley (or Owen or Banzhaf) feature attributions may be reduced. This remains valid for a broader class of game values which we shall axiomatically characterize. A prime example is the case of CatBoost models where the trees are oblivious (symmetric) and the number of features in each of them is no larger than the depth. We exploit the symmetry to derive an explicit formula, with improved complexity and only in terms of the internal model parameters, for marginal Shapley (and Banzhaf and Owen) values of CatBoost models. This results in a fast, accurate algorithm for estimating these feature attributions.</description>
