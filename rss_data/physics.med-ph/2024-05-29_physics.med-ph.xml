      <title>Motion-Informed Deep Learning for Brain MR Image Reconstruction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion artifacts in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are one of the frequently occurring artifacts due to patient movements during scanning. Motion is estimated to be present in approximately 30% of clinical MRI scans; however, motion has not been explicitly modeled within deep learning image reconstruction models. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective for both the image reconstruction task and the motion correction task, but the two tasks are considered separately. The image reconstruction task involves removing undersampling artifacts such as noise and aliasing artifacts, whereas motion correction involves removing artifacts including blurring, ghosting, and ringing. In this work, we propose a novel method to simultaneously accelerate imaging and correct motion. This is achieved by integrating a motion module into the deep learning-based MRI reconstruction process, enabling real-time detection and correction of motion. We model motion as a tightly integrated auxiliary layer in the deep learning model during training, making the deep learning model 'motion-informed'. During inference, image reconstruction is performed from undersampled raw k-space data using a trained motion-informed DL model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed motion-informed deep learning image reconstruction network outperformed the conventional image reconstruction network for motion-degraded MRI datasets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the strain-induced softening behaviour in hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Usually, the strain-induced softening behaviour observed in the differential modulus $K(T,\gamma)$ of hydrogels has been attributed to the breakage of internal structures of the network, such as the cross-links that bind together the polymer chains. Here we consider a stress-strain relationship that we have recently derived from a coarse-grained model to demonstrate that no rupture of the network is needed for rubber-like gels to present such behaviour. In particular, we show that, in some cases, the decreasing of $K(T,\gamma)$ as a function of the strain $\gamma$ is closely related to the energy-related contribution to the elastic modulus that has been experimentally observed, e.g., for tetra-PEG hydrogels. Thus, our results suggest that, instead of the breakage of structures, the softening behaviour can be also related to the effective interaction between the chains in the network and their neighbouring solvent molecules. Comparison to experimental data determined for several hydrogels is included to illustrate that behaviour and to validate our approach.</description>
