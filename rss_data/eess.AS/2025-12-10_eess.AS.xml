      <title>An Adaptive Method for Target Curve Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the "Interactive Differential Evolution" (IDE) algorithm to the audio domain for the task of identifying the preferred over-the-ear headphone frequency response target among consumers. The method is based on data collection using an adaptive paired rating listening test paradigm (paired comparison with a scale). The IDE algorithm and its parameters are explained in detail. Additionally, data collected from three listening experiments with more than 20 consumers is presented, and the algorithm's performance in this untested domain is investigated on the basis of two convergence measures. The results indicate that this method can converge and may ease the task of 'extracting' frequency response preference from untrained consumers.</description>

      <title>BUT Systems for Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection in the ESDD 2026 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the BUT submission to the ESDD 2026 Challenge, specifically focusing on Track 1: Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection with Unseen Generators. To address the critical challenge of generalizing to audio generated by unseen synthesis algorithms, we propose a robust ensemble framework leveraging diverse Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of general audio SSL models (including BEATs, EAT, and Dasheng) and speech-specific SSLs. These front-ends are coupled with a lightweight Multi-Head Factorized Attention (MHFA) back-end to capture discriminative representations. Furthermore, we introduce a feature domain augmentation strategy based on distribution uncertainty modeling to enhance model robustness against unseen spectral distortions. All models are trained exclusively on the official EnvSDD data, without using any external resources. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: our best single system achieved Equal Error Rates (EER) of 0.00\%, 4.60\%, and 4.80\% on the Development, Progress (Track 1), and Final Evaluation sets, respectively. The fusion system further improved generalization, yielding EERs of 0.00\%, 3.52\%, and 4.38\% across the same partitions.</description>

      <title>AudioScene: Integrating Object-Event Audio into 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advances in audio analysis underscore its vast potential for humancomputer interaction, environmental monitoring, and public safety; yet, existing audioonly datasets often lack spatial context. To address this gap, we present two novel audiospatial scene datasets, AudioScanNet and AudioRoboTHOR, designed to explore audioconditioned tasks within 3D environments. By integrating audio clips with spatially aligned 3D scenes, our datasets enable research on how audio signals interact with spatial context. To associate audio events with corresponding spatial information, we leverage the common sense reasoning ability of large language models and supplement them with rigorous human verification, This approach offers greater scalability compared to purely manual annotation while maintaining high standards of accuracy, completeness, and diversity, quantified through inter annotator agreement and performance on two benchmark tasks audio based 3D visual grounding and audio based robotic zeroshot navigation. The results highlight the limitations of current audiocentric methods and underscore the practical challenges and significance of our datasets in advancing audio guided spatial learning.</description>

      <title>LocaGen: Sub-Sample Time-Delay Learning for Beam Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of LocaGen is to improve the localization performance of audio signals in the 2-D beam localization problem. LocaGen reduces sampling quantization errors through machine learning models trained on realistic synthetic data generated by a simulation. The system increases the accuracy of both direction-of-arrival (DOA) and precise location estimation of an audio beam from an array of three microphones. We demonstrate LocaGen's efficacy on a low-powered embedded system with an increased localization accuracy with a minimal increase in real-time resource usage. LocaGen was demonstrated to reduce DOA error by approximately 67% even with a microphone array of only 10 kHz in audio processing.</description>

      <title>Beyond Unified Models: A Service-Oriented Approach to Low Latency, Context Aware Phonemization for Real Time TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight, real-time text-to-speech systems are crucial for accessibility. However, the most efficient TTS models often rely on lightweight phonemizers that struggle with context-dependent challenges. In contrast, more advanced phonemizers with a deeper linguistic understanding typically incur high computational costs, which prevents real-time performance.
  This paper examines the trade-off between phonemization quality and inference speed in G2P-aided TTS systems, introducing a practical framework to bridge this gap. We propose lightweight strategies for context-aware phonemization and a service-oriented TTS architecture that executes these modules as independent services. This design decouples heavy context-aware components from the core TTS engine, effectively breaking the latency barrier and enabling real-time use of high-quality phonemization models. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system improves pronunciation soundness and linguistic accuracy while maintaining real-time responsiveness, making it well-suited for offline and end-device TTS applications.</description>

      <title>Direction-of-Arrival and Noise Covariance Matrix joint estimation for beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a joint estimation method for the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) and the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) tailored for beamforming applications. Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the NAO: Extending Capabilities of Legacy Robots for Long-Term Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legacy (unsupported) robotic platforms often lose research utility when manufacturer support ends, preventing integration of modern sensing, speech, and interaction capabilities. We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot featuring upgraded beamforming microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud-based and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot user study validating conversational performance, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and elicited stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. The added visual and thermal sensing modalities established a foundation for future perception-driven interaction. Beyond this implementation, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.</description>
