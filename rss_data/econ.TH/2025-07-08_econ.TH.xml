      <title>An efficiency ordering of k-price auctions under complete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $k$-price auctions in a complete information environment and characterize all pure-strategy Nash equilibrium outcomes. In a setting with $n$ agents having ordered valuations, we show that any agent, except those with the lowest $k-2$ valuations, can win in equilibrium. As a consequence, worst-case welfare increases monotonically as we go from $k=2$ (second-price auction) to $k=n$ (lowest-price auction), with the first-price auction achieving the highest worst-case welfare.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scalars: Zonotope-Valued Utility for Representation of Multidimensional Incomplete Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I propose a new framework for representing multidimensional incomplete preferences through zonotope-valued utilities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional scalar and vector-based models in decision theory. Traditional approaches assign single numerical values to alternatives, failing to capture the complexity of preferences where alternatives remainmain incomparable due to conflicting criteria across multiple dimensions. Our method maps each alternative to a zonotope, a convex geometric object in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) formed by Minkowski sums of intervals, which encapsulates the multidimensional structure of preferences with mathematical rigor. The set-valued nature of these payoffs stems from multiple sources, including non-probabilistic uncertainty, such as imprecise utility evaluation due to incomplete information about criteria weights, and probabilistic uncertainty arising from stochastic decision environments. By decomposing preference relations into interval orders and utilizing an extended set difference operator, we establish a rigorous axiomatization that defines preference as one alternative's zonotope differing from another's within the non-negative orthant of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). This framework generalizes existing representations and provides a visually intuitive and theoretically robust tool for modeling trade-offs among each dimension, while preferences are incomparable.</description>

      <title>A Directed Lazy Random Walk Model to Three-Way Dynamic Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel extension of dynamic matching theory by analyzing a three-way matching problem involving agents from three distinct populations, each with two possible types. Unlike traditional static or two-way dynamic models, our setting captures more complex team-formation environments where one agent from each of the three populations must be matched to form a valid team. We consider two preference structures: assortative or homophilic, where agents prefer to be matched with others of the same type, and dis-assortative or heterophilic, where diversity within the team is valued. Agents arrive sequentially and face a trade-off between matching immediately or waiting for a higher quality match in the future albeit with a waiting cost. We construct and analyze the corresponding transition probability matrices for each preference regime and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of stationary distributions. Our results show that stable and efficient outcomes can arise in dynamic, multi-agent matching environments, offering a deeper understanding of how complex matching processes evolve over time and how they can be effectively managed.</description>

      <title>Minimal balanced collections and their applications to core stability and other topics of game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal balanced collections are a generalization of partitions of a finite set of n elements and have important applications in cooperative game theory and discrete mathematics. However, their number is not known beyond n = 4. In this paper we investigate the problem of generating minimal balanced collections and implement the Peleg algorithm, permitting to generate all minimal balanced collections till n = 7. Secondly, we provide practical algorithms to check many properties of coalitions and games, based on minimal balanced collections, in a way which is faster than linear programming-based methods. In particular, we construct an algorithm to check if the core of a cooperative game is a stable set in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern. The algorithm implements a theorem according to which the core is a stable set if and only if a certain nested balancedness condition is valid. The second level of this condition requires generalizing the notion of balanced collection to balanced sets.</description>

      <title>Information Design in Smooth Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10883v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study information design in games where players choose from a continuum of actions and have continuously differentiable payoffs. We show that an information structure is optimal when the equilibrium it induces can also be implemented in a principal-agent contracting problem. Building on this result, we characterize optimal information structures in symmetric linear-quadratic games. With common values, targeted disclosure is robustly optimal across all priors. With interdependent and normally distributed values, linear disclosure is uniquely optimal. We illustrate our findings with applications in venture capital, Bayesian polarization, and price competition.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent contract design with a budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent contract design problem with moral hazard. In our model, each agent exerts costly effort towards an individual task at which it may either succeed or fail, and the principal, who wishes to encourage effort, has an exclusive-use budget that it can use to reward the agents. A motivating application is crowdsourcing for innovation, where a fixed budget is provided to a crowdsourcing platform to use for rewarding participants based on their submissions. Our main contribution is to introduce a novel class of contracts, which we call Luce contracts, and show that there is always a Luce contract that is optimal. A (generic) Luce contract assigns weights to the agents and distributes the entire budget among the successful agents in proportion to their weights. Furthermore, we characterize effort profiles that can be implemented by Luce contracts and show that Luce contracts offer a way to mitigate the uncertainty in total payments compared to alternative contracts-such as piece-rate or bonus-pool contracts-suggesting their desirability even in environments without budget constraints.</description>

      <title>Strategic communication of narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the communication of narratives as a cheap-talk game under model uncertainty. The sender has private information about the true data generating process of publicly observable data. The receiver is uncertain about how to interpret the data, but aware of the sender's incentives to strategically provide interpretations ("narratives"). We introduce a general class of ambiguity rules resolving the receiver's ignorance of the true data generating process, including maximum likelihood and max-min expected utility. The set of equilibria is characterized by a positive integer $N$: we derive an algorithm which yields an equilibrium that induces $n$ different actions for each $1\leq n \leq N$. We further show that the persuasive power of the sender is weaker in the sense of state-wise dominance than with a na\"ive receiver being unaware of the sender's incentives.</description>

      <title>Nested Removal of Strictly Dominated Strategies in Infinite Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two procedures for the iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies. In the nested procedure, a strategy of a player is removed only if it is dominated by an unremoved strategy. The universal procedure is more comprehensive for it allows the removal of strategies that are dominated by previously removed ones. Outside the class of finite games, the two procedures may lead to different outcomes in that the universal one is always order independent while the other is not. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two procedures. The conditions we give are based on completely bounded subsets of strategy profiles, which are variations of the bounded mechanisms from the literature on full implementation. The two elimination procedures are also shown to be equivalent in quasisupermodular games as well as in games with compact strategy spaces and upper semicontinuous payoff functions. We show by example that order independence of the nested procedure is not sufficient for its being equivalent to the universal one.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Monopoly Pricing With Multiple Varieties: Trading Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.07146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies dynamic monopoly pricing for a broad class of settings that allow for multiple durable, multiple rental, or a mix of varieties. We show that the driving force behind pricing dynamics is the existence of trading-up opportunities. If there are no trading-up opportunities in the static monopoly outcome, then pricing dynamics do not emerge in equilibrium. With trading-up opportunities, pricing dynamics arise until these opportunities are exhausted or the game ends. We characterize the lower bound for the emerging prices and profit and study the conditions under which pricing dynamics end in finite time.</description>
