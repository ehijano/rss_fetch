      <title>Subcellular proteome niche discovery using semi-supervised functional clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular compartmentalization of proteins underpins their function and the metabolic processes they sustain. Various mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods (subcellular spatial proteomics) now allow high throughput subcellular protein localization. Yet, the curation, analysis and interpretation of these data remain challenging, particularly in non-model organisms where establishing reliable marker proteins is difficult, and in contexts where experimental replication and subcellular fractionation are constrained. Here, we develop FSPmix, a semi-supervised functional clustering method implemented as an open-source R package, which leverages partial annotations from a subset of marker proteins to predict protein subcellular localization from subcellular spatial proteomics data. This method explicitly assumes that protein signatures vary smoothly across subcellular fractions, enabling more robust inference under low signal-to-noise data regimes. We applied FSPmix to a subcellular proteomics dataset from a marine diatom, allowing us to assign probabilistic localizations to proteins and uncover potentially new protein functions. Altogether, this work lays the foundation for more robust statistical analysis and interpretation of subcellular proteomics datasets, particularly in understudied organisms.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Simulating Metabolic Pathway Dynamics from Time-Series Multiomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of human healthspan and bioengineering relies heavily on predicting the behavior of complex biological systems. While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets. Furthermore, the NODE models demonstrated a 1000x acceleration in inference time, establishing them as a scalable, high-fidelity tool for the next generation of metabolic engineering and biological discovery.</description>
