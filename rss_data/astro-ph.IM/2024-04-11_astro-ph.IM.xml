      <title>Prospects of the multi-channel photometric survey telescope in the cosmological application of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a real-time, three-color photometric system designed to capture the color evolution of stars and transients accurately. This telescope system can be crucial in cosmological distance measurements of low-redshift (low-$z$, $z$ $\lesssim 0.1$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). To optimize the capabilities of this instrument, we perform a comprehensive simulation study before its official operation is scheduled to start. By considering the impact of atmospheric extinction, weather conditions, and the lunar phase at the observing site involving the instrumental features, we simulate the light curves of SNe Ia obtained by the Mephisto. The best strategy in the case of SN Ia cosmology is to take the image at an exposure time of 130 s with a cadence of 3 days. In this condition, Mephisto can obtain hundreds of high-quality SNe Ia to achieve a distance measurement better than $4.5\%$. Given the on-time spectral classification and monitoring of the Lijiang 2.4 m Telescope at the same observatory, Mephisto, in the whole operation, can significantly enrich the well-calibrated sample of supernovae at low-$z$ and improve the calibration accuracy of high-$z$ SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>BeyonCE -- Light Curve Modelling Beyond Circular Eclipsers I. Shallot Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Time-series photometry has given astronomers the tools to study time-dependent astrophysical phenomena, from stellar activity to fast radio bursts and exoplanet transits. Transit events in particular are focused primarily on planetary transits, and eclipsing binaries with eclipse geometries that are parameterised with a few variables, while more complex light curves caused by substructure within the transiting object require customized analysis code.
  Aims. We present Beyond Circular Eclipsers (BeyonCE), which reduces the parameter space encompassed by the transit of circum-secondary disc (CSD) systems with azimuthally symmetric non-uniform optical depth profiles. By rejecting disc geometries that cannot reproduce the measured gradients within their light curves, we can constrain the size and orientation of discs with complex sub-structure.
  Methods. We map out all the possible geometries of a disc, calculate the gradients for rings crossing the star, then reject those configurations where the measured gradient of the light curve is greater than the theoretical gradient from the given disc orientation.
  Results. We present the fitting code BeyonCE and demonstrate its effectiveness in considerably reducing the parameter space of discs that contain azimuthally symmetric structure by analyzing the light curves seen towards J1407 and PDS 110 which are attributed to CSD transits.</description>

      <title>Research on fine co-focus adjustment method for segmented solar telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For segmented telescopes, achieving fine co-focus adjustment is essential for realizing co-phase adjustment and maintenance, which involves adjusting the millimeter-scale piston between segments to fall within the capture range of the co-phase detection system. CGST proposes using a SHWFS for piston detection during the co-focus adjustment stage. However, the residual piston after adjustment exceeds the capture range of the broadband PSF phasing algorithm$(\pm 30 \mu m) $, and the multi-wavelength PSF algorithm requires even higher precision in co-focus adjustment. To improve the co-focus adjustment accuracy of CGST, a fine co-focus adjustment based on cross-calibration is proposed. This method utilizes a high-precision detector to calibrate and fit the measurements from the SHWFS, thereby reducing the impact of atmospheric turbulence and systematic errors on piston measurement accuracy during co-focus adjustment. Simulation results using CGST demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances adjustment accuracy compared to the SHWFS detection method. Additionally, the residual piston after fine co-focus adjustment using this method falls within the capture range of the multi-wavelength PSF algorithm. To verify the feasibility of this method, experiments were conducted on an 800mm ring segmented mirror system, successfully achieving fine co-focus adjustment where the remaining piston of all segments fell within $\pm 15 \mu m$.</description>

      <title>Closing the stellar labels gap: Stellar label independent evidence for [$\alpha$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven models for stellar spectra which depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the "stellar labels gap". To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP (XP) spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder; a $\textit{scatter}$ VAE, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and intrinsic scatter without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [$\alpha$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [$\alpha$/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the $\alpha$-bimodality $\textit{without relying on stellar label correlations}$, for stars with $T_{\rm eff} &lt;$ 5000 K. We publicly release our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any/all XP spectra because our model performance scales with training object density, not training label density.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present an interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of statistical power offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>M-dwarf flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility data and what we can learn from them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting M-dwarf flares using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility data releases (ZTF DRs). We employ two different approaches: the traditional method of parametric fit search and a machine learning algorithm originally developed for anomaly detection. We analyzed over 35 million ZTF light curves and visually scrutinized 1168 candidates suggested by the algorithms to filter out artifacts, occultations of a star by an asteroid, and known variable objects of other types. Our final sample comprises 134 flares with amplitude ranging from 0.2 to 4.6 magnitudes, including repeated flares and complex flares with multiple components. Using Pan-STARRS DR2 colors, we also assigned a corresponding spectral subclass to each object in the sample. For 13 flares with well-sampled light curves, we estimated the bolometric energy. Our results show that the ZTF's cadence strategy is suitable for identifying M-dwarf flares and other fast transients, allowing for the extraction of significant astrophysical information from their light curves.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Fast Generation of Air Shower Images for Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the analysis of data taken by Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), a large number of air shower simulations are needed to derive the instrument response. The simulations are very complex, involving computational and memory-intensive calculations, and are usually performed repeatedly for different observation intervals to take into account the varying optical sensitivity of the instrument. The use of generative models based on deep neural networks offers the prospect for memory-efficient storing of huge simulation libraries and cost-effective generation of a large number of simulations in an extremely short time. In this work, we use Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks to generate photon showers for an IACT equipped with the FlashCam design, which has more than $1{,}500$ pixels. Using simulations of the H.E.S.S. experiment, we demonstrate the successful generation of high-quality IACT images. The analysis includes a comprehensive study of the generated image quality based on low-level observables and the well-known Hillas parameters that describe the shower shape. We demonstrate for the first time that the generated images have high fidelity with respect to low-level observables, the Hillas parameters, their physical properties, as well as their correlations. The found increase in generation speed in the order of $10^5$ yields promising prospects for fast and memory-efficient simulations of air showers for IACTs.</description>

      <title>Characterization and performance of an upgraded front-end-board for NectarCAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the updated version of the Front-End Board (FEB) for the NectarCAM camera, developed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The FEB is a critical component responsible for reading and converting signals from the camera's photo-multiplier tubes into digital data and generating module-level trigger signals. This study provides an overview of the design and performance of the new FEB version, including the use of an improved NECTAr3 chip with advanced features. The NECTAr3 chip contains a switched capacitor array for sampling signals at 1 GHz and a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for digitization upon receiving a trigger signal. The integration of the new NECTAr3 chip results in a significant reduction of NectarCAM's deadtime by an order of magnitude compared to the previous version. The paper also presents the results of laboratory testing, including measurements of timing performance, linearity, dynamic range, and deadtime, to characterize the new FEB's performance.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Atmospheric Dispersion Correction of the Gemini Planet Imager: residual dispersion above design requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) corrects the chromatic dispersion caused by differential atmospheric refraction (DAR), making it an important optic for exoplanet observation. Despite requiring less than 5 mas of residual DAR to avoid potentially affecting the coronagraph, the GPI ADC averages $\sim7$ and $\sim11$ mas of residual DAR in $H$ and $J$ band respectively. We analyzed GPI data in those bands to find explanations for the underperformance. We found the model GPI uses to predict DAR underestimates humidity's impact on incident DAR, causing on average a 0.54 mas increase in $H$ band residual DAR. Additionally, the GPI ADC consistently undercorrects in $H$ band by about 7 mas, causing almost all the $H$ band residual DAR. $J$ band does not have such an offset. Perpendicular dispersion induced by the GPI ADC, potentially from a misalignment in the prisms' relative orientation, causes 86% of the residual DAR in $J$ band. Correcting these issues could reduce residual DAR, thereby improving exoplanet detection. We also made a new approximation for the index of refraction of air from 0.7 microns to 1.36 microns that more accurately accounts for the effects of humidity.</description>

      <title>Tianyu: search for the second solar system and explore the dynamic universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V &lt; 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS): I. Analysis of 0.9 Million Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly one million light curves from the TESS Year 1 southern hemisphere extracted from Full Frame Images with the DIAmante pipeline are processed through the AutoRegressive Planet Search statistical procedure. ARIMA models remove trends and lingering autocorrelated noise, the Transit Comb Filter identifies the strongest periodic signal in the light curve, and a Random Forest machine learning classifier is trained and applied to identify the best potential candidates. Classifier training sets include injections of both planetary transit signals and contaminating eclipsing binaries. The optimized classifier has a True Positive Rate of 92.8% and a False Positive Rate of 0.37% from the labeled training set. The result of this DIAmante TESS autoregressive planet search (DTARPS) analysis is a list of 7,377 potential exoplanet candidates. The classifier has a False Positive Rate of 0.3%, a 64% recall rate for previously confirmed exoplanets, and a 78% negative recall rate for known False Positives. The completeness map of the injected planetary signals shows high recall rates for planets with 8 - 30 R(Earth) radii and periods 0.6-13 days and poor completeness for planets with radii &lt; 2 R(Earth) or periods &lt; 1 day. The list has many False Alarms and False Positives that need to be culled with multifaceted vetting operations (Paper II).</description>

      <title>DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS): II. Hundreds of New TESS Candidate Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS) project seeks to identify photometric transiting planets from 976,814 southern hemisphere stars observed in Year 1 of the TESS mission. This paper follows the methodology developed by Melton et al. (Paper I) using light curves extracted and pre-processed by the DIAmante project (Montalto et al. 2020). Paper I emerged with a list of 7,377 light curves with statistical properties characteristic of transiting planets but dominated by False Alarms and False Positives. Here a multistage vetting procedure is applied including: centroid motion and crowding metrics, False Alarm and False Positive reduction, photometric binary elimination, and ephemeris match removal. The vetting produces a catalog of 462 DTARPS Candidates across the southern ecliptic hemisphere and 310 objects in a spatially incomplete Galactic Plane list. Fifty-eight percent were not previously identified as transiting systems. Candidates are flagged for possible blending from nearby stars based on Zwicky Transient Facility data and for possible radial velocity variations based on Gaia satellite data. Orbital periods and planetary radii are refined using astrophysical modeling; the resulting parameters closely match published values for Confirmed Planets. Their properties are discussed in Paper III.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surge of deep-space probes makes it unsustainable to navigate them with standard radiometric tracking. Self-driving interplanetary satellites represent a solution to this problem. In this work, a full vision-based navigation algorithm is built by combining an orbit determination method with an image processing pipeline suitable for interplanetary transfers of autonomous platforms. To increase the computational efficiency of the algorithm, a non-dimensional extended Kalman filter is selected as state estimator, fed by the positions of the planets extracted from deep-space images. An enhancement of the estimation accuracy is performed by applying an optimal strategy to select the best pair of planets to track. Moreover, a novel analytical measurement model for deep-space navigation is developed providing a first-order approximation of the light-aberration and light-time effects. Algorithm performance is tested on a high-fidelity, Earth--Mars interplanetary transfer, showing the algorithm applicability for deep-space navigation.</description>
