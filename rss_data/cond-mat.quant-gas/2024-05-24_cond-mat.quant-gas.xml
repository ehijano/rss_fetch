      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, in a narrow region, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mixtures of Ultracold Atomic Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of different kinds of ultracold gases constitutes a novel powerful experimental framework for the investigation of a variety of physical problems. We illustrate the differences among possible quantum mixtures, be they homonuclear spin mixtures or heteronuclear ones, and show how they can be exploited to investigate a plethora of topics from the few-body to the many-body regimes. In particular, we discuss quantum mixtures of ultracold gases under three different perspectives: systems made of a few atoms of different kinds, single impurities immersed in a host quantum gas, and quantum mixtures of two interacting gases. Given the broad spectrum of possible topics and experimental regimes, in this review we restrict the discussion on single harmonic or flat traps, predominantly in a three-dimensional configuration. A selection of results on recent experiments and possible interesting future directions are given.</description>

      <title>Exotic d-wave Bose Metal in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau Fermi liquid theory, a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, encounters limitations in explaining certain phenomena, like the peculiar behavior of strange metals in high-temperature superconductors. Non-Fermi liquids, like Bose metals with uncondensed bosonic ground state, offer potential explanations, yet constructing an elusive Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a formidable challenge. Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal in a highly anisotropic regime (a &lt; 0.30) with wide range of filling, most notably at a filling fraction of n~0.8. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of dxy correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>

      <title>Electronic state back action on mechanical motion in a quantum point contact coupled to a nanomechanical resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a quantum point contact, the back action of the electronic state on mechanical motion is studied. The quantum point contact conductance changing with subband index and the eigenfrequency of the resonator are found to correlate. A model is constructed explaining the frequency deviations by the alternating ability of the quantum point contact to screen the piezoelectric charge induced by mechanical oscillations. The observed effects can be used to develop electromechanical methods for studying the density of states in quasi-one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Generalized Landau Levels and Implication for non-Abelian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a fundamental concept to characterize the local properties of quantum states. It is recently demonstrated that saturating certain quantum geometric bounds allows a topological Chern band to share many essential features with the lowest Landau level, facilitating fractionalized phases in moir\'e flat bands. In this work, we systematically extend the consequence and universality of saturated geometric bounds to arbitrary Landau levels by introducing a set of single-particle states, which we term as ``generalized Landau levels''. These generalized Landau levels exhibit exactly quantized values of integrated trace of quantum metric determined by their corresponding Landau level indices, regardless of the nonuniformity of their quantum geometric quantities. We derive all geometric quantities for individual and multiple generalized Landau levels, discuss their relations, and understand them in light of the theory of holomorphic curves and moving frames. We further propose a model by superposing few generalized Landau levels which is supposed to capture a large portion of the single-particle Hilbert space of a generic Chern band analogous to the first Landau level. Using this model, we employ exact diagonalization to identify a single-particle geometric criterion for permitting the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase, which is potentially useful for future engineering of moir\'e materials and beyond. We use a double twisted bilayer graphene model with only adjacent layer hopping term to show the existence of first generalized Landau level type narrow band and zero-field Moore-Read state at the second magic angle which serves as a promising starting point for more detailed future studies. We expect that generalized Landau levels will serve as a systematic tool for analyzing topological Chern bands and fractionalized phases therein.</description>

      <title>Borromean states in a one-dimensional three-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of Borromean bound states in a one-dimensional quantum three-body system composed of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle. It is assumed that there is no interaction between the two bosons, while the mass-imbalanced two-body subsystems can be tuned to be either bound or unbound. Within the framework of the Faddeev equations, the three-body spectrum and the corresponding wave functions are computed numerically. In addition, we identify the parameter-space region for the two-body interaction, where the Borromean states occur, evaluate their geometric properties, and investigate their dependence on the mass ratio.</description>

Abstract: An increasingly large variety of molecular species are being cooled down to low energies in recent years, and innovative ideas and powerful techniques continue to emerge to gain ever more precise control of molecular motion. In this brief review we focus our discussions on two widely employed cooling techniques that have brought molecular gases into the quantum regime: association of ultracold atomic gases into quantum gases of molecules and direct laser cooling of molecules. These advances have brought into reality our capability to prepare and manipulate both internal and external states of molecules quantum mechanically, opening the field of cold molecules to a wide range of scientific explorations.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental progress in atomic, molecular, and optical platforms in the last decade has stimulated strong and broad interest in the quantum coherent dynamics of many long-range interacting particles. The prominent collective character of these systems enables novel non-equilibrium phenomena with no counterpart in conventional quantum systems with local interactions. Much of the theory work in this area either focussed on the impact of variable-range interaction tails on the physics of local interactions or relied on mean-field-like descriptions based on the opposite limit of all-to-all infinite-range interactions. In this Report, we present a systematic and organic review of recent advances in the field. Working with prototypical interacting quantum spin lattices without disorder, our presentation hinges upon a versatile theoretical formalism that interpolates between the few-body mean-field physics and the many-body physics of quasi-local interactions. Such a formalism allows us to connect these two regimes, providing both a formal quantitative tool and basic physical intuition. We leverage this unifying framework to review several findings of the last decade, including the peculiar non-ballistic spreading of quantum correlations, counter-intuitive slowdown of entanglement dynamics, suppression of thermalization and equilibration, anomalous scaling of defects upon traversing criticality, dynamical phase transitions, and genuinely non-equilibrium phases stabilized by periodic driving. The style of this Report is on the pedagogical side, which makes it accessible to readers without previous experience in the subject matter.</description>

      <title>Bound impurities in a one-dimensional Bose lattice gas: low-energy properties and quench-induced dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two mobile bosonic impurities immersed in a one-dimensional optical lattice and interacting with a bosonic bath. We employ the exact diagonalization method for small periodic lattices to study stationary properties and dynamics. We consider the branch of repulsive interactions that induce the formation of bound impurities, akin to the bipolaron problem. A comprehensive study of ground-state and low-energy properties is presented, including an examination of the interaction strengths which induce the formation of a bound dimer of impurities. We also study the dynamics induced after an interaction quench to examine the stability of the bound dimers. We reveal that after large interaction quenches from strong to weak interactions the system can show large oscillations over time with revivals of the dimer states. We find that the oscillations are driven by selected eigenstates with phase-separated configurations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

Abstract: Mobility edge (ME), representing the critical energy that distinguishes between extended and localized states, is a key concept in understanding the transition between extended (metallic) and localized (insulating) states in disordered and quasiperiodic systems. Here we explore the impact of dissipation on a quasiperiodic system featuring MEs by calculating steady-state density matrix and analyzing quench dynamics with sudden introduction of dissipation, and demonstrate that dissipation can lead the system into specific states predominantly characterized by either extended or localized states, irrespective of the initial state. Our results establish the use of dissipation as a new avenue for inducing transitions between extended and localized states, and for manipulating dynamic behaviors of particles.</description>

      <title>Robust effective ground state in a nonintegrable Floquet quantum circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An external periodic (Floquet) drive is believed to bring any initial state to the featureless infinite temperature state in generic nonintegrable isolated quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, irrespective of the driving frequency $\Omega$. However, numerical or analytical evidence either proving or disproving this hypothesis is very limited and the issue has remained unsettled. Here, we study the initial state dependence of Floquet heating in a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain of length up to $L=30$ with an efficient quantum circuit simulator, showing a possible counterexample: The ground state of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian is exceptionally robust against heating, and could stay at finite energy density even after infinitely many Floquet cycles, if the driving period is shorter than a threshold value. This sharp energy localization transition/crossover does not happen for generic excited states. The exceptional robustness of the ground state is interpreted by (i) its isolation in the energy spectrum and (ii) the fact that those states with $L$-independent $\hbar\Omega$ energy above the ground state energy of any generic local Hamiltonian, like the approximate Floquet Hamiltonian, are atypical and viewed as a collection of noninteracting quasipartiles. Our finding paves the way for engineering Floquet protocols with finite driving periods realizing long-lived, or possibly even perpetual, Floquet phases by initial state design.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model model.</description>

      <title>Swapping Floquet time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Floquet period-doubling time-crystal model based on a disordered interacting long-range spin chain where the periodic swapping of nearby spin couples is applied. This protocol can be applied to systems with any local spin magnitude $s$ {and in principle also to systems with nonspin (fermionic or bosonic) local Hilbert space}. We explicitly consider the cases $s = 1/2$ and $s = 1$, using analytical and numerical methods to show that the time-crystal behavior appears in a range of parameters. In particular, we study the persistence of period-doubling oscillations in time, the time-crystal properties of the Floquet spectrum (quasienergy $\pi$-spectral pairing and long-range correlations of the Floquet states), and introduce a quantity (the local imbalance) to assess what initial states give rise to a period-doubling dynamics. We also consider the average level spacing ratio and find that the interval of parameters where the system does not thermalize and persistent period-doubling is possible corresponds to the one where the Floquet spectrum shows time-crystal properties.</description>
