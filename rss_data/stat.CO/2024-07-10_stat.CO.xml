      <title>Sequential Kalman Monte Carlo for gradient-free inference in Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) has been proposed as an efficient method for solving inverse problems with expensive forward models. However, the method is based on the assumption that we proceed through a sequence of Gaussian measures in moving from the prior to the posterior, and that the forward model is linear. In this work, we introduce Sequential Kalman Monte Carlo (SKMC) samplers, where we exploit EKI and Flow Annealed Kalman Inversion (FAKI) within a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling scheme to perform efficient gradient-free inference in Bayesian inverse problems. FAKI employs normalizing flows (NF) to relax the Gaussian ansatz of the target measures in EKI. NFs are able to learn invertible maps between a Gaussian latent space and the original data space, allowing us to perform EKI updates in the Gaussianized NF latent space. However, FAKI alone is not able to correct for the model linearity assumptions in EKI. Errors in the particle distribution as we move through the sequence of target measures can therefore compound to give incorrect posterior moment estimates. In this work we consider the use of EKI and FAKI to initialize the particle distribution for each target in an adaptive SMC annealing scheme, before performing t-preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (tpCN) updates to distribute particles according to the target. We demonstrate the performance of these SKMC samplers on three challenging numerical benchmarks, showing significant improvements in the rate of convergence compared to standard SMC with importance weighted resampling at each temperature level. Code implementing the SKMC samplers is available at https://github.com/RichardGrumitt/KalmanMC.</description>

      <title>Solidarity of Gibbs Samplers: the spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gibbs samplers are preeminent Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms used in computational physics and statistical computing. Yet, their most fundamental properties, such as relations between convergence characteristics of their various versions, are not well understood.
  In this paper we prove the solidarity of their spectral gaps: if any of the random scan or $d!$ deterministic scans has a~spectral gap then all of them have. Our methods rely on geometric interpretation of the Gibbs samplers as alternating projection algorithms and analysis of the rate of convergence in the von Neumann--Halperin method of cyclic alternating projections.
  In addition, we provide a quantitative result: if the spectral gap of the random scan Gibbs sampler scales polynomially with dimension, so does the spectral gap of any of the deterministic scans.</description>

      <title>JOINTVIP: Prioritizing variables in observational study design with joint variable importance plot in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10367v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Credible causal effect estimation requires treated subjects and controls to be otherwise similar. In observational settings, such as analysis of electronic health records, this is not guaranteed. Investigators must balance background variables so they are similar in treated and control groups. Common approaches include matching (grouping individuals into small homogeneous sets) or weighting (upweighting or downweighting individuals) to create similar profiles. However, creating identical distributions may be impossible if many variables are measured, and not all variables are of equal importance to the outcome. The joint variable importance plot (jointVIP) package to guides decisions about which variables to prioritize for adjustment by quantifying and visualizing each variable's relationship to both treatment and outcome.</description>

      <title>How Inverse Conditional Flows Can Serve as a Substitute for Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression, are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.</description>
