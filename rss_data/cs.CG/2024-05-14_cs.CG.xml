      <title>TPMS2STEP: error-controlled and C2 continuity-preserving translation of TPMS models to STEP files based on constrained-PIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) is emerging as an important way of designing microstructures. However, there has been limited use of commercial CAD/CAM/CAE software packages for TPMS design and manufacturing. This is mainly because TPMS is consistently described in the functional representation (F-rep) format, while modern CAD/CAM/CAE tools are built upon the boundary representation (B-rep) format. One possible solution to this gap is translating TPMS to STEP, which is the standard data exchange format of CAD/CAM/CAE. Following this direction, this paper proposes a new translation method with error-controlling and $C^2$ continuity-preserving features. It is based on an approximation error-driven TPMS sampling algorithm and a constrained-PIA algorithm. The sampling algorithm controls the deviation between the original and translated models. With it, an error bound of $2\epsilon$ on the deviation can be ensured if two conditions called $\epsilon$-density and $\epsilon$-approximation are satisfied. The constrained-PIA algorithm enforces $C^2$ continuity constraints during TPMS approximation, and meanwhile attaining high efficiency. A theoretical convergence proof of this algorithm is also given. The effectiveness of the translation method has been demonstrated by a series of examples and comparisons.</description>

      <title>Patrolling Grids with a Bit of Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of patrolling regular grid graphs of any dimension using a single mobile agent with minimal memory and limited sensing range. We show that it is impossible to patrol some grid graphs with $0$ bits of memory, regardless of sensing range, and give an exact characterization of those grid graphs that can be patrolled with $0$ bits of memory and sensing range $V$. On the other hand, we show that an algorithm exists using $1$ bit of memory and $V=1$ that patrols any $d$-dimensional grid graph. This result is surprising given that the agent must be able to move in $2d$ distinct directions to patrol, while $1$ bit of memory allows specifying only two directions per sensory input. Our $1$-bit patrolling algorithm handles this by carefully exploiting a small state-space to access all the needed directions while avoiding getting stuck. Overall, our results give concrete evidence that extremely little memory is needed for patrolling highly regular environments like grid graphs compared to arbitrary graphs. The techniques we use, such as partitioning the environment into sensing regions and exploiting distinct coordinates resulting from higher-dimensionality, may be applicable to analyzing the space complexity of patrolling in other types of regular environments as well.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Algorithm for Tubular Shape Reconstruction from Skeletal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of tubular shapes from skeletal representations. Our method processes all skeletal points as a whole, eliminating the need for splitting input structure into multiple segments. We represent the tubular shape as a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) in a voxel hashing manner, in which the signed distance between a voxel center and the object is computed through a simple geometric algorithm. Our method does not involve any surface sampling scheme or solving large matrix equations, and therefore is a faster and more elegant solution for tubular shape reconstruction compared to other approaches. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/Dragon.</description>
