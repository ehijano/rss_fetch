      <title>STAR-RIS-assisted Collaborative Beamforming for Low-altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) based on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer high mobility, flexibility, and coverage for urban communications, they face severe signal attenuation in dense environments due to obstructions. To address this critical issue, we consider introducing collaborative beamforming (CB) of UAVs and omnidirectional reconfigurable beamforming (ORB) of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) to enhance the signal quality and directionality. On this basis, we formulate a joint rate and energy optimization problem (JREOP) to maximize the transmission rate of the overall system, while minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV swarm. Due to the non-convex and NP-hard nature of JREOP, we propose a heterogeneous multi-agent collaborative dynamic (HMCD) optimization framework, which has two core components. The first component is a simulated annealing (SA)-based STAR-RIS control method, which dynamically optimizes reflection and transmission coefficients to enhance signal propagation. The second component is an improved multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) control method, which incorporates a self-attention evaluation mechanism to capture interactions between UAVs and an adaptive velocity transition mechanism to enhance training stability. Simulation results demonstrate that HMCD outperforms various baselines in terms of convergence speed, average transmission rate, and energy consumption. Further analysis reveals that the average transmission rate of the overall system scales positively with both UAV count and STAR-RIS element numbers.</description>

      <title>When UAV Swarm Meets IRS: Collaborative Secure Communications in Low-altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) represent a promising architecture that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial nodes to provide enhanced coverage, reliability, and throughput for diverse applications. However, these networks face significant security vulnerabilities from both known and potential unknown eavesdroppers, which may threaten data confidentiality and system integrity. To solve this critical issue, we propose a novel secure communication framework for LAWNs where the selected UAVs within a swarm function as a virtual antenna array (VAA), complemented by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to create a robust defense against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously maximizes the secrecy rate while minimizing the maximum sidelobe level and total energy consumption, requiring joint optimization of UAV excitation current weights, flight trajectories, and IRS phase shifts. This problem presents significant difficulties due to the dynamic nature of the system and heterogeneous components. Thus, we first transform the problem into a heterogeneous Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we propose a heterogeneous multi-agent control approach (HMCA) that integrates a dedicated IRS control policy with a multi-agent soft actor-critic framework for UAV control, which enables coordinated operation across heterogeneous network elements. Simulation results show that the proposed HMCA achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches in terms of secrecy rate improvement, sidelobe suppression, and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we find that the collaborative and passive beamforming synergy between VAA and IRS creates robust security guarantees when the number of UAVs increases.</description>

      <title>HandPass: A Wi-Fi CSI Palm Authentication Approach for Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been extensively studied for sensing activities. However, its practical application in user authentication still needs to be explored. This study presents a novel approach to biometric authentication using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) data for palm recognition. The research delves into utilizing a Raspberry Pi encased in a custom-built box with antenna power reduced to 1dBm, which was used to capture CSI data from the right hands of 20 participants (10 men and 10 women). The dataset was normalized using MinMax scaling to ensure uniformity and accuracy. By focusing on biophysical aspects such as hand size, shape, angular spread between fingers, and finger phalanx lengths, among other characteristics, the study explores how these features affect electromagnetic signals, which are then reflected in Wi-Fi CSI, allowing for precise user identification. Five classification algorithms were evaluated, with the Random Forest classifier achieving an average F1-Score of 99.82\% using 10-fold cross-validation. Amplitude and Phase data were used, with each capture session recording approximately 1000 packets per second in five 5-second intervals for each User. This high accuracy highlights the potential of Wi-Fi CSI in developing robust and reliable user authentication systems based on palm biometric data.</description>

      <title>Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks for 6G Mobile Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the industrialization of 5G cellular communications, 6G has increasingly become a research hotspot in the academia. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) is a key supporting technology for 6G because of its advantages such as high-speed transmission and expanded coverage. This paper summarizes the motivation to develop the SAGIN-assisted 6G first and introduces the current situation of SAGIN. We then try to discuss the design concept of the SAGIN-assisted 6G, and list the problem and challenges. Moreover, we propose an architecture of the SAGIN-assisted 6G and identify a series of key technologies that are needed in different layers. Finally, in order for readers to better understand our hierarchical architecture, we use a case study discussing the congestion problem in the Integrated layer.</description>

      <title>NetBurst: Event-Centric Forecasting of Bursty, Intermittent Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting on widely used benchmark time series data (e.g., ETT, Electricity, Taxi, and Exchange Rate, etc.) has favored smooth, seasonal series, but network telemetry time series -- traffic measurements at service, IP, or subnet granularity -- are instead highly bursty and intermittent, with heavy-tailed bursts and highly variable inactive periods. These properties place the latter in the statistical regimes made famous and popularized more than 20 years ago by B.~Mandelbrot. Yet forecasting such time series with modern-day AI architectures remains underexplored. We introduce NetBurst, an event-centric framework that reformulates forecasting as predicting when bursts occur and how large they are, using quantile-based codebooks and dual autoregressors. Across large-scale sets of production network telemetry time series and compared to strong baselines, such as Chronos, NetBurst reduces Mean Average Scaled Error (MASE) by 13--605x on service-level time series while preserving burstiness and producing embeddings that cluster 5x more cleanly than Chronos. In effect, our work highlights the benefits that modern AI can reap from leveraging Mandelbrot's pioneering studies for forecasting in bursty, intermittent, and heavy-tailed regimes, where its operational value for high-stakes decision making is of paramount interest.</description>

      <title>Should BBR be the default TCP Congestion Control Protocol?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the feasibility of adopting the Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) protocol as the default congestion control mechanism for TCP. Our central question is whether BBR, particularly its latest iterations, BBRv2 and BBRv3, can outperform traditional TCP variants such as Reno and Cubic across diverse networking environments. We evaluated performance trade-offs in Internet, data center, Ethernet, wireless, and satellite networks, comparing BBR against protocols including DCTCP, DCQCN, TIMELY, HPCC, Swift, and congestion control schemes designed for low-Earth orbit satellite networks, using both experiments and previous studies. Our findings show that BBR consistently achieves high throughput across all environments, with especially strong performance and fairness in scenarios involving homogeneous BBR flows or high bandwidth Internet paths. Experiments with Google and other websites over a 100~Mbps home network further confirm BBR's superior performance and its ability to co-exist with Cubic flows. In another experiment on the Marist campus (1--10~Gbps network), we observed its latency characteristics compared to Cubic. Moreover, a controlled evaluation between protocols reveals that BBR achieves the highest throughput ($\approx 905$~Mbps) but introduces higher latency ($\approx 0.79$~ms) and jitter ($\approx 4.2$~ms). In contrast, Reno and Cubic deliver balanced performance with lower latency and moderate jitter. Vegas prioritizes minimal latency and jitter at the cost of reduced throughput. These results demonstrate the strength of BBR to handle bulk transfers and bandwidth-intensive applications. However, they also emphasize the significance of workload-driven protocol selection in latency-sensitive environments.</description>

      <title>A Control-Theoretic Perspective on BBR/CUBIC Congestion-Control Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the fairness properties of the BBR congestion-control algorithm (CCA), previous research has analyzed BBR behavior with a variety of models. However, previous model-based work suffers from a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability: While dynamic fluid models generate highly accurate predictions through simulation, the causes of their predictions cannot be easily understood. In contrast, steady-state models predict CCA behavior in a manner that is intuitively understandable, but often less accurate. This trade-off is especially consequential when analyzing the competition between BBR and traditional loss-based CCAs, as this competition often suffers from instability, i.e., sending-rate oscillation. Steady-state models cannot predict this instability at all, and fluid-model simulation cannot yield analytical results regarding preconditions and severity of the oscillation. To overcome this trade-off, we extend the recent dynamic fluid model of BBR by means of control theory. Based on this control-theoretic analysis, we derive quantitative conditions for BBR/CUBIC oscillation, identify network settings that are susceptible to instability, and find that these conditions are frequently satisfied by practical networks. Our analysis illuminates the fairness implications of BBR/CUBIC oscillation, namely by deriving and experimentally validating fairness bounds that reflect the extreme rate distributions during oscillation. In summary, our analysis shows that BBR/CUBIC oscillation is frequent and harms BBR fairness, but can be remedied by means of our control-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Exploring LR-FHSS Modulation for Enhanced IoT Connectivity: A Measurement Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive real-world measurement campaign comparing LR-FHSS and LoRa modulations within LoRaWAN networks in urban environments. Conducted in Halifax, Canada, the campaign used a LoRaWAN platform capable of operating both modulations in the FCC-regulated US915 band. Real-world measurements are crucial for capturing the effects of urban topology and signal propagation challenges, which are difficult to fully replicate in simulations. Results show that LR-FHSS can achieve up to a 20% improvement in Packet Reception Rate (PRR) over traditional LoRa in dense urban areas. Additionally, the study investigated path loss and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), finding that LR-FHSS achieved a minimum RSSI of -138 dBm compared to LoRa's -120 dBm. The findings demonstrate that the introduction of LR-FHSS enhances communication robustness and reliability under regulatory limitations and suggest promising applications in LoRaWAN networks.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Aware Air-to-Ground Channel Characterization for Low-Altitude UAVs Using MaMIMO Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based trajectory-aware characterization of low-altitude Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels in a suburban environment. A 64-element Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MaMIMO) array was used to capture channels for three trajectories of an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV), including two horizontal zig-zag flights at fixed altitudes and one vertical ascent, chosen to emulate AUE operations and to induce controlled azimuth and elevation sweeps for analyzing geometry-dependent propagation dynamics. We examine large-scale power variations and their correlation with geometric features, such as elevation, azimuth, and 3D distance, followed by an analysis of fading behavior through distribution fitting and Rician K-factor estimation. Furthermore, temporal non-stationarity is quantified using the Correlation Matrix Distance (CMD), and angular stationarity spans are utilized to demonstrate how channel characteristics change with the movement of the UAV. We also analyze Spectral Efficiency (SE) in relation to K-factor and Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread, highlighting their combined influence on link performance. The results show that the elevation angle is the strongest predictor of the received power, with a correlation of more than 0.77 for each trajectory, while the Nakagami model best fits the small-scale fading. The K-factor increases from approximately 5 dB at low altitudes to over 15 dB at higher elevations, indicating stronger LoS dominance. Non-stationarity patterns are highly trajectory- and geometry-dependent, with azimuth most affected in horizontal flights and elevation during vertical flight. These findings offer valuable insights for modeling and improving UAV communication channels in 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs).</description>

      <title>How to build a sovereign network? - A proposal to measure network sovereignty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network sovereignty is a network operator's ability to reduce the dependency on component manufacturers to minimize the impact of manufacturer failures. Network operators now face new design challenges to increase network sovereignty and avoid vendor lock-in problems because a high dependency on a manufacturer corresponds to low survivability if that manufacturer is unavailable. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a novel metric to measure network sovereignty, the Cut Set Coloring (CSC) score. Based on the CSC core metric CSC-ILP, our Integer Linear Program formulation is presented to maximize network sovereignty. We compare CSC-ILP's performance with state of the art manufacturer assignment strategies.</description>

      <title>PASS-Enhanced MEC: Joint Optimization of Task Offloading and Uplink PASS Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pinching-antenna system (PASS)-enhanced mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture is investigated to improve the task offloading efficiency and latency performance in dynamic wireless environments. By leveraging dielectric waveguides and flexibly adjustable pinching antennas, PASS establishes short-distance line-of-sight (LoS) links while effectively mitigating the significant path loss and potential signal blockage, making it a promising solution for high-frequency MEC systems. We formulate a network latency minimization problem to joint optimize uplink PASS beamforming and task offloading. The resulting problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solved via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. To address the instability introduced by the $\max$ operator in the objective function, we propose a load balancing-aware proximal policy optimization (LBPPO) algorithm. LBPPO incorporates both node-level and waveguide-level load balancing information into the policy design, maintaining computational and transmission delay equilibrium, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASS-enhanced MEC with adaptive uplink PASS beamforming exhibit stronger convergence capability than fixed-PA baselines and conventional MIMO-assisted MEC, especially in scenarios with a large number of UEs or high transmit power.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks: A Peer-to-Peer ACIDE Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In mobile wireless networks, livestreaming in high user density areas presents two typical challenges: the wireless bandwidth is depleted and the number of users is limited. In this study, a media distribution model utilizing peer to peer communications, Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment, is proposed for bandwidth efficient livestreaming. The basic idea is to group users with identical livestream interest in a cluster of n peers. Instead of sending n copies of a livestream package, only one copy is sent to the cluster. A package is divided into n blocks. Each user receives one block from the base station and the remaining n-1 blocks from the other peers. Two optimization problems are addressed. The first problem is minimizing the bandwidth needed to guarantee a continuous live media play on all peers. A solution is proposed to find the optimal block sizes such that the wireless bandwidth is minimized. The second problem is maximizing the number of peers admitted to a cluster, given a fixed wireless bandwidth. This problem is NP-complete and a greedy strategy is proposed to calculate a feasible solution for peer selection. The proposed model improves the bandwidth efficiency and allows more users to be served.</description>

      <title>Dynamic D2D-Assisted Federated Learning over O-RAN: Performance Analysis, MAC Scheduler, and Asymmetric User Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing studies on federated learning (FL) are mostly focused on system orchestration for static snapshots of the network and making static control decisions (e.g., spectrum allocation). However, real-world wireless networks are susceptible to temporal variations of wireless channel capacity and users' datasets. In this paper, we incorporate multi-granular system dynamics (MSDs) into FL, including (M1) dynamic wireless channel capacity, captured by a set of discrete-time events, called $\mathscr{D}$-Events, and (M2) dynamic datasets of users. The latter is characterized by (M2-a) modeling the dynamics of user's dataset size via an ordinary differential equation and (M2-b) introducing dynamic model drift}, formulated via a partial differential inequality} drawing concrete analytical connections between the dynamics of users' datasets and FL accuracy. We then conduct FL orchestration under MSDs by introducing dynamic cooperative FL with dedicated MAC schedulers (DCLM), exploiting the unique features of open radio access network (O-RAN). DCLM proposes (i) a hierarchical device-to-device (D2D)-assisted model training, (ii) dynamic control decisions through dedicated O-RAN MAC schedulers, and (iii) asymmetric user selection. We provide extensive theoretical analysis to study the convergence of DCLM. We then optimize the degrees of freedom (e.g., user selection and spectrum allocation) in DCLM through a highly non-convex optimization problem. We develop a systematic approach to obtain the solution for this problem, opening the door to solving a broad variety of network-aware FL optimization problems. We show the efficiency of DCLM via numerical simulations and provide a series of future directions.</description>

Abstract: Accurate decoding of Uplink Control Information (UCI) on the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) is essential for enabling 5G wireless links. This paper explores an AI/ML-based receiver design for PUCCH Format 0. Format 0 signaling encodes the UCI content within the phase of a known base waveform and even supports multiplexing of up to 12 users within the same time-frequency resources. The proposed neural network classifier, which we term UCINet0, is capable of predicting when no user is transmitting on the PUCCH, as well as decoding the UCI content for any number of multiplexed users (up to 12). The test results with simulated, hardware-captured (lab) and field datasets show that the UCINet0 model outperforms conventional correlation-based decoders across all SNR ranges and multiple fading scenarios.</description>

      <title>TraDE: Network and Traffic-aware Adaptive Scheduling for Microservices Under Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic architecture to microservices has enhanced flexibility in application design and its scalable execution. This approach typically uses a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform to deploy microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we propose a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE, which can adaptively redeploy microservice instances to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.2-1.5x across workloads while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36%, and showing robust adaptive capability to meet QoS targets under sustained workloads and dynamic networking conditions.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Throughput Estimation in Unstable LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new framework for analyzing capacity dynamics and throughput performance in Low Earth Orbit satellite networks (LSNs). It focuses on addressing critical gaps in existing models, particularly those concerning unreliable ISLs. Our work systematically resolves two inherent deficiencies in prior research: (1) the conflation of network capacity with maximum throughput, the latter being highly dependent on routing policies and thus failing to reflect the intrinsic characteristics of the system; and (2) the overestimation problem in flow network based throughput calculations, which often generate flow paths that are inconsistent with actual traffic paths. To address these issues, we develop the CAP-uLSN (Capacity under unstable LEO satellites networks) model to characterize time-varying network capacity under stochastic ISL availability.
  Furthermore, we propose a Monte Carlo Throughput Estimation (MCTE) framework that probabilistically evaluates aggregate throughput performance under dynamic traffic patterns and diverse routing schemes.
  These insights derived from the CAP-uLSN model and MCTE framework, provide theoretical guidance for optimizing routing schemes (e.g., path selection under throughput fluctuations) and designing adaptive billing models (e.g., distance-based pricing) in future LEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Enabling Network Policy Enforcement in Service Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portable service mesh implementations enable Layer 4 to Layer 7 policy enforcement across heterogeneous infrastructures, yet they depend on the underlying network's connectivity and policies. Layer 3 network policies govern IP traffic regardless of whether upper layers authorize the flow. While these policies are integral to security, correct enforcement often requires coordination across multiple teams, and achieving consistent policy behavior across heterogeneous environments is challenging. Studies show that most Kubernetes clusters do not enforce any network policies. We propose integrating Layer 3 network policy enforcement with service meshes to protect data-plane traffic in a portable, infrastructure-agnostic manner. This integration allows developers to define Layer 3-7 policies and to ensure enforcement across any infrastructure. Our solution builds an overlay Layer 3 network and enforces Layer 3 policies by routing traffic through specific policy enforcement points and applying default-deny principles with authorization keys. We prototyped our approach using Kubernetes and Istio and found that it adds less than 1ms of latency while supporting complex policies comparable to native Kubernetes network policies.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Digital Twins for Next-Generation Networks: Forecasting Traffic and Resource Management in 5G/6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As 5G and future 6G mobile networks become increasingly more sophisticated, the requirements for agility, scalability, resilience, and precision in real-time service provisioning cannot be met using traditional and heuristic-based resource management techniques, just like any advancing technology. With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</description>
