      <title>Mental Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article illustrates pedagogy through training in the handling of abstractions. Mental arithmetic is not limited to numerical calculation; one can mentally calculate primitives and simplify analytical expressions. Even if there is software that does this very well, this training retains its pedagogical value. Can we go further and consider geometric mental arithmetic: mentally proceeding with transformations of simple figures allowing the calculation of areas or volumes? It turns out that the intuition that allowed Archimedes to obtain his main geometric results, if we take only the ideas without the old-fashioned style, provides the opportunity for a pleasant and quite rich mental game that I present here in the form of a short narrative dialogue, not a philosophical tale because it does not bring any thesis, simply a story to be classified among the invitations to exercise the mind. It starts with the area of a triangle and ends with Guldin's two theorems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Primary Teacher Training through Academic Portfolios in Advanced Mathematics Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gap between theory and practice in mathematics education, particularly in primary-teacher education, necessitates innovative teaching methodologies. This paper explores the implementation of academic portfolios as a teaching innovation in Algebra and Number Systems I and II courses within the primary teacher education programme at Pontificia Universidad Cat\'olica de Chile. The methodology involved integrating academic portfolios to align course content with essential learning outcomes for future teaching roles. Implementation begins with a negotiation between students and teachers to establish a learning contract, followed by an overview of course rules, content, objectives, materials, and grading rubrics. Preliminary findings indicate that this innovative method enhances engagement with mathematical concepts, improves assessment efficacy in teacher training, and may contribute to enhanced preparation of primary mathematics teachers. The study highlights the role of portfolios in making students active participants in their learning, significantly enhancing the educational experience of teacher candidates. These findings suggest a promising avenue for future educational assessments and methodologies in mathematics, indicating that academic portfolios can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications in mathematics teacher education, potentially enhancing teacher preparation. While this study shows promising results, further research with larger samples and longer timeframes would be beneficial to establish causality and long-term impacts.</description>
