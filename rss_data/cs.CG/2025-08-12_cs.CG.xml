      <title>Compressibility Barriers to Neighborhood-Preserving Data Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To what extent is it possible to visualize high-dimensional datasets in a two- or three-dimensional space? We reframe this question in terms of embedding $n$-vertex graphs (representing the neighborhood structure of the input points) into metric spaces of low doubling dimension $d$, in such a way that maintains the separation between neighbors and non-neighbors. This seemingly lax embedding requirement is surprisingly difficult to satisfy. Our investigation shows that an overwhelming fraction of graphs require $d = \Omega(\log n)$. Even when considering sparse regular graphs, the situation does not improve, as an overwhelming fraction of such graphs requires $d= \Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$. The landscape changes dramatically when embedding into normed spaces. In particular, all but a vanishing fraction of graphs demand $d=\Theta(n)$. Finally, we study the implications of these results for visualizing data with intrinsic cluster structure. We find that graphs produced from a planted partition model with $k$ clusters on $n$ points typically require $d=\Omega(\log n)$, even when the cluster structure is salient. These results challenge the aspiration that constant-dimensional visualizations can faithfully preserve neighborhood structure.</description>

      <title>Summarizing Classed Region Maps with a Disk Choreme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chorematic diagrams are highly reduced schematic maps of geospatial data and processes. They can visually summarize complex situations using only a few simple shapes (choremes) placed upon a simplified base map. Due to the extreme reduction of data in chorematic diagrams, they tend to be produced manually; few automated solutions exist. In this paper we consider the algorithmic problem of summarizing classed region maps, such as choropleth or land use maps, using a chorematic diagram with a single disk choreme. It is infeasible to solve this problem exactly for large maps. Hence, we propose several point sampling strategies and use algorithms for classed point sets to efficiently find the best disk that represents one of the classes. We implemented our algorithm and experimentally compared sampling strategies and densities. The results show that with the right sampling strategy, high-quality results can be obtained already with moderately sized point sets and within seconds of computation time.</description>

      <title>Extracting Complex Topology from Multivariate Functional Approximation: Contours, Jacobi Sets, and Ridge-Valley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit continuous models, such as functional models and implicit neural networks, are an increasingly popular method for replacing discrete data representations with continuous, high-order, and differentiable surrogates. These models offer new perspectives on the storage, transfer, and analysis of scientific data. In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly extract complex topological features -- contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley graphs -- from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model, without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit continuous models.</description>

      <title>Flagifying the Dowker Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08025</link>

Abstract: The Dowker complex $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ is a simplicial complex capturing the topological interplay between two finite sets $X$ and $Y$ under some relation $R\subseteq X\times Y$. While its definition is asymmetric, the famous Dowker duality states that $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ and $\mathrm{D}_{R}(Y,X)$ have homotopy equivalent geometric realizations. We introduce the Dowker-Rips complex $\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y)$, defined as the flagification of the Dowker complex or, equivalently, as the maximal simplicial complex whose $1$-skeleton coincides with that of $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$. This is motivated by applications in topological data analysis, since as a flag complex, the Dowker-Rips complex is less expensive to compute than the Dowker complex. While the Dowker duality does not hold for Dowker-Rips complexes in general, we show that one still has that $\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y))\cong\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(Y,X))$ for $i=0,1$. We further show that this weakened duality extends to the setting of persistent homology, and quantify the ``failure" of the Dowker duality in homological dimensions higher than $1$ by means of interleavings. This makes the Dowker-Rips complex a less expensive, approximate version of the Dowker complex that is usable in topological data analysis. Indeed, we provide a Python implementation of the Dowker-Rips complex and, as an application, we show that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Dowker complex in a tumor microenvironment classification pipeline. In that pipeline, using the Dowker-Rips complex leads to increase in speed while retaining classification performance.</description>

      <title>Blown up by an equilateral: Poncelet triangles about the incircle and their degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19464v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tour several Euclidean properties of Poncelet triangles inscribed in an ellipse and circumscribing the incircle, including loci of triangle centers and envelopes of key objects. We also show that a number of degenerate behaviors are triggered by the presence of an equilateral triangle in the family.</description>
