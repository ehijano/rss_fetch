      <title>CytoDINO: Risk-Aware and Biologically-Informed Adaptation of DINOv3 for Bone Marrow Cytomorphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone marrow cell cytomorphology analysis is critical for the diagnosis of hematological malignancies but remains a labor-intensive process subject to significant inter-observer variability. While recent foundation models have shown promise in computational pathology, they often require extensive computational resources and fail to account for the asymmetric risks associated with clinical misdiagnosis. We introduce CytoDINO, a framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL) dataset by fine-tuning DINOv3 using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our primary contribution is a novel Hierarchical Focal Loss with Critical Penalties, which encodes biological relationships between cell lineages and explicitly penalizes clinically dangerous misclassifications (e.g., classifying blasts as normal cells). CytoDINO achieves an 88.2% weighted F1 score and 76.5% macro F1 on a held-out test set of 21 cell classes. By utilizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning with only 8% trainable parameters on a single NVIDIA RTX 5080, we demonstrate that consumer-grade hardware can match specialized infrastructure. Furthermore, confidence-based selective prediction yields 99.5% accuracy on 67% of samples, suggesting a viable pathway for clinical deployment where high-uncertainty cases are flagged for expert review</description>

      <title>A generalized framework for procedural generation of three-dimensional static and dynamic plant model geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new framework for procedural generation of dynamic 3D plant model geometries, which has been implemented in the Helios modeling system. Key goals of this work were to develop a model that 1) has a generalized set of parameters that are conserved across species, which are botanically-consistent and readily measurable; 2) significantly reduces the time and effort needed to create photorealistic, dynamically evolving plant models; 3) allows for encoding of the entire plant structure into a character-based representation that can integrated with machine learning models, and 4) includes realistic and computationally efficient collision physics. A model framework that satisfies these specifications is presented in this report. The model was implemented in the Helios C++ and PyHelios Python frameworks, which are open-source libraries that can be used to generate 3D plant geometries based on this model.</description>

      <title>Trick or Treat? Free-ranging dogs use human behavioural cues for foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals that display behavioural flexibility and adaptability thrive in urban environments, due to their ability to exploit novel anthropogenic resources. Since humans are an important component of such urban environments, animals that apply heterospecific learning in their decision-making are more likely to succeed as urban adapters. Free-ranging dogs, that have been living in human-dominated environments for centuries, are excellent urban adapters. In this study, we sought to understand the role and extent of human behavioural cues in decision-making during foraging by free-ranging dogs. We investigated whether these dogs were more attracted to items that humans appeared to be eating. When presented with a real and a fake biscuit, the dogs showed a clear preference for the food item. Between two identical biscuits, they chose the one that had been bitten by a human. However, when a fake biscuit was bitten and presented with a real one, the dogs failed to choose one over the other, suggesting a strong influence of the human-provided cue of biting over the natural cue of the smell of the food item. The dogs displayed left-bias during food choice across experimental conditions. These results demonstrate that dog foraging choices in urban environments are a mix of heterospecific learning and independent decision-making, highlighting an important facet behind their success in anthropogenic habitats. This also underscores the high level of dependence that free-ranging dogs have on humans in the urban habitat, not only as a source of food, but as an integral part of their ecological niche.</description>

      <title>Life as Non-Normal Chemical Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Life is commonly described as a self-organized, far-from-equilibrium process that maintains internal order by consuming free energy and exporting entropy. This thermodynamic view underlies diverse theoretical frameworks -- from autopoiesis and relational biology to autocatalytic sets and hypercycles -- yet dissipation is typically treated as a necessary consequence of living organization rather than as a property shaped by its internal dynamics. Here, through explicit calculations of biotic chemical reactions and empirical documentation, we show that living systems universally function as non-normal chemical accelerators. Their elevated entropy production emerges from the asymmetric and hierarchical architecture of their biochemical networks. We introduce a general conceptual and mathematical framework in which biological structuration is understood as a dynamical property. Characterized by asymmetric couplings and transient amplification despite asymptotic stability, non-normal dynamics are shown to naturally generate kinetic acceleration, enhanced energy throughput, and phase-transition-like reorganizations without classical bifurcations. In this view, biological organization is not merely compatible with dissipation but actively structured to amplify free-energy flux and entropy export. We support this perspective with empirical and theoretical evidence that biochemical networks generically give rise to intrinsically non-normal operators through non-reciprocal interactions and hierarchical design. This framework yields testable predictions for dissipation rates, robustness, and evolutionary design principles, and suggests a kinetic principle of evolution in which living systems preferentially construct increasingly non-normal reaction architectures, driving sustained amplification of chemical fluxes and entropy flow.</description>
