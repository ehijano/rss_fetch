      <title>Rigidity control of general origami structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami, the traditional paper-folding art, has inspired the modern design of numerous flexible structures in science and engineering. In particular, origami structures with different physical properties have been studied and utilized for various applications. More recently, several deterministic and stochastic approaches have been developed for controlling the rigidity or softness of the Miura-ori structures. However, the rigidity control of other origami structures is much less understood. In this work, we study the rigidity control of general origami structures via enforcing or relaxing the planarity condition of their polygonal facets. Specifically, by performing numerical simulations on a large variety of origami structures with different facet selection rules, we systematically analyze how the geometry and topology of different origami structures affect their degrees of freedom (DOF). We also propose a hypergeometric model based on the selection process to derive theoretical bounds for the probabilistic properties of the rigidity change, which allows us to identify key origami structural variables that theoretically govern the DOF evolution and thereby the critical rigidity percolation transition in general origami structures. Moreover, we develop a simple unified model that describes the relationship between the critical percolation density, the origami facet geometry, and the facet selection rules, which enables efficient prediction of the critical transition density for high-resolution origami structures. Altogether, our work highlights the intricate similarities and differences in the rigidity control of general origami structures, shedding light on the design of flexible mechanical metamaterials for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound in dense simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed of sound of simple dense fluids is shown to exhibit a pronounced freezing temperature scaling of the form $c_{\rm s}/v_{\rm T}\simeq \sqrt{\gamma} +\alpha (T_{\rm fr}/T)^{\beta}$, where $c_s$ is the speed of sound, $v_{\rm T}$ is the characteristic thermal velocity, $\gamma$ is the ideal gas heat capacity ratio, $T$ is the temperature, $T_{\rm fr}$ is the freezing temperature, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are dimensionless parameters. For the Lennard-Jones fluid we get $\gamma=5/3$, $\alpha\simeq 7$ with a weak temperature dependence, and $\beta = 1/3$. Similar scaling works in several real liquids, such as argon, krypton, xenon, nitrogen, and methane. In this case, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are substance-dependent fitting parameters. A comparison between the prediction of this freezing temperature scaling and a recent experimental measurement of the speed of sound in methane under conditions of planetary interiors is presented and discussed. The results provide a simple practical tool to estimate the speed of sound in regimes where no experimental data are yet available.</description>

      <title>Space-time crystals from particle-like topological solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals are unexpected states of matter that spontaneously break time translation symmetry either in a discrete or continuous manner. However, spatially-mesoscale space-time crystals that break both the space and time symmetries have not been reported. Here we report a continuous space-time crystal in a nematic liquid crystal driven by ambient-power, constant-intensity unstructured light. Our numerically constructed 4-dimensional configurations exhibit good agreement with these experimental findings. While meeting the established criteria to identify time-crystalline order, both experiments and computer simulations reveal a space-time crystallization phase formed by particle-like topological solitons. The robustness against temporal perturbations and spatiotemporal dislocations shows the stability and rigidity of the studied space-time crystals, which relates to their locally topological nature and many-body interactions between emergent spontaneously-twisted, particle-like solitonic building blocks. Their potential technological utility includes optical devices, photonic space-time crystal generators, telecommunications, and anti-counterfeiting designs, among others.</description>

      <title>Emergent discrete space-time crystal of Majorana-like quasiparticles in chiral liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals spontaneously break the time translation symmetry, as recently has been frequently reported in quantum systems. Here we describe the observation of classical analogues of both 1+1-dimensional and 2+1-dimensional discrete space-time crystals in a liquid crystal system driven by a Floquet electrical signal. These classical time crystals comprise particle-like structural features and exists over a wide range of temperatures and electrical driving conditions. The phenomenon-enabling period-doubling effect comes from their topological Majorana-like quasiparticle features, where periodic inter-transformations of co-existing topological solitons and disclinations emerge in response to external stimuli and play pivotal roles. Our discrete space-time crystals exhibit robustness against temporal perturbations and spatial defects, behaving like a time-crystalline analogues of a smectic phase. Our findings show that the simultaneous symmetry breaking in time and space can be a widespread occurrence in numerous open systems, not only in quantum but also in a classical soft matter context.</description>

      <title>Defect-Mediated Aggregation and Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Active XY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an ``active XY model'' that incorporates key elements of both the classical XY model and the Vicsek model to study the role of topological defects in active matter systems. This model features self-propelled particles with XY spin degrees of freedom on a lattice and introduces a self-propulsion parameter controlling the directional bias of particle motion. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that self-propulsion induces motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), where particles aggregate into clusters around topological defects with positive vortex charge. In contrast, negative charge defects tend to dissipate. We analyze the evolution of these clusters and show that their growth follows a two-stage exponential relaxation process, with characteristic time scaling as $\tau \sim L^{3}$ with the system size $L$, reminiscent of first-order phase separation in equilibrium systems. Our results highlight the important role of topological defects in phase separations and clustering behavior in active systems, bridging nonequilibrium dynamics and equilibrium theory.</description>

      <title>pH-dependent interfacial rheology of polymer membranes assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces using hydrogen bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembly of polymers at liquid interfaces using non-covalent interactions has emerged as a promising technique to reversibly produce self-healing membranes. Besides the assembly process, it is also crucial to control the mechanical properties of these membranes. Here, we measure the interfacial rheological properties of PMAA-PPO (polymethacrylic acidpolypropylene oxide) polymer membranes assembled using hydrogen bonds at liquid-oil interfaces. Varying the pH enables us to modify the degree of ionization of the PMAA chains, and hence their ability to establish hydrogen interactions with PPO. Frequency sweeps of the interfacial layers show a crossover between a viscous regime at low frequencies and an elastic regime at high frequencies. The crossover elastic modulus decreases by half after one hour of the experiment over the pH range investigated, which can be accounted for by a decrease of the layer thickness as pH increases. Furthermore we find that the crossover frequency varies exponentially with the degree of ionization of PMAA. To account for these observations, we propose a simple picture where the short PPO chains behave as non-covalent cross-linkers that bridge several PMAA chains. The dissociation rate and hence the crossover frequency are controlled by the number of PO units per PPO chain involved in the hydrogen bonds.</description>

      <title>From shallow to full wrapping: geometry and deformability dictate lipid vesicle internalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformability of vesicles critically influences their engulfment by lipid membranes, a process central to endocytosis, viral entry, drug delivery, and intercellular transport. While theoretical models have long predicted this influence, direct experimental validation has remained elusive. Here, we combine experiments with continuum simulations to quantify how vesicle deformability affects the engulfment of small giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) by larger GUVs under depletion-induced adhesion. Using 3D confocal reconstructions, we extract vesicle shape, curvature, wrapping fraction, and the bendo-capillary length, a characteristic length scale that balances membrane bending and adhesion forces. We find that when vesicle size exceeds this length scale, engulfment is primarily governed by geometry. In contrast, when vesicle size is comparable to this scale, deformability strongly affects the transition between shallow, deep, and fully wrapped states, leading to suppression of full engulfment of vesicles. These findings connect theoretical predictions with direct measurements and offer a unified framework for understanding vesicle-mediated uptake across both synthetic and biological systems, including viral entry, synthetic cell design, drug delivery, and nanoparticle internalization.</description>

      <title>Using optical tweezers to simultaneously trap, charge and measure the charge of a microparticle in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17591v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers are widely used as a highly sensitive tool to measure forces on micron-scale particles. One such application is the measurement of the electric charge of a particle, which can be done with high precision in liquids, air, or vacuum. We experimentally investigate how the trapping laser itself can electrically charge such a particle, in our case a $\sim 1\,\mathrm{\mu m\;SiO_2}$ sphere in air. We model the charging mechanism as a two-photon process which reproduces the experimental data with high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in a model artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid filled pipes are ubiquitous in both man-made constructions and living organisms. In the latter, biological pipes, such as arteries, have unique properties as their walls are made of soft, incompressible, highly deformable materials. In this article, we experimentally investigate wave propagation in a model artery: an elastomer strip coupled to a rigid water channel. We measure out-of-plane waves using synthetic Schlieren imaging, and evidence a single dispersive mode which resembles the pulse wave excited by the heartbeat. By imposing an hydrostatic pressure difference, we reveal the strong influence of pre-stress on the dispersion of this wave. Using a model based on the acoustoelastic theory accounting for the material rheology and for the large static deformation of the strip, we demonstrate that the imposed pressure affects wave propagation through an interplay between stretching, orthogonal to the propagation direction, and curvature-induced rigidity. We finally highlight the relevance of our results in the biological setting, by discussing the determination of the arterial wall's material properties from pulse wave velocity measurements in the presence of pre-stress.</description>

      <title>The Scaling of Triboelectric Charging Powder Drops for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triboelectrification of granular materials is a poorly understood phenomenon that alters particle behaviour, impacting industrial processes such as bulk powder handling and conveying. At small scales ($&lt; 1 g$) net charging of powders has been shown to vary linearly with the total particle surface area and hence mass for a given size distribution. This work investigates the scaling relation of granular triboelectric charging, with small, medium ($&lt; 200 g$), and large-scale ($\sim 400 kg$) laboratory testing of industrially relevant materials using a custom powder dropping apparatus and Faraday cup measurements. Our results demonstrate that this scaling is broken before industrially relevant scales are reached. Charge (Q) scaling with mass (m) was fitted with a function of the form $Q \propto m^b$ and $b$ exponents ranging from $0.68\ \pm\ 0.01$ to $0.86\ \pm\ 0.02$ were determined. These exponents lie between those that would be expected from the surface area of the bulk powder ($b = 2 / 3$) and the total particle surface area ($b = 1$). This scaling relation is found to hold across the powders tested and at varying humidities.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of active particles in oscillatory Poiseuille flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active particles exhibit complex transport dynamics in flows through confined geometries such as channels or pores. In this work, we employ a generalized Taylor dispersion (GTD) theory to study the long-time dispersion behavior of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in an oscillatory Poiseuille flow within a planar channel. We quantify the time-averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient as a function of the flow speed, flow oscillation frequency, and particle activity. In the weak-activity limit, asymptotic analysis shows that activity can either enhance or hinder the dispersion compared to the passive case. For arbitrary activity levels, we numerically solve the GTD equations and validate the results with Brownian dynamics simulations. We show that the dispersion coefficient could vary non-monotonically with both the flow speed and particle activity. Furthermore, the dispersion coefficient shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of the flow oscillation frequency, exhibiting distinct minima and maxima at different frequencies. The observed oscillatory dispersion results from the interplay between self-propulsion and oscillatory flow advection -- a coupling absent in passive or steady systems. Our results show that time-dependent flows can be used to tune the dispersion of active particles in confinement.</description>

      <title>Universality of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of driven probes reveal nonequilibrium transitions in complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs, typical of active microrheology setups, exhibit poorly understood nonequilibrium behaviors because of the intricate self-organization of their mesoscopic constituents. In this work we show how to identify changes in the microstructural conformation of the fluid by monitoring the variance of the probe position, based on a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem. To illustrate our method, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of an effective model of micellar solution, and we link the different scaling regimes in the variance of the probe's position to the transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes the accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind the nonlinear friction curves recently measured in micellar solutions, pointing at a mechanism for the observed multi-step rheology. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method, applicable in experiments, to detect nonequilibrium transitions in the structure of complex fluids.</description>
