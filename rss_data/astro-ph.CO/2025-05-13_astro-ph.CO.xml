      <title>Gravity-selected cluster samples: a new take on the Compton Y-mass relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling relation between the Compton Y parameter and mass in a gravity-selected sample of galaxy clusters, selected based on their gravitational lensing effects on background galaxies. Unlike ICM-selected samples, gravity-selected clusters do not require corrections for selection biases in intracluster medium (ICM) properties, such as Compton Y, since these properties are not used for selection. Our sample consists of 13 gravity-selected clusters with weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7 and redshifts in the range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4$, drawn from the peak catalog of shear-selected clusters in Oguri et al. (2021). We determined spectroscopic redshifts using SDSS spectroscopy, derived tangential radial profiles from HSC shear data, and calculated cluster masses by fitting a Navarro, Frenk, \&amp; White (1997) profile. Compton Y measurements were obtained from ACT maps. Our sample reveals a broader scatter in the Compton Y-mass scaling relation compared to ICM-selected samples, even after accounting for selection effects and mass bias of the latter, that we find to be $(1-b) = 0.72 \pm 0.09$. Additionally, we identify a second population of clusters with unusually small Compton Y for their mass, which is absent in ICM-selected samples. This second population comprises $13^{+10}_{-8}$\% of the entire sample, with O19 currently being the only secure representative.</description>

      <title>Constraining gas motion and non-thermal pressure beyond the core of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed spectroscopic study of the gas dynamics and hydrostatic mass bias of the galaxy cluster Abell 2029, utilizing high-resolution observations from XRISM Resolve. Abell 2029, known for its cool core and relaxed X-ray morphology, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of gas motions beyond the central region. Expanding upon prior studies that revealed low turbulence and bulk motions within the core, our analysis covers regions out to the scale radius $R_{2500}$ (670~kpc) based on three radial pointings extending from the cluster center toward the northern side. We obtain accurate measurements of bulk and turbulent velocities along the line of sight. The results indicate that non-thermal pressure accounts for no more than 2% of the total pressure at all radii, with a gradual decrease outward. The observed radial trend differs from many numerical simulations, which often predict an increase in non-thermal pressure fraction at larger radii. These findings suggest that deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium are small, leading to a hydrostatic mass bias of around 2% across the observed area.</description>

      <title>A G2-Holonomy Model for Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration in M-theory: Alleviating the Hubble Tension through Geometric Vacuum Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework is presented within an eleven-dimensional M-theory scenario wherein dynamical geometric moduli, arising from a G2-holonomy compactification, yield an evolving cosmological term Lambda(z). This "geometric vacuum energy" is distinct from conventional dark energy in two main aspects: (i) its origin lies in extra-dimensional fluxes and instanton-like corrections embedded within the moduli potential, and (ii) it exhibits a moderate peak at intermediate redshifts. This feature provides a mechanism to partially mitigate the Hubble tension, elevating the inferred H0 value from ~67 to ~69.5 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 without disrupting the overall concordance of the cosmological model. Furthermore, the inclusion of mild spatial openness (Omega_k0 ~ 0.097) and a slightly reduced matter fraction (Omega_m0 ~ 0.25) relative to standard LambdaCDM allows the geometry-driven Lambda(z) to naturally maintain a cosmic age near 13.8 Gyr. Initial numerical checks indicate that the calibrated model achieves chi^2/nu ~ 1 for H(z) data (chi^2 ~ 26 for 24 points) and yields a structure growth amplitude S8 ~ 0.74, consistent with current observational bounds. While not a definitive solution, these results illustrate a potential pathway for reconciling certain late-time cosmological puzzles through a slight deviation from a pure cosmological constant, rooted in G2-compactified M-theory. The findings suggest a UV-complete geometric origin for dark energy. Further developments, including detailed statistical analyses, N-body simulations, and explicit G2 constructions, are anticipated to refine and test the parameter space of this model.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the values of the fundamental constants at a look-back time of 7.3 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the redshifted spectral lines can provide a measure of the fundamental constants over large look-back times. Current grand unified theories predict an evolution in these and astronomical observations offer the only experimental measure of the values of the constants over large time scales. Of particular interest are the dimensionless constants; the fine structure constant ($\alpha$), the proton-electron mass ratio ($\mu$) and the proton g-factor ($g_p$), since these do not require a `standard metre-stick'. Here we present a re-analysis of the 18-cm hydroxyl (OH) lines at $z=0.89$, recently detected with the MeerKAT telescope, towards the radio source PKS\,1830-211. Utilizing the previous constraint of $\Delta\mu/\mu=(-1.8\pm1.2)\times10^{-7}$, we obtain $\Delta (\alpha g_p^{0.27})/(\alpha g_p^{0.27})\lesssim5.7\times10^{-5}$, $\Delta \alpha/\alpha\lesssim2.3\times10^{-3}$ and $\Delta g_p/g_p\lesssim7.9\times10^{-3}$. These new constraints are consistent with no evolution over a look-back time of 7.3 Gyr and provide another valuable data point in the putative evolution in the constants.</description>

      <title>Isotropy Test with Quasars Using Method of Smoothed Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To assess the significance and scale dependence of anomalous large scale modes in the CatWISE quasar data, we generate smoothed number density fields on the sphere and study their extreme values -- maximum, minimum, maximum antipodal difference. By comparing these summary statistics to those obtained from random isotropic realisations of the data, we determine the statistical significance of large scale modes as a function of smoothing scale. We perform our analysis using five different versions of the data -- the original quasar map, the maps after separately subtracting the ecliptic bias and the CMB dipole, the map obtained after subtracting both, and the map after subtracting the ecliptic bias and anomalous dipole inferred in \cite{Secrest2021}. We find that the ecliptic-corrected, CMB dipole-removed map exhibits large scale modes that are in tension with random realisations of the data (p-values $p \sim 10^{-4}$), over a wide range of smoothing scales $\pi/8 \leq \delta \leq \pi/2$. The most prominent feature in the data is an underdensity in the southern galactic plane at $(b,\ell) = (-31^\circ,78^\circ)$, which reaches its highest statistical significance when smoothed on scales $\delta = \pi/6$ ($p \ll 10^{-5}$). Notably, the minima statistics align with the maximum antipodal difference statistics, whereas the maxima do not. This suggests that the observed dipole-like behavior in the data is primarily driven by the underdensity in the southern sky. The ecliptic corrected, anomalous dipole subtracted map reduces the significance of any residual anisotropic features, but an underdensity in the south sky persists with p-value $p =0.0018$.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advancements in cosmology with galaxy clusters. Galaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the Universe. Consequently the cluster number density as a function of cluster mass, or cluster abundance, is sensitive to cosmological parameters, particularly the matter density of the Universe $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the amplitude of matter density fluctuation $\sigma_8$. In this review, we describe the methods used to detect galaxy clusters through optical near-infrared (O-NIR), X-ray, and CMB observations, outlining the advantages and disadvantages of cluster detection through different wavelengths. We describe methods for measuring cluster mass, with a particular focus on calibration by WL measurements. We then discuss how the connection between observables in different wavelengths and cluster abundance can be modeled through a cluster selection function and MOR, and quantify the impact of marginalization of nuisance parameters on cosmological constraints. Finally, we also walk through the recent results of cosmological constraints by cluster abundance with the O-NIR, X-ray, and CMB observations.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory for Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is modified by quantum corrections, described by a series of higher-dimension operators. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models in which the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated by the Higgs field is consistent with CMB observations and can lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The fallacies of LCDM falsifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous arguments have emerged suggesting that the LCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model may be inconsistent with observational data, requiring more or less radical revisions. Notable examples include the Hubble tension, the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements of the Hubble constant, as well as tensions in measurements of cosmic structure growth. These issues have led some to question the validity of the LCDM framework and consider possible modifications or alternative models.
  However, upon closer inspection, many of these critiques stem from methodological or interpretive disagreements rather than from clear falsifications in the strict Popperian sense. Karl Popper proposed that scientific theories must be testable and falsifiable; in other words, a theory should be rejected if it fails a specific, reproducible test. Yet, many of the alleged inconsistencies within LCDM, while statistically significant, are not definitive falsifications but rather indicators of areas needing refinement or more complex modeling within the same framework.
  Thus, I review the recent claims about LCDM's limitations and analyze why they often reflect individual biases or philosophical preferences, rather than rigorous scientific falsifications. For example, alternative cosmological models such as MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) or models incorporating new physics like quintessence or modified gravity are sometimes advocated based on theoretical appeal rather than direct evidence from critical tests. In many cases, these arguments for falsifying LCDM reveal more about subjective interpretations of data than about concrete observational contradictions.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Matter Annihilation in the Sun with the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade will provide unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles annihilating in the core of the Sun. For dark matter candidates with spin-dependent couplings to nuclei and that annihilate significantly to tau leptons or neutrinos, we find that the IceCube Upgrade will be capable of testing parameter space that is beyond the reach of existing direct detection experiments. After calculating the sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to dark matter annihilation in the Sun, we explore dark matter models that could be tested by this experiment, identifying two classes of scenarios as promising targets for such searches.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Fundamental Parameters of Galaxies on the Star-forming Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS) serves as a critical framework for understanding galaxy evolution, highlighting the relationship between star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses M_* across cosmic time. Despite its significance, the origin of the 0.3-0.4 dex dispersion in the SFMS remains a key unresolved question. Uncovering the origin of dispersion is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Using a large sample of approximately 500,000 galaxies, we reveal an unprecedented symmetry in the distribution of key structural properties-effective radius (R_{\rm e}), stellar surface density (M_*/R_{\rm e}^2), and morphology on the SFMS. This symmetry implies that galaxies with high (above SFMS) and low (below SFMS) SFRs share similar fundamental parameters. Moreover, galaxies with smaller R_{\rm e} or higher M_*/R_{\rm e}^2 exhibit greater dispersion in SFR. This dispersion reflects the response to fluctuations in cosmic accretion flows, while the SFR itself represents the time-averaged effect over the gas consumption timescale. Shorter gas consumption timescales, associated with higher M_*/R_{\rm e}^2, lead to greater SFR dispersion. Our results reveal that the variation of SFR originates from the oscillation of accretion flow and is regulated by the stellar surface density.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame and present a comprehensive analysis that spans background dynamics, linear perturbations, thermodynamics, quantum gravity constraints and baryogenesis. Using a dynamical systems approach, we classify all analytical critical points for a representative set of scalar field potentials: axions (ALPs), cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential (ekpyrotic) with $\Lambda$, quintessence, and scalar field dark matter. We show that a chameleon-like coupling $f(\phi)=e^{\beta\phi}$ modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. Analytical transfer matrices for primordial tensor modes are derived, revealing a scale-dependent break in the gravitational-wave spectrum whose position and amplitude are fixed by the coupling parameter $\beta$. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. Penrose's Weyl-curvature hypothesis is recovered dynamically: during an ekpyrotic phase with $\omega\gg1$ the Weyl invariant decays as $a^{-6(1+\omega)}$, resetting gravitational entropy without violating the generalized second law. A time-varying $\phi$ simultaneously generates an effective chemical potential $\mu_{B}\simeq\beta\dot{\phi}/M^{2}$, allowing for spontaneous high-scale baryogenesis whose back reaction on $\phi$ is negligible for $M\gtrsim10^{15}\sqrt{\beta}$ GeV. Swampland distance and de Sitter criteria are automatically satisfied because the ekpyrotic phase confines the field excursion to $\Delta\phi\lesssim\mathcal{O}(1)M_{\rm Pl}$. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation with Vector-Like Quark Stabilisation and the ACT spectral index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034$. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$, which is 2.74$\sigma$ below the ACT mean value. We show that when an otherwise metastable Standard Model Higgs Inflation potential is stabilised by the addition of vector-like quark pairs and the potential is renormalised in the Jordan frame, the value of $n_s$ is generally larger than 0.965 and can explain the ACT observation. As an example, assuming the 2022 PDG direct measurement central value for the t quark mass, $m_{t} = 172.69$ GeV, and central values for the SM inputs to the renormalisation group equations, we obtain $n_s = 0.9792 - 0.9844$ for the case of three isosinglet vector-like B quarks with mass $m_{Q}$ in the range 1-3 TeV, with the lowest value of the $n_s$ range being 1.44$\sigma$ above the ACT mean value. The model predicts primordial gravitational wave with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.87 \times 10^{-3} - 1.21 \times 10^{-2}$ for $m_{Q} =$ 1-3 TeV, which will be easily observable in forthcoming CMB experiments. Observation of vector-like quarks of mass close to 1 TeV mass combined with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 0.1$ would support the model.</description>

Abstract: In particle physics and cosmology, distinguishing subtle new physics signals from established backgrounds is always a fundamental challenge for individual phenomenologists. This paper presents a simple and robust statistical framework to evaluate the compatibility of highly motivated (HM) theoretical models with the residual of the experimental results, focusing on scenarios where data appears consistent with background predictions. We develop a likelihood ratio test procedure that compares null and alternative hypotheses, emphasizing cases where new physics introduces small deviations from the background. We demonstrate the approach through two concrete examples, a localized excess and a modulation over an oscillatory background. We derive explicit conditions under which the effect of the background on the residual of the data must be accounted for. The framework's practicality is highlighted and in addition to the limitation, strategies to simplify complex background modeling are discussed.</description>

      <title>Assessing the effect of mass-model assumptions on measuring the Hubble constant from the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal</title>

Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, which is a crucial parameter in astrophysics and cosmology, is under significant tension. We explore an independent technique to measure $H_0$ based on the time-delay cosmography with strong gravitational lensing of a supernova lensed by a galaxy cluster, focusing on SN Refsdal in MACS J1149.5+2223, the first gravitationally lensed supernova with resolved multiple images. We carefully examine the dependence of constraints on the Hubble constant on the choice of lens mass models, employing 23 lens mass models with different assumptions on dark matter halos and external perturbations. Remarkably, we observe that the dependence on the choice of lens mass models is not significantly large, suggesting the robustness of the constraint on the Hubble constant from SN Refsdal. We combine measurements for the 23 lens mass models to obtain $H_0=70.0^{+4.7}_{-4.9}km/s/Mpc$ assuming equal weighting. We find that best-fitting Hubble constant values correlate with radial density profiles of the lensing cluster, implying a room for improving the constraint on the Hubble constant with future observations of more multiple images. We also find a clear correlation between best-fitting Hubble constant values and magnification factors of supernova multiple images. This correlation highlights the importance of gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae for accurate and robust Hubble constant measurements.</description>

      <title>Evidence for large baryonic feedback at low and intermediate redshifts from kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations with ACT and DESI photometric galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in cosmological observations have provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the distribution of baryons relative to the underlying matter. In this work, we show that the gas is more extended than the dark matter, and the amount of baryonic feedback at $z \lesssim 1$ disfavors low-feedback models such as that of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG compared with high-feedback models such as that of the original Illustris simulation. This has important implications for bridging the gap between theory and observations and understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, a better grasp of the baryon-dark matter link is critical to future cosmological analyses, which are currently impeded by our limited knowledge of baryonic feedback. Here, we measure the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), stacked on the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging survey. This is the first analysis to use photometric redshifts for reconstructing galaxy velocities. Due to the large number of galaxies comprising the DESI imaging survey, this is the highest signal-to-noise stacked kSZ measurement to date: we detect the signal at 13$\sigma$, finding strong evidence that the gas is more spread out than the dark matter, as well as a preference for larger feedback compared to some commonly used state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. Our work opens up the possibility of recalibrating large hydrodynamical simulations using the kSZ effect. In addition, our findings point towards a way of alleviating inconsistencies between weak lensing surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, such as the `low $S_8$' tension, and shed light on long-standing enigmas in astrophysics, such as the `missing baryon' problem.</description>

      <title>Modeling Foreground Spatial Variations in 21 cm Gaussian Process Component Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have been extensively utilized as nonparametric models for component separation in 21 cm data analyses. This exploits the distinct spectral behavior of the cosmological and foreground signals, which are modeled through the GP covariance kernel. Previous approaches have employed a global GP kernel along all lines of sight (LoS). In this work, we study Bayesian approaches that allow for spatial variations in foreground kernel parameters, testing them against simulated HI intensity mapping observations. We consider a no-pooling (NP) model, which treats each LoS independently by fitting for separate covariance kernels, and a hierarchical Gaussian Process (HGP) model that allows for variation in kernel parameters between different LoS, regularized through a global hyperprior. We find that accounting for spatial variations in the GP kernel parameters results in a significant improvement in cosmological signal recovery, achieving up to a 30% reduction in the standard deviation of the residual distribution and improved model predictive performance. Allowing for spatial variations in GP kernel parameters also improves the recovery of the HI power spectra and wavelet scattering transform coefficients. Whilst the NP model achieves superior recovery as measured by the residual distribution, it demands extensive computational resources, faces formidable convergence challenges, and is prone to overfitting. Conversely, the HGP model strikes a balance between the accuracy and robustness of the signal recovery. Further improvements to the HGP model will require more physically motivated modeling of foreground spatial variations.</description>

      <title>Hints of Nonminimally Coupled Gravity in DESI 2024 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are two of the most robust observations in cosmology. The recent BAO measurements from the DESI collaboration have presented, for the first time, inconsistency between BAO and CMB within the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, indicating a preference for dynamical dark energy over a cosmological constant. We analyze the theoretical implication of the DESI BAO observation for dark energy and gravity employing a nonparametric reconstruction approach for both the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(a)$ and the effective field theory coefficients. We find that the DESI data can rule out quintessence dark energy by indicating a crossing of the phantom divide at $z\lesssim1$. Furthermore, when analyzed within the broad context of Horndeski gravity which includes general relativity and many known modified gravity theories such as generalized Galileons, $f(R)$ and Brans-Dicke, our result implies that gravity should be nonminimally coupled to explain the observations, establishing the DESI result as the first hint of modified gravity. Based on these insights, we propose the \textit{thawing gravity} model to explain the nonminimal coupling and phantom crossing indicated by observation, which also fits better to DESI BAO, CMB and type Ia Supernovae data than $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts as a probe of gravity on cosmological scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential for improving constraints on gravity by leveraging correlations in the dispersion measure derived from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in combination with cosmic shear. Specifically, we focus on Horndeski gravity, inferring the kinetic braiding and Planck mass run rate from a stage-4 cosmic shear mock survey alongside a survey comprising $10^4$ FRBs. For the inference pipeline, we utilise the Boltzmann code \texttt{hi\_class} to predict the linear matter power spectrum in modified gravity scenarios, while non-linear corrections are obtained from the halo-model employed in \texttt{HMcode}, including feedback mechanisms. Our findings indicate that FRBs can disentangle degeneracies between baryonic feedback and cosmological parameters, as well as the mass of massive neutrinos. Since these parameters are also degenerate with modified gravity parameters, the inclusion of FRBs can enhance constraints on Horndeski parameters by up to $40$ percent, despite being a less significant measurement. Additionally, we apply our model to current FRB data and use the uncertainty in the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation to impose limits on gravity. However, due to the limited sample size of current data, constraints are predominantly influenced by theoretical priors. Despite this, our study demonstrates that FRBs will significantly augment the limited set of cosmological probes available, playing a critical role in providing alternative tests of feedback, cosmology, and gravity. All codes used in this work are made publically available.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hubble constant using localized and unlocalized fast radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is one of the most important parameters in the standard $\rm \Lambda CDM$ model. The measurements given by the main two methods show a gap larger than $4\sigma$, which is known as Hubble tension. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic pulses with durations of milliseconds. They can be used as cosmological probes. We constrain $H_0$ using localized and nonlocalized FRBs. We first used 108 localized FRBs to constrain $H_0$ using the probability distributions of \DMhost and \DMIGM from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Then, we used a Monte Carlo sampling to calculate the pseudo-redshift distributions of 527 nonlocalized FRBs from CHIME observations. The 108 localized FRBs yield a constraint of $H_0=69.40_{-1.97}^{+2.14}$ ${\rm km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$, which lies between the early- and late-time values. The constraint of $H_{0}$ from nonlocalized FRBs yields $H_0=68.81_{-0.68}^{+0.68}$ ${\rm km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. This result indicates that the uncertainty on the constraint of $H_0$ drops to $\sim1\%$ when the number of localized FRBs is increased to $\sim500$. These uncertainties only include the statistical error. The systematic errors are also discussed and play a dominant role in the current sample.</description>

      <title>Methods for robustly measuring the minimum spanning tree and other field level statistics from galaxy surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field level statistics, such as the minimum spanning tree (MST), have been shown to be a promising tool for parameter inference in cosmology. However, applications to real galaxy surveys are challenging, due to the presence of small scale systematic effects and non-trivial survey selection functions. Since many field level statistics are 'hard-wired', the common practice is to forward model survey systematic effects to synthetic galaxy catalogues. However, this can be computationally demanding and produces results that are a product of cosmology and systematic effects, making it difficult to directly compare results from different experiments. We introduce a method for inverting survey systematic effects through a Monte Carlo subsampling technique where galaxies are assigned probabilities based on their galaxy weight and survey selection functions. Small scale systematic effects are mitigated through the addition of a point-process smoothing technique called jittering. The inversion technique removes the requirement for a computational and labour intensive forward modelling pipeline for parameter inference. We demonstrate that jittering can mask small scale theoretical uncertainties and survey systematic effects like fibre collisions and we show that Monte Carlo subsampling can remove the effects of survey selection functions. We outline how to measure field level statistics from future surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use machine learning methods to search for parity violations in the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, motivated by recent claims of chirality detection using the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF), which would suggest new physics during the epoch of inflation. This work seeks to reproduce these claims using methods originating from high energy collider analyses. Our machine learning methods optimise some underlying parity odd function of the data, and use it to evaluate the parity odd fraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of these methods and then apply them to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogue. No parity violation is detected at any significance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from the cross-correlation of DESI Luminous Red Galaxies and $Planck$ CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the angular cross-correlation between a luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Survey data release DR9 and the $Planck$ cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps to constrain the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}$, using the scale-dependent galaxy bias effect. The galaxy sample covers approximately 40\% of the sky, contains galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 1.4$, and is calibrated with the LRG spectra that have been observed for DESI Year 1 (Y1). We apply a nonlinear imaging systematics treatment based on neural networks to remove observational effects that could potentially bias the $f_{\rm NL}$ measurement. Our measurement is performed without blinding, but the full analysis pipeline is tested with simulations including systematics. Using the two-point angular cross-correlation between LRG and CMB lensing only ($C_\ell^{\kappa G}$) we find $f_{\rm NL} = 39_{-38}^{+40}$ at 68% confidence level, and our result is robust in terms of systematics and cosmology assumptions. If we combine this information with the autocorrelation of LRG ($C_\ell^{GG}$) applying a $\ell_{\rm min}$ scale cut to limit the impact of systematics, we find $f_{\rm NL} = 24_{-21}^{+20}$ at 68% confidence level. Our results motivate the use of CMB lensing cross-correlations for measuring $f_{\rm NL}$ with future datasets given its stability in terms of observational systematics compared to the angular auto-correlation. Furthermore, performing accurate systematics mitigation is crucially important in order to achieve competitive constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ from CMB lensing cross-correlation in combination with the tracers' autocorrelation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on stochastic trees, modelling the inflationary expansion as a branching process. Combined with the $\delta N$ formalism, this allows us to generate real-space maps of the curvature perturbation that fully capture quantum diffusion and its non-perturbative backreaction during inflation. Unlike lattice methods, trees do not proceed on a fixed background since new spacetime units emerge dynamically as trees unfold, naturally incorporating metric fluctuations. The recursive structure of stochastic trees also offers remarkable numerical efficiency, and we develop the FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool and demonstrate its performance. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees, and how their mass distribution can be obtained while automatically accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" effect. In the "quantum-well" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature and discuss several prospects.</description>

Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>Sparsity covariance: a source of uncertainty when estimating correlation functions with a discrete sample of observations in the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological observables rely heavily on summary statistics such as two-point correlation functions. In many practical cases (e.g. the weak-lensing cosmic shear), those correlation functions are estimated from a finite, discrete sample of measurements that are randomly distributed in the sky. The result then inevitably depends on the sample at hand, regardless of any experimental noise. This sample dependence is a source of uncertainty for cosmological observables which I call sparsity covariance. This article proposes a mathematical definition and a generic method to compute sparsity covariance. It is then applied to the concrete case of cosmic shear, showing that sparsity covariance mostly enhances shape noise, whose amplitude is determined by the apparent ellipticity of galaxies rather than their intrinsic ellipticity. In general, sparsity covariance is non-negligible when the signal-to-noise ratio of individual measurements in the sample is comparable to, or larger than, unity.</description>

      <title>Improved null tests of $\Lambda$CDM and FLRW in light of DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DESI DR2 BAO data exclude the flat $\Lambda$CDM model at more than 2.5$\sigma$, depending on different data combinations when analyzed through the $w_0w_a$CDM parametrization. This simple parametrization may introduce bias in the results. We use null tests that probe for deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM at late times, independent of any specific dark energy parametrization. We provide several diagnostics for null tests and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we derive diagnostics that improve on previous ones, such as the popular $O_{\rm m}$ diagnostic. The diagnostics are derived from both background and perturbed quantities. Using the combination of DESI DR2 BAO and supernova data, with or without CMB data, we find that deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM are at $\sim1\sigma$ confidence level in most of the redshift range (more than 1$\sigma$ for a few small redshift intervals in a few cases). These deviations are minor for other non-DESI SDSS-IV BAO data combined with Pantheon+, with or without CMB data. Since spatial curvature can potentially modify the results, we also test for curvature in the general $\Lambda$CDM model and the general FLRW model. While there is slight evidence for nonzero cosmic curvature at lower redshifts in a general $\Lambda$CDM model, there is no statistically significant evidence in a general FLRW model.</description>

      <title>Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, suggesting evidence for a dynamic dark energy. These results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which better fit the data when they exhibit an unphysical phantom behavior in the past. In this paper, we briefly analyze how ambiguous this latter conclusion can be in light of the background degeneracy between EoS parameterizations and minimally coupled quintessence scenarios. We then investigate whether the current observational data can be accommodated with a non-phantom, thawing dark energy EoS, typical of a broad class of quintessence models. We show that the thawing behavior of this EoS outperforms the CPL parameterization and is statistically competitive with $\Lambda$CDM while predicting cosmic acceleration as a transient phenomenon. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN) and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of the evolution of dark matter in the dynamical dark matter (DDM) model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Based on CMB data, we find a very strong linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing the single-parameter DDM model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm}a$, where the $\sim2\,\sigma$ DDM evidences is well captured and even strengthened. We demonstrate that there are beyond $2\,\sigma$ evidences of the coexistence of DDM and dynamical dark energy using the combinations of CMB, DESI BAO and Pantheon+ SN data. In such models, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we verify that the universe remains in a matter-dominated state for a substantial period in the past, accelerate in the distant future and finally becomes completely dominated by dark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the universe is the ``Super Rip'' induced by dark matter with an extremely negative pressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of cosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models at $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the analysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background collected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic oscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a single parameter $R_{\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the cobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the model parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data, yielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data provides $75\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis without ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of magnitude, values in the $95\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low reheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values greater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for dust $\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more than $2\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of parameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high degree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.</description>

Abstract: We summarise the physics of first-order phase transitions in the early universe, and the possible ways in which they might come about. We then focus on gravitational waves, emphasising general qualitative features of stochastic backgrounds produced by early universe phase transitions and the cosmology of their present-day appearance. Finally, we conclude by discussing some of the ways in which a stochastic background might be detected.</description>

      <title>Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the evaporation of black holes immersed in a de Sitter environment, using the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime to model the process. The role of cosmological observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. Results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, with specific results for primordial black holes (PBHs). The timescale of evaporation is shown to depend significantly on the choice of cosmological observer, and may differ substantially from predictions based on stationary models in later times. Deviations are also shown with respect to the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are ending their evaporation process today.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of MACS J0138$-$2155, at $z=0.336$, the first galaxy cluster hosting two strongly-lensed supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, providing us with a chance to obtain a reliable $H_0$ measurement from the time delays between the multiple images. We take advantage of new data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope, covering a central $1 \rm \, arcmin^2$ of the lensing cluster, for a total depth of 3.7 hours, including 2.9 hours recently obtained by our Target of Opportunity programme. Our new spectroscopic catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 107 objects, including 50 galaxy cluster members with secure redshift values in the range $0.324 &lt; z &lt; 0.349$, and 13 lensed multiple images from four background sources between $0.767\leq z \leq 3.420$, including four images of the host galaxy of the two SNe. We exploit the MUSE data to study the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster members and two background galaxies, obtaining reliable measurements of their line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Finally, we combine these results with measurements of the total magnitude of the cluster members in the Hubble Space Telescope F160W band to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ($L \propto \sigma^{1/\alpha}$) for the early-type cluster member galaxies, measuring a slope $\alpha=0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. A pure and complete sample of cluster member galaxies and a reliable characterisation of their total mass structure are key to building accurate total mass maps of the cluster, mitigating the impact of parametric degeneracies, which is necessary for inferring the value of $H_0$ from the measured time delays between the lensed images of the two SNe.</description>

      <title>$f(T)$ Gravity: Background Dependence and Propagating Degrees of Freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, rooted in General Relativity (GR), has achieved remarkable success, yet it still faces unresolved issues like the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the Hubble tension. These challenges might imply the need for alternative gravitational theories. Teleparallel gravity offers a compelling framework by reformulating the gravitational interaction using torsion, rather than curvature, as its fundamental geometrical property. This paper delves into $f(T)$ gravity, an extension of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which introduces non-linear modifications of the torsion scalar $T$. We focus on the role of spacetime-dependent Lorentz transformations in the vierbein formalism, examining their impact on both background solutions and perturbation dynamics. Special attention is given to the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime, as well as the anisotropic Bianchi I spacetime. Furthermore, the analysis of the propagating degrees of freedom on these spacetimes is performed. While it is well established that TEGR reproduces the same results as GR, the propagating degrees of freedom in its non-linear extension, $f(T)$ gravity, is still debated in the literature. In this work, we find that only two fields propagate in the gravity sector, independently of the background spacetime considered, either FLRW or Bianchi I. Although not definitive, this paper provides fresh insights into the issue of the propagating degrees of freedom in $f(T)$ gravity, opening the door to intriguing new directions for further investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)], a baryogenesis scenario was proposed in which our visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk, giving rise to a new pseudo-scalar boson. In the present paper, one shows that this boson may survive as a relic from the early Universe, forming a minor component of dark matter. Remarkably, a one-loop process enables an ultra-weak yet non-zero coupling to photons, leading to a distinctive scattering signature. One explores this effect and argues that subtle light scattering around blue giant stars could provide observational constraints on the boson's properties, thereby testing the underlying baryogenesis scenario with current and future observation instruments.</description>

      <title>PAC in DESI. I. Galaxy Stellar Mass Function into the $10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates cosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights into galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\alpha_{\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Searches for neutrino isocurvature usually constrain a specific linear combination of isocurvature perturbations. In this work, we discuss realistic cosmological scenarios giving rise to neutrino isocurvature. We show that in general both, neutrino and matter isocurvature perturbations are generated, whose ratio we parameterize by a newly introduced mixing angle. We obtain the first limits on this new mixing angle from PLANCK data, and discuss novel insights into the early Universe that could be provided by future measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>
