      <title>Pan-tropical plant functional trait variation from space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plant functional trait variation in tropical forests is central to predicting ecosystem responses to change. Informaiton on traits is limited relative to the diversity of climate, landforms, disturbance regimes and species present. These traits are central to modeled predictions of ecosystem change. We used a new spaceborne imagining spectrometer from the Italian Space Agency to sample roughly 1% of the tropical moist forest biome for traits along the Leaf Economics Spectrum, as well as data to contrast them with adjacent biomes. we used these data to examine LES traits between tropical moist forests on three continents. Knowledge of trait variation and its environmental controls can inform models of ecosystem response in a changing environment, allowing biological detail in models of biophysical and biogeochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Rock-Paper-Scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we study a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations is encoded in a remarkably simple condition, often referred to as the ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), stating that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We show that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting times, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.</description>

      <title>Milestones at the Origin of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living organisms have some common structures, chemical reactions and molecular structures. The organisms consist of cells with cell division, they have homochirality of protein and carbohydrate units, and metabolism, and genetics, and they are mortal. The molecular structures and chemical reactions underlying these features are common from the simplest bacteria to human beings. The origin of life is evolutionary with the emergence of a network of spontaneous biochemical reactions, and the evolution has taken place over a very long time. The evolution contains, however some "landmarks" and bottlenecks, which in a revolutionary manner directed the evolution, and the article tries to establish the order of these events. The article advocates that a possible order in the emergence of life is that the first milestone in prebiotic evolution is at the emergence of homochirality in proteins. The homochirality of peptides is, however, with instability and racemization which causes aging of the peptides and mortality. The metabolism and genetics are established through homochiral enzymes in the Earth's crust for $\approx$ 4 Gyr ago. Finally, the cells with cell division are established in the Hot Springs environment at the interface between the crust and the Hadean Ocean.</description>

      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-masses for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of data analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>
