      <title>k-Planar and Fan-Crossing Drawings and Transductions of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-way connection between FO transductions (logical transformations) of planar graphs, and a certain variant of fan-crossing (fan-planar) drawings of graphs which for bounded-degree graphs essentially reduces to being k-planar for fixed k. For graph classes, this connection allows to derive non-transducibility results from nonexistence of the said drawings and, conversely, from nonexistence of a transduction to derive nonexistence of the said drawings. For example, the class of 3D-grids is not k-planar for any fixed k. We hope that this connection will help to draw a path to a possible proof that not all toroidal graphs are transducible from planar graphs.
  Our characterization can be extended to any fixed surface instead of the plane. The result is based on a very recent characterization of weakly sparse FO transductions of classes of bounded expansion by [Gajarsk\'y, G{\l}adkowski, Jedelsk\'y, Pilipczuk and Toru\'nczyk, arXiv:2505.15655].</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Design of Efficient Diversification Algorithms to NP-Hard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable recent interest in computing a diverse collection of solutions to a given optimization problem, both in the AI and theory communities. Given a classical optimization problem $\Pi$ (e.g., spanning tree, minimum cuts, maximum matching, minimum vertex cover) with input size $n$ and an integer $k\geq 1$, the goal is to generate a collection of $k$ maximally diverse solutions to $\Pi$. This diverse-X paradigm not only allows the user to generate very different solutions, but also helps make systems more secure and robust by handling uncertainty, and achieve energy efficiency.
  For problems $\Pi$ in P (such as spanning tree and minimum cut), there are efficient $\text{poly}(n,k)$ approximation algorithms available for the diverse variants [Hanaka et al. AAAI 2021, 2022, 2023, Gao et al. LATIN 2022, de Berg et al. ISAAC 2023]. In contrast, only FPT algorithms are known for NP-hard problems such as vertex covers and independent sets [Baste et al. IJCAI 2020, Eiben et al. SODA 2024, Misra et al. ISAAC 2024, Austrin et al. ICALP 2025], but in the worst case, these algorithms run in time $\exp((kn)^c)$ for some $c&gt;0$. In this work, we address this gap and give $\text{poly}(n,k)$ or $f(k)\text{poly}(n)$ time approximation algorithms for diversification variants of several NP-hard problems such as knapsack, maximum weight independent sets (MWIS) and minimum vertex covers in planar graphs, geometric (rectangle) knapsack, enclosing points by polygon, and MWIS in unit-disk-graphs of points in convex position. Our results are achieved by developing a general framework and applying it to problems with textbook dynamic-programming algorithms to find one solution.</description>

      <title>Computing Diverse and Nice Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computing diverse triangulations to a given polygon. Given a simple $n$-gon $P$, an integer $ k \geq 2 $, a quality measure $\sigma$ on the set of triangulations of $P$ and a factor $ \alpha \geq 1 $, we formulate the Diverse and Nice Triangulations (DNT) problem that asks to compute $k$ \emph{distinct} triangulations $T_1,\dots,T_k$ of $P$ such that a) their diversity, $\sum_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, is as large as possible \emph{and} b) they are nice, i.e., $\sigma(T_i) \leq \alpha \sigma^* $ for all $1\leq i \leq k$. Here, $d$ denotes the symmetric difference of edge sets of two triangulations, and $\sigma^*$ denotes the best quality of triangulations of $P$, e.g., the minimum Euclidean length.
  As our main result, we provide a $\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$-time approximation algorithm for the DNT problem that returns a collection of $k$ distinct triangulations whose diversity is at least $1 - \Theta(1/k)$ of the optimal, and each triangulation satisfies the quality constraint. This is accomplished by studying \emph{bi-criteria triangulations} (BCT), which are triangulations that simultaneously optimize two criteria, a topic of independent interest. We complement our approximation algorithms by showing that the DNT problem and the BCT problem are NP-hard.
  Finally, for the version where diversity is defined as $\min_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, we show a reduction from the problem of computing optimal Hamming codes, and provide an $n^{O(k)}$-time $\tfrac12$-approximation algorithm. This improves over the naive ${C_{n-2} \choose k} \approx 2^{O(nk)}$ time bound for enumerating all $k$-tuples among the triangulations of a simple $n$-gon, where $C_n$ denotes the $n$-th Catalan number.</description>

      <title>Discrete Microlocal Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish several results combining discrete Morse theory and microlocal sheaf theory in the setting of finite posets and simplicial complexes. Our primary tool is a computationally tractable description of the bounded derived category of sheaves on a poset with the Alexandrov topology. We prove that each bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset admits a unique (up to isomorphism of complexes) minimal injective resolution, and we provide algorithms for computing minimal injective resolution of an injective complex, as well as several useful functors between derived categories of sheaves. For the constant sheaf on a simplicial complex, we give asymptotically tight bounds on the complexity of computing the minimal injective resolution using those algorithms. Our main result is a novel definition of the discrete microsupport of a bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset. We detail several foundational properties of the discrete microsupport, as well as a microlocal generalization of the discrete homological Morse theorem and Morse inequalities.</description>
