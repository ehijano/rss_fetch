      <title>Finding low-complexity DNA sequences with longdust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Low-complexity (LC) DNA sequences are compositionally repetitive sequences that are often associated with increased variant density and variant calling artifacts. While algorithms for identifying LC sequences exist, they either lack rigorous mathematical foundation or are inefficient with long context windows.
  Results: Longdust is a new algorithm that efficiently identifies long LC sequences including centromeric satellite and tandem repeats with moderately long motifs. It defines string complexity by statistically modeling the k-mer count distribution with the parameters: the k-mer length, the context window size and a threshold on complexity. Longdust exhibits high performance on real data and high consistency with existing methods.

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Imputing Genetic Distances in Spatiotemporal Pathogen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced cases and known sequences within defined transmission chains, using time-aware evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal modeling workflows.</description>

      <title>SAGe: A Lightweight Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Mitigating the Data Preparation Bottleneck in Large-Scale Genome Sequence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome sequence analysis, which analyzes the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be decompressed and formatted first before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a new (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Thanks to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of genome sequence analysis hardware accelerators to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art decompression tools.</description>
