      <title>Quantifying topological features and irregularities in zebrafish patterns using the sweeping-plane filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex patterns emerge across a wide range of biological systems. While such patterns often exhibit remarkable robustness, variation and irregularity exist at multiple scales and can carry important information about the underlying agent interactions driving collective dynamics. Many methods for quantifying biological patterns focus on large-scale, characteristic features (such as stripe width or spot number), but questions remain on how to characterize messy patterns. In the case of cellular patterns that emerge during development or regeneration, understanding where patterns are most susceptible to variability may help shed light on cell behavior and the tissue environment. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce methods based on topological data analysis to classify and quantify messy patterns arising from agent-based interactions, by extracting meaningful biological interpretations from persistence barcode summaries. To compute persistent homology, our methods rely on a sweeping-plane filtration which, in comparison to the Vietoris--Rips filtration, is more rarely applied to biological systems. We demonstrate how results from the sweeping-plane filtration can be interpreted to quantify stripe patterns (with and without interruptions) by analyzing in silico zebrafish skin patterns, and we generate new quantitative predictions about which pattern features may be most robust or variable. Our work provides an automated framework for quantifying features and irregularities in spot and stripe patterns and highlights how different approaches to persistent homology can provide complementary insight into biological systems.</description>

      <title>An Alignment-Free Explanation for Collective Predator Evasion in Moving Animal Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving animal groups consist of many distinct individuals but can operate and function as one unit when performing different tasks. Effectively evading unexpected predator attacks is one primary task for many moving groups. The current explanation for predator evasion responses in moving animal groups require the individuals in the groups interact via (velocity) alignment. However, experiments have shown that some animals do not use alignment. This suggests that another explanation for the predator evasion capacity in at least these species is needed. Here we establish that effective collective predator evasion does not require alignment, it can be induced via attraction and repulsion alone. We also show that speed differences between individuals that have directly observed the predator and those that have not influence evasion success and the speed of the collective evasion process, but are not required to induce the phenomenon. Our work here adds collective predator evasion to a number of phenomena previously thought to require alignment interactions that have recently been shown to emerge from attraction and repulsion alone. Based on our findings we suggest experiments and make predictions that may lead to a deeper understanding of not only collective predator evasion, but also collective motion in general.</description>

      <title>Introduction to a Low-Cost AI-Powered GUI for Unstained Cell Culture Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.</description>

      <title>Neural networks for learning macroscopic chemotactic sensitivity from microscopic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic (population-level) dynamics of chemotactic cell movement -- arising from underlying microscopic (individual-based) models -- are often described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the spatio-temporal evolution of cell concentrations. In certain cases, these macroscopic PDEs can be analytically derived from microscopic models, thereby elucidating the dependence of PDE coefficients on the parameters of the underlying individual-based dynamics. However, such analytical derivations are not always feasible, particularly for more complex or nonlinear microscopic models. In these instances, neural networks offer a promising alternative for estimating the coefficients of macroscopic PDEs directly from data generated by microscopic simulations. In this work, three microscopic models of chemotaxis are investigated. The macroscopic chemotaxis sensitivity is estimated using neural networks, thereby bridging the gap between individual-level behaviours and population-level descriptions. The results are compared with macroscopic PDEs, which can be derived for each model in certain parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>MIDOG 2025 Track 2: A Deep Learning Model for Classification of Atypical and Normal Mitotic Figures under Class and Hardness Imbalances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Accurate classification of mitotic figures into normal and atypical types is crucial for tumor prognostication in digital pathology. However, developing robust deep learning models for this task is challenging due to the subtle morphological differences, as well as significant class and hardness imbalances in real-world histopathology datasets. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning approach based on a ResNet backbone with specialized classification heads. Our architecture uniquely models both the mitotic figure phenotype and the instance difficulty simultaneously. This method is specifically designed to handle the challenges of diverse tissue types, scanner variability, and imbalanced data. We employed focal loss to effectively mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505 +/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/- 0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the potential to support precise prognostic assessments in clinical practice and improve consistency in pathological diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Drug Repurposing Using Deep Embedded Clustering and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs; however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data. Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Additive Modeling of TRPM4-Ribo Transcriptional Space in Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. In this study, generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to model the relationship between TRPM4 and genes shortlisted using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter in aggressive PCa and benign prostate (BP) control cells derived from scRNA-seq dataset. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, and RPS26; averaged into Ribo as the gene set), passed the dual-filter specifically in PCa cells. GAM modeling of TRPM4-Ribo significantly outperformed TRPM4 modeling with alternative cancer gene sets (GSK-3B, mTOR, NF-KB, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt). Cell explanatory power (CEP) classification was devised and verified by cross-validation to identify individual PCa cells most well-predicted by the model. CEP classification binarized PCa cells into top-ranked explanatory power (TREP; more well-predicted by the model) and non-TREP cells. In TRPM4-Ribo GAM plots, distribution pattern of TREP cells shifted at an inflection point (IP) i.e., the specific TRPM4 expression value that further binarized the plot into pre-IP (TRPM4 values below IP) and post-IP (TRPM4 values above IP) regions, producing a quadrant of TREP versus non-TREP cells for each PCa patient. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related GOs, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion GOs. In conclusion, the CEP-IP framework based on pairwise genes produces quadrants of cancer cell subpopulations, enabling the identification of distinctive biology with potential therapeutic implications.</description>

      <title>A Reanalysis of the FDA's Benefit-Risk Assessment of Moderna's mRNA-1273 COVID Vaccine: For 18-25-Year-Old Males, Risks Exceeded Benefits Relative to Hospitalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FDA conducted a benefit-risk assessment for Moderna's COVID vaccine mRNA-1273 prior to its full approval, announced 1/31/2022. The FDA focused its assessment on males of ages 18-64 years because the agency's risk analysis was limited to vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis (VAM/P) given the excess risk among males. The FDA analysis concluded that vaccine benefits clearly outweighed risks, even for 18-25-year-old males (those at highest VAM/P risk). We reanalyze the FDA benefit-risk assessment using information available through the third week of January 2022 and focusing on 18-25-year-old males. We use the FDA's framework but extend its model by accounting for protection derived from prior COVID infection, finer age-stratification in COVID-hospitalization rates, and incidental hospitalizations (those of patients who test positive for COVID but are being treated for something else). We also use more realistic projections of Omicron-infection rates and more accurate rates of VAM/P. With hospitalizations as the principal endpoint of the analysis (those prevented by vaccination vs. those caused by VAM/P), our model finds vaccine risks outweighed benefits for 18-25-year-old males, except in scenarios projecting implausibly high Omicron-infection prevalence. Our assessment suggests that mRNA-1273 vaccination of 18-25-year-old males generated between 16% and 63% more hospitalizations from vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis alone compared to COVID hospitalizations prevented (over a 5-month period of vaccine protection assumed by the FDA). The preceding assessment is based on assumptions drawn from data available before 1/22/22. Moreover, these assumptions are validated by subsequently available data. Thus, we show that the outcome of a benefit-risk assessment for vaccination may be dramatically impacted by accounting for the benefits derived from prior infection</description>

      <title>A DNA-Centric Mechanism for Protein Targeting in 6mA Methylation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How DNA-binding proteins locate specific genomic targets remains a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional protein-centric approaches, which rely on wet-lab experiments and visualization techniques, often lack genome-wide resolution and fail to capture physiological dynamics in living cells. Here, we introduce a DNA-centric strategy that leverages in vivo N6-methyladenine (6mA) data to decode the logic of protein-DNA recognition. By integrating linguistically inspired modeling with machine learning, we reveal two distinct search modes: a protein-driven diffusion mechanism and a DNA sequence-driven mechanism, wherein specific motifs function as protein traps. We further reconstruct high-resolution interaction landscapes at the level of individual sequences and trace the evolutionary trajectories of recognition motifs across species. This framework addresses fundamental limitations of protein-centered approaches and positions DNA itself as an intrinsic reporter of protein-binding behavior.</description>

      <title>Cockroaches use diverse strategies to self-right on the ground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.00421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial animals often must self-right from an upside-down orientation on the ground to survive. Here, we compared self-righting strategies of the Madagascar hissing, American, and discoid cockroaches on a challenging flat, rigid, low-friction surface to quantify the mechanical principles. All three species almost always self-righted (97% probability) when given time (30 seconds), frequently self-righted (63%) on the first attempt, and on that attempt did so in one second or less. When successful, two of the three species gained and used pitch and/or roll rotational kinetic energy to overcome potential energy barriers (American 63% of all attempts and discoid 78%). By contrast, the largest, heaviest, wingless cockroach (Madagascar hissing) relied far less on the energy of motion and was the slowest to self-right. Two of the three species used rolling strategies to overcome low potential energy barriers. Successful righting attempts had greater rolling rotation than failed attempts as the center of mass rose to the highest position. Madagascar hissing cockroaches rolled using body deformation (98% of all trials) and the American cockroach relied on leg forces (93%). By contrast, the discoid cockroach overcame higher and a wider range of potential energy barriers with simultaneous pitching and rolling using wings (46% of all trials) and legs (49%) equally to self-right. Our quantification revealed the performance advantages of using rotational kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy barrier and rolling more to lower it, while maintaining diverse strategies for ground-based self-righting.</description>

      <title>Snakes partition their body to traverse large steps stably</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.01240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many snakes live in deserts, forests, and river valleys and traverse challenging 3-D terrain like rocks, felled trees, and rubble, with obstacles as large as themselves and variable surface properties. By contrast, apart from branch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming, and gliding, laboratory studies of snake locomotion focused on that on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to understand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we study how the variable kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface friction and step height (up to 30% snout-vent length). The snake traversed by partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body sections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces for propulsion, while the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical plane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to increase in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of reduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off became closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed the snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before reaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may be generally useful for diverse, complex 3-D terrain.</description>

      <title>Terradynamically streamlined shapes in animals and robots enhances traversability through densely cluttered terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.01797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many animals, modern aircraft, and underwater vehicles use streamlined body shapes that reduce fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in air and water. Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the distributions of protein structure classes (or folding types) of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database (SCOP) are modeled precisely with geometric constructs such as convex polytopes in high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which is superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift a descriptive 'distribution model' of experimental data is de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, a possible future predictive 'domain model' generalizable to proteins in the same class for which 3D structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study furnish complete and precise information on their size and relative disposition in the high-dimensional space (vis-\`a-vis any overlaps leading to ambiguity and classification limits). Intended primarily as an accurate and summary description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, and suitably as a basis for predictive modeling where possible, the results suggest that pen-ultimately they may be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based protein structure predictions and contribute to theoretical and fundamental understanding of secondary structure formation and protein folding, demonstrating the role of high dimensional amino acid composition space in protein studies.</description>

      <title>Ising energy model for the stochastic prediction of tumor islets</title>

Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.</description>

      <title>Canonicalization of the E value from BLAST similarity search -- dissimilarity measure and distance function for a metric space of protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus itself an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.</description>
