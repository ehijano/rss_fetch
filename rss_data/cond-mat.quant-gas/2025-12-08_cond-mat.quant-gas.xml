      <title>Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Couplings on the Stability of Topological FFLO Phases in 1D Fermi Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stabilization of topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phases, with a specific emphasis on the intraband FFLO phase, in a one-dimensional (1D) Fermi gas subjected to an external magnetic field. This research highlights the crucial role of the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (DSOC). Employing a Fermi-Hubbard model alongside the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we examine the combined effects of RSOC and DSOC on these exotic superfluid phases, taking into account attractive fermionic interactions. Our principal finding reveals that while RSOC primarily stabilizes conventional zero-momentum pairing, DSOC performs a distinct and crucial role in selectively stabilizing the intraband FFLO phase. This stabilization is achieved by enhancing spin polarization within a single helicity band and suppressing interband coherence, thereby facilitating the formation of finite-momentum FFLO pairs within the same band and resulting in the emergence of a topologically nontrivial superfluid. This targeted control of intraband FFLO pairing paves the way for new strategies in the manipulation of superfluid phases in spin-orbit coupled systems and offers essential insights for experimental realizations in ultracold atomic gases, with implications for topological quantum computing and Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>The deep Hilbert space of all-to-all interacting SU(3) atoms: from quantum to classical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of chaos in multilevel atoms with all-to-all interactions, inspired by cavity QED. Focusing on a 3-level Tavis-Cummings model in a far detuned limit, we detail its deep Hilbert space structure -- i.e. we enumerate all distinct dynamical sectors, beyond the totally symmetric subspace -- by using the Schur-Weyl duality, which is applicable thanks to the permutation symmetry in the all-to-all Hamiltonian. Strong Hilbert space fragmentation ensues from the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with some sectors displaying regular dynamics and others being chaotic. We uncover that many permutation symmetry sectors contribute to the dynamics in the classical limit, in addition to the commonly studied totally symmetric subspace. To elucidate the dynamical responses in each of the symmetry sectors, we propose a semiclassical description in terms of spin coherent states, which is also able to explain the origin of chaotic or regular dynamics with a simple geometrical argument. Our work contributes to the study of the quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems, and uncovers a rich structure in multilevel all-to-all interacting models.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</description>

      <title>Vortex Mass in Superfluid Fermi Gases along the BEC-BCS Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex mass is a key concept in the study of superfluid dynamics, referring to the inertia of vortices in a superfluid, which affects their motion and behavior. Despite being an important quantity, the vortex mass has never been observed experimentally, and remains an unresolved issue in this field. As of now, a large body of research assumes that the vortex mass is a local parameter. In contrast, we present a calculation that suggests a logarithmic dependence on the system size, agreeing with some earlier predictions in the context of Bose gases. We analyze the problem using an effective field theory that describes ultracold atomic Fermi gases over the BEC-BCS crossover at both zero and nonzero temperatures. Our study reveals a strong dependence of the vortex mass on the scattering length; in particular, the vortex mass grows rapidly when moving towards the BCS side. Furthermore, we find that the system-size dependence of the vortex mass results in values an order of magnitude larger than those predicted by other models for realistic system sizes. This implies that the vortex mass could be observable in a wider parameter range than was previously expected. This is particularly relevant considering recent advances in experimental techniques that place the observation of vortex mass in superfluid Fermi gases within reach.</description>

      <title>Robust, Fast, and efficient formation of stable tetraatomic molecules from ultracold atoms via generalized stimulated Raman exact passage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>

      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. Finally, our analytical results are confronted with extensive molecular dynamics simulations, which interestingly show the existence of decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystalline phases in regions of the phase diagram that exhibit a high degree of frustration. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>
