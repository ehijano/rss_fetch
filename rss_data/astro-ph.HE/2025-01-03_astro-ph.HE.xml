      <title>Hunting for the candidates of Changing-Look Blazar using Mclust Clustering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The changing-look blazars (CLBs) are the blazars that their optical spectral lines at different epochs show a significant changes and present a clear transition between the standard FSRQ and BL Lac types. The changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of the state transition in the accretion process of the supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are 8 physical properties parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and those of BL Lacs. In order to search more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the $mclust$ Gaussian Mixture Modelling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for the 255 subsets of the 8 physical properties parameters with 2250 blazars from the 4FGL-DR3. We find that there are 29 subsets with 3 groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are 4 subsets with the adjusted Rand index greater then 0.610 (ARI $&gt;$ 0.610). The combined clustering results from 4 subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs that includes 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, where 11 CLBCs labeled as BL Lac and 56 CLBCs labeled as FSRQ in 4FGL catalog.</description>

      <title>On the Duration of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a short-duration GRB with supernova association (GRB 200826A) and two long-duration GRBs with kilonova associations (GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) have been detected, which demolished the hope for a tidy connection between GRB duration and their progenitor systems. Here I summarize various physical factors that can shape the duration of a GRB and propose that the duration of a GRB can be defined by four factors: progentor, central engine, emitter, and geometry. The progenitor-defined duration is only relevant when the central engine is powered by accretion and when the modifications by other factors are not important. The untidy situation of duration - progenitor mismatches suggests that other factors likely play important roles in defining GRB duration at least in some GRBs. In particular, a GRB may not be powered by accretion but rather by a millisecond magnetar at least for some GRBs. The complicated lightcurve of GRB 211211A suggests both progenitor- and engine-defined durations, which may require a new type of progenitor system involving a white dwarf - neutron star merger with a magnetar merger product. The single broad pulse lightcurve with well-behaved energy-dependent behavior of GRB 230307A suggests an emitter-defined long duration. The central engine timescale may be short enough to be accommodated within the framework of a standard binary neutron star merger. Its spiky lightcurve with fast variability as well as extended X-ray emission suggest the existence of mini-jets in the global dissipation region, powered by an underlying magnetar.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT Discovery of a Gamma-ray Outburst from the Peculiar Compact Steep Spectrum Radiogalaxy 3C 216</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3C 216 is an extra-galactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in November 2022, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in May 2023. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, suggesting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results support the interpretation of the gamma-ray emission within a single zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, with important implications for the mechanisms powering high-energy radiation in AGN jets.</description>

      <title>Role of gravitational decoupling on theoretical insights of relativistic massive compact stars in the mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in theoretical simulations of mass gap objects, particularly those resulting from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of measuring neutron star radii. In the light of this, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of compact objects (CSs), revealing that while the distribution of black hole masses varies based on formation mechanisms, they frequently cluster around specific values. For instance, the masses observed in GW190814 $(23.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0} \, M_{\odot})$ and GW200210 $(24.1^{+7.5}_{-4.6} M_{\odot})$ exemplify this clustering. We employed the gravitational decoupling approach within the framework of standard general relativity and thus focusing on the strange star model. This model highlights the effects of deformation adjusted by the decoupling constant and the bag function. By analyzing the mass-radius limits of mass gap objects from neutron star mergers and massive pulsars, we can effectively constrain the free parameters in our model, allowing us to predict the radii and moments of inertia for these objects. The mass-radius ($M-R$) and mass-inertia ($M-I$) profiles demonstrate the robustness of our models. It is shown that as the decoupling constant $\beta$ increases from 0 to 0.1 and the bag constant $\mathcal{B}_g$ decreases from 70 $MeV/fm^3$ to 55 $MeV/fm^3$, the maximum mass reaches $M_{max} = 2.87 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 11.20 km. In contrast, for $\beta = 0$, the maximum mass is $M_{max} = 2.48 \, M_\odot$ with a radius of 10.69 km. Similarly, it has been exhibited that as $\beta$ decreases to 0, the maximum mass peaks at $M_{max} = 2.95 M_\odot$ for $\mathcal{B}_g = 55 MeV/fm^3$ with a radius of 11.32 km. These results not only exceed the observed masses of CSs but also correlate with recent findings from gravitational wave events like GW190814 and GW200210.</description>

      <title>The Role of Electric Dominance for Particle Injection in Relativistic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas -- where the magnetization $\sigma\gg1$ -- is regarded as an efficient particle accelerator, capable of explaining the most dramatic astrophysical flares. We employ two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic pair-plasma reconnection with vanishing guide field and outflow boundaries to quantify the impact of the energy gain occurring in regions of electric dominance ($E&gt;B$) for the early stages of particle acceleration (i.e., the ``injection'' stage). We calculate the mean fractional contribution $\zeta(\epsilon^\ast,\epsilon_{\rm T}$) by $E&gt;B$ fields to particle energization up to the injection threshold energy, $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$; here, $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is the particle energy at time $T$. We find that $\zeta$ monotonically increases with $\sigma$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}$; for $\sigma\gtrsim 50$ and $\epsilon_{\rm T}/\sigma\gtrsim 8$, we find that $\gtrsim 80\%$ of the energy gain obtained before reaching $\epsilon^\ast=\sigma/4$ occurs in $E&gt;B$ regions. We find that $\zeta$ is independent of simulation box size $L_x$, as long as $\epsilon_{\rm T}$ is normalized to the maximum particle energy, which scales as $\epsilon_{\rm max}\propto L_{\rm x}^{1/2}$ in 2D. The distribution of energy gains $\epsilon_{\chi}$ acquired in $E&gt;B$ regions can be modeled as $dN/d\epsilon_{\chi}\propto\epsilon_{\chi}^{-0.35}\exp[-(\epsilon_{\chi}/0.06\,\sigma)^{0.5}]$. Our results help assess the role of electric dominance in relativistic reconnection with vanishing guide fields, which may be realized in the magnetospheres of black holes and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>On the population of electron-positron pairs in the magnetosphere of SgrA*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we consider the possibility of the Schwinger pair creation driven by the centrifugal mechanism in the magnetosphere of SgrA*. In particular, it is shown that the magneto-centrifugal effects become extremely efficient due to the vortex driven magnetic field, which is by several orders of magnitude bigger than previously thought. Dynamics of the magneto-centrifugally accelerated charged particles leads to charge-separation, parametrically inducing the Langmuir waves. The corresponding electric field exponentially amplifies and after reaching the Schwinger threshold, the efficient pair production occurs, that is eventually saturated by the annihilation process.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for Long-Term Trends in Fermi-LAT Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of time scales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN lightcurves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning $\approx$10\, years, utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Scalar, Vector Perturbations and Effective Hawking Radiation of Cylindrical Black Holes in $f(\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates scalar perturbations and quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with cylindrical black holes constructed within the frameworks of $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity and Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) gravity. Moreover, we study the modified Hawking radiation in these black hole solutions and analyze the effects of coupling constants. These modified theories, which extend general relativity by introducing higher-order curvature corrections and additional geometric terms, provide a rich platform for exploring deviations from standard gravitational physics. The study begins by revisiting the cylindrical black holes in these modified gravity theories, where the effective cosmological constants respectively, are represented by $\Lambda_m^{f(\mathcal{R})}$ and $\Lambda_m^{\mathcal{RI}}$ related to the coupling constants unique to each framework. Afterwards, the QNMs, intrinsic damped oscillations of the black hole space-time, are analyzed to probe the stability of the system, with the effective potential $V$ revealing the impact of the modified gravity parameters. Additionally, the thermodynamic properties of the black holes are examined through the lens of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation. The GUP-modified Hawking temperature and entropy are derived, demonstrating significant deviations from classical results and highlighting the quantum gravitational effects in these modified frameworks. By linking QNMs, thermodynamics, and quantum corrections, this work not only deepens the understanding of modified gravity theories but also offers potential observational pathways to test their validity.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EoS constraints within a nonlocal color superconducting quark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 - 2.22~M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>

Abstract: The concept of electromotive field appears in various applications in space and astrophysical plasmas. A review is given on the electromotive field highlighting our current understanding of the theoretical picture and the spacecraft observations in interplanetary space. The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence. Applications to astrophysical cases (Earth magnetosphere, heliospheric shocks, interstellar medium, and relativistic jets) are also briefly introduced, as well.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations.

      <title>Testing the extended corona model with the optical/UV reverberation mapping of the accretion disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The illumination of the accretion disks is frequently studied assuming that the incident X-ray flux is a point-like source. The approach is referred as lamppost model.The most recent computations of the X-ray reprocessing by the disk take into account the departure from the simple lamppost models. However, in computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission in the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed. We test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are sensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates from a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a simple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk simultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting predictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an intermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the deviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of 20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8 M_{\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$. The maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\sim3$. When simulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the same black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable differences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups. Larger black hole mass and considerably lower Eddington ratio would allow to see larger differences between a single lamppost and a two-lampost model. UV/optical reverberation mapping is not very sensitive to the vertical extension of the corona.</description>

      <title>Impact of QCD sum rules coupling constants on neutron stars structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation on the structure of neutron stars, incorporating the presence of hyperons within a relativistic model under the mean-field approximation. Employing coupling constants derived from QCD sum rules, we explore the particle fraction in beta equilibrium and establish the mass-radius relationship for neutron stars with hyperonic matter. Additionally, we compute the stellar Love number ($\mathcal{K}_{2}$) and the tidal deformability parameter ($\varLambda$), providing valuable insights into the dynamical properties of these celestial objects. Through comparison with theoretical predictions and observational data, our results exhibit good agreement, affirming the validity of our approach. These findings contribute significantly to refining the understanding of neutron star physics, particularly in environments containing hyperons, and offer essential constraints on the equation of state governing such extreme astrophysical conditions.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Quantum Gravity via Kerr Black Hole and EHT Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a study on optical properties and shadow of quantum Schwarzschild black hole appeared in [Ye et al., Phys. Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] for a fixed Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following the same approach, we considered its rotating counterpart which is precisely a deformed Kerr metric in Loop Quantum Gravity. The deviation between the quantum-corrected Kerr and Kerr black holes has been investigated by the analysis of horizon structure and null geodesics by assuming a fixed value of $\gamma$. We have proved a theorem dealing with the location of unstable circular null orbits for all metrics of this kind by incorporating the convexity of effective potential of the Kerr black hole. The deviation between the shadows of the quantum-corrected and Kerr black holes has also been studied, and lastly the shadow analysis is incorporated in comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. We have found that the quantum correction significantly reduces the extremal spin value and hence the size of the black hole as compared to Kerr black hole. Moreover, the unstable null orbits for quantum black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. Lastly, we found that the quantum correction allows the deformed Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum-corrected Kerr black hole barely mimics M87*.</description>

      <title>Multi-Observatory Study of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): No Evidence For Abnormally Strong Stellar Magnetic Fields After Powerful X-ray Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the empirical power-law relationship between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and total surface magnetic flux (Phi), established across solar magnetic elements, time- and disk-averaged emission from the Sun, older active stars, and pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of non-flaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the Lx-Phi law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfven wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman-Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.</description>

Abstract: We present the first simulations of core-collapse supernovae in axial symmetry with feedback from fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC). Our schematic treatment of FFCs assumes instantaneous flavor equilibration under the constraint of lepton-number conservation individually for each flavor. Systematically varying the spatial domain where FFCs are assumed to occur, we find that they facilitate SN explosions in low-mass (9-12 solar masses) progenitors that otherwise explode with longer time delays, whereas FFCs weaken the tendency to explode of higher-mass (around 20 solar masses) progenitors.</description>

      <title>GECAM Observations of the Galactic Magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during the 2021 and 2022 Burst Active Episodes. I. Burst Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetar is a neutron star with an ultrahigh magnetic field ($\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G). The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 is not only one of the most active magnetars detected so far, but also the unique confirmed source of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is dedicated to monitor gamma-ray transients all over the sky, including magnetar short bursts. Here we report the GECAM observations of the burst activity of SGR J1935+2154 from January 2021 to December 2022, which results in a unique and valuable data set for this important magnetar. With a targeted search of GECAM data, 159 bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are detected by GECAM-B while 97 bursts by GECAM-C, including the X-ray burst associated with a bright radio burst. We find that both the burst duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow lognormal distributions. The period of burst activity is $134\pm20$ days, thus the burst activity could be generally divided into four active episodes over these two years. Interestingly, the hardness ratio of X-ray bursts tends to be softer during these two years, especially during the active episode with radio bursts detected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book chapter explores key aspects of neutron stars, pulsar glitches, tidal deformability, fast pulsars, the equation of state, and strange quark matter stars. Challenges in directly measuring neutron star radius have led to reliance on spectroscopic and timing techniques, with uncertainties addressed through careful source selection and theoretical modeling. Pulsar glitches reveal insights into the equation of state through angular momentum transfer within the neutron star. Tidal deformability is crucial in gravitational-wave astronomy, exemplified by the GW170817 event. Fast pulsars, instrumental in astrophysical testing, are classified into ordinary pulsars, millisecond pulsars, and magnetars. The EOS is vital for understanding neutron star internal structure, explored through various models. The chapter delves into the theoretical framework for rotating neutron stars, addressing uniform and differential rotation scenarios and their impacts on mass and radius. Additionally, the intriguing concept of quark stars and strange dwarfs is investigated. The various topics discussed in this book chapter contribute to a broader understanding of dense matter physics, astrophysical phenomena, and the potential for transformative discoveries through advanced observational techniques and technologies like gravitational wave detectors, radio telescopes, and X-ray telescopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from accreting supermassive black holes at cosmological distances can be powerful emitters of $\gamma$-rays. However, the precise mechanisms and locations responsible for the dissipation of energy within these jets, leading to observable $\gamma$-ray radiation, remain elusive. We detect evidence for an intrinsic absorption feature in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum at energies exceeding $10\,$GeV, presumably due to the photon-photon pair production of $\gamma$-rays with low ionization lines at the outer edge of Broad-line region (BLR), during the high-flux state of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1424$-$418. The feature can be discriminated from the turnover at higher energies resulting from $\gamma$-ray absorption in the extragalactic background light. It is absent in the low-flux states supporting the interpretation that powerful dissipation events within or at the edge of the BLR evolve into fainter $\gamma$-ray emitting zones outside the BLR, possibly associated with the moving VLBI radio knots. The inferred location of $\gamma$-ray emission zone is consistent with the observed variability time scale of the brightest flare, provided that the flare is attributed to external Compton scattering with BLR photons.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of the pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic field on the radiation pattern of giant black holes. In particular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we studied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>The Unknowns of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background Hinder New Physics Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos traveling over cosmic distances are ideal probes of new physics. We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\tau/m \sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.</description>

      <title>A Classifier-Based Approach to Multi-Class Anomaly Detection for Astronomical Transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients, with modern survey telescopes generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, Multi-Class Isolation Forests (\texttt{MCIF}), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from its latent space representation. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation and helps the neural network handle irregular sampling and model inter-passband relationships. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations matching the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method discovered $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>The coherent magnetic field of the Milky Way halo, Local Bubble and Fan Region</title>

Abstract: Recent catalog of Faraday rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic sources together with the synchrotron polarization data from WMAP and Planck provides us with a wealth of information on magnetic fields of the Galaxy. However, the integral character of these observables together with our position inside the Galaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF) complicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of the GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field of the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside the thin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and polarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of errors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is uniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account individual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations in the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease of the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model content. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data. We found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the RM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked out. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to previous approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble our model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time we showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The pitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20 degrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of the arms inferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.</description>

Abstract: We present Vela, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela focusing on the narrowband paradigm.</description>
