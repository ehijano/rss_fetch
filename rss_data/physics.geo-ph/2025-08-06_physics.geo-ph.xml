      <title>Geomorphometric atlas of ice-free Antarctic areas: Problem statement, concept, and key principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we rationalize the need to develop a geomorphometric atlas of ice-free Antarctic areas. Geomorphometric mapping of such landscapes is necessary to obtain new knowledge about quantitative topographic characteristics of these unique objects and the further use of morphometric information in the geosciences. First, we present a concept, structure, and content of the atlas including a list of 194 areas to be modeled and mapped. For each area, the atlas will include the following materials: (a) a hypsometric map; (b) a map series of the eleven morphometric variables: slope, aspect, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, catchment area, topographic wetness index, stream power index, total insolation, and wind exposition index; and (c) reference texts and tables. Second, we describe data and methods of geomorphometric modeling and mapping to be utilized for creating the atlas. Fragments of the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica will be used as input data for geomorphometric calculations and modeling. Next, we discuss specificity of the ice-free areas posing challenges in the atlas development. Finally, we consider possible applications of the derived maps. The principal feature and novelty of the atlas will be the system view on maps of key fundamental morphometric attributes associated with the theory of the topographic surface and the concept of general geomorphometry. The atlas will concentrate multi-scale, multi-aspect quantitative information on the ice-free Antarctic topography, will present it in a systematized, organized, and easy-to-read form as well as will provide scientific and information support for research in Antarctica.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic sensing of the mechanical fingerprint of reactive transport in rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mineral carbon storage in rock formations has gained significant interest in recent years. In principle, changes in mechanical rock properties driven by carbon mineralization could be quantified using seismic methods, opening the door toward field monitoring of (the progress of) carbon storage. However, these changes may vary spatially within a rock mass when reactive transport occurs. In this vein, full-field ultrasonic characterization of reacted specimens can help shed light on the process. We use a 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer to perform full-field monitoring of one-dimensional (1D) ultrasonic waves in rod-shaped sandstone specimens exposed to NaCl-rich fluid. Our initial experiments were conducted on intact sandstone specimens with high aspect ratio (length/diameter $\simeq 15$) to cater for 1D axial wave propagation. To investigate the evolution of the Young's modulus and attenuation of rock due to reactive transport, we exposed the specimens to an under-saturated NaCl solution, achieving supersaturation -- and so mineralization -- through evaporation. The upward movement of the fluid, supplied at the bottom of each specimen, was achieved through capillary action. We deploy an elastography-type approach to back-analysis, known as modified-error-in-constitutive-relation (MECR) approach, to expose the spatially-heterogeneous evolution of mechanical rock properties due to reactive transport. Our results consistently demonstrate (i) degradation of the Young's modulus, and (ii) increase in attenuation due to mineralization. To better understand the root causes of these changes, we made use of the X-ray micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of selected cross-sections. The grain-scale information suggests that microcracking (resp. pore filling) is predominantly (resp. partly) responsible for the observed macroscopic changes.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Magnetotelluric Data using Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotelluric (MT) inversion is a key technique in geophysics for imaging deep subsurface resistivity structures. However, the inherent ill-posedness and non-uniqueness of inverse problems make them challenging to solve. While supervised deep learning approaches have shown promise in this domain, their predictions are typically deterministic and fail to capture the associated uncertainty, an essential factor for decision-making. To address this limitation, we explore the application of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for MT inversion with uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we train a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) on a synthetically generated MT dataset. The BCNN effectively recovers resistivity profiles from apparent resistivity data, with the predicted means closely matching the ground truth across both the training and test sets, while also providing uncertainty estimates quantified within 3 standard deviations from the mean. These results underscore the potential of BNNs to enhance deep learning-based geophysical inversion frameworks by incorporating principled uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Algorithms for Transplanting Accelerometer Observations in Future Satellite Gravimetry Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of Earth's gravity field is essential for tracking mass redistribution processes linked to climate variability, hydrological cycles, and geodynamic phenomena. While the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions have set the benchmark for satellite gravimetry using low-low satellite to satellite tracking (LL-SST), the precision of gravity field recovery still strongly depends on the quality of accelerometer (ACC) performance and the continuity of ACC data. Traditional electrostatic accelerometers (EA) face limitations that can hinder mission outcomes, prompting exploration of advanced sensor technologies and data recovery techniques. This study presents a systematic evaluation of accelerometer data transplantation using novel accelerometer configurations, including Cold Atom Interferometry (CAI) accelerometers and hybrid EA-CAI setups, and applying both analytical and machine learning-based methods. Using comprehensive closed-loop LL-SST simulations, we compare four scenarios ranging from the conventional EA-only setup to ideal dual hybrid configurations, with a particular focus on the performance of transplant-based approaches using different neural network approaches. Our results show that the dual hybrid configuration provides the most accurate gravity field retrieval. However, the transplant-based hybrid setup, especially when supported by machine learning, emerges as a robust and cost-effective alternative, achieving comparable performance with minimal extra hardware. These findings highlight the promise of combining quantum sensor technology and data-driven transplantation for future satellite gravimetry missions, paving the way for improved global monitoring of Earth's dynamic gravity field.</description>

      <title>Investigating a Characteristic Time Lag in the Ionospheric F-region's Response to Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray and EUV solar flare emission cause increases in the Earth's dayside ionospheric electron density. While the response of the lower ionosphere to X-rays is well studied, the delay between EUV flare emission and the response of the ionospheric F-region has not been investigated. Here, we calculate the delays between incident He II 304 Angstrom emission, and the TEC response for 10 powerful solar flares, all of which exhibit delays under 1 minute. We assess these delays in relation to multiple solar and geophysical factors, and find a strong negative correlation (-0.85) between delay and He II flux change and a moderate negative correlation (-0.55) with rate of increase in He II flux. Additionally, flare magnitude and the X-ray-to-He II flux ratio at peak He II emission show strong negative correlations (-0.80 and -0.75, respectively). We also identify longer delays for flares occurring closer to the summer solstice. These results may have applications in upper-ionospheric recombination rate calculations, atmospheric modelling, and other solar-terrestrial studies. We highlight the importance of incident EUV and X-ray flux parameters on the response time of the ionospheric electron content, and these findings may also have implications for mitigating disruptions in communication and navigation systems.</description>
