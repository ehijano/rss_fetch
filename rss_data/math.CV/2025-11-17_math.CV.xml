      <title>Differential Operators, Multiple Schwarz Functions, and the Bohr Radius of Stable Harmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Bohr phenomenon for differential operators $D$ and $\mathscr{D}$ of stable harmonic mappings involving multiple Schwarz functions in $\mathcal{B}_n$, using distance formulations. By constructing suitable combinations of multiple Schwarz functions, we establish sharp and improved Bohr-type inequalities for these mappings. The corresponding Bohr radii are also determined for certain subclasses of stable harmonic functions and their associated differential operators. Moreover, Bohr-Rogosinski-type inequalities are derived, which highlights the influence of multiple Schwarz functions on the geometric properties of stable harmonic mappings. All the radii are determined, and we prove that each one is the best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth, open, oriented surface $X$ endowed with a family of complex structures $\{J_b\}_{b\in B}$ depending continuously on the parameter $b$ in a metrisable space $B$, we construct a continuous family of proper holomorphic maps $F_{b}:(X,J_b)\to\mathbb C^{2}$, $b\in B$.</description>

      <title>Properties of Holomorphic $p$-Contact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of compact holomorphic $p$-contact manifolds $X$ that we introduced recently by expanding the discussion to include non-K\"ahler hyperbolicity issues and a differential calculus based on what we call the Lie derivative with respect to a $(0,\,q)$-form with values in the holomorphic tangent bundle of $X$. We also propose the notion of $p$-contact deformations for which we prove a Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov-type unobstructedness theorem to order two. This kind of small deformations of the complex structure is related to the essential horizontal deformations that we introduced in our previous work and forms part of a wider on-going project aimed at developing a non-K\"ahler mirror symmetry theory that was first tested on the Iwasawa manifold and subsequently on Calabi-Yau page-$1$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Discrete Contact Angles and Electric Field Singularity in Electrowetting: A Multi-Scale Complex Potential Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study constructed a multi-scale theoretical framework to resolve the electric field singularity at the Triple Contact Point in electrowetting. Utilizing conformal transformation and complex analysis, we established the structure for both the global potential and local field solutions, complementing the analysis with numerical methods. Our primary finding is that the contact angle $\theta$ is not continuously adjustable but is restricted to a discrete set of values, constrained by the characteristic exponent $\lambda$. Analysis of the complex potential established $\text{Re}[\lambda] \ge 1$ as the critical condition for a non-singular electric field; conversely, singular solutions ($\text{Re}[\lambda] &lt; 1$) are localized exclusively in the acute-angle regime ($\theta &lt; \pi/2$). The high-order solution region exhibits a degeneracy phenomenon at specific angles, implying the local field structure is geometrically stable and universally applicable for a wide range of permittivity ratios $k$. Furthermore, we determined that the onset of electric field oscillation requires the simultaneous satisfaction of two critical conditions: the geometry must approach a flat boundary ($\theta \to \pi$) and the dielectric ratio must approach homogeneity ($k \to 1$). These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for designing non-singular electric fields and mitigating the common contact angle saturation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k\leq n/2$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension \(n\), then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This result addresses a longstanding question by Baum and Bott regarding the functoriality of residues. Also, This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville-Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $ r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2 $</description>

      <title>Positivity of Boundary Intersections of Complex Curves and Adjunction Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the goals of this paper is to prove that the index of intersection of two complex curves in a two-dimensional complex manifold tangent to each other at a common boundary point is positive. This is achieved via the construction of a totally real surface such that the curves in question are attached to it by some parts of their boundaries and then defining a certain ``boundary intersection index'' of two complex ``half-disks'' with their edges on a totally real surface. We prove that this index is always positive. This second result holds true, more generally, for complex curves in a two dimensional almost complex manifold with boundaries on totally real submanifold, but to our best knowledge is new even for integrable structures, unless the totally real surface in question is supposed to be real analytic. We also formulate and prove the Adjunction Formula for complex curves with boundaries on totally real submanifolds in an almost complex manifold of dimension four.</description>
