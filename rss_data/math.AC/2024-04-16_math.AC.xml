      <title>Separating Variables in Bivariate Polynomial Ideals: the Local Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-algorithm which for any irreducible $p\in\mathbb{K}[x,y]$ finds all elements of $\mathbb{K}(x) + \mathbb{K}(y)$ that are of the form $qp$ for some $q\in\mathbb{K}(x,y)$ whose denominator is not divisible by $p$.</description>

      <title>Primary Decomposition of Symmetric Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an effective method for primary decomposition of symmetric ideals. Let $K[X]=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be the $n$-valuables polynomial ring over a field $K$ and $\mathfrak{S}_n$ the symmetric group of order $n$. We consider the canonical action of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on $K[X]$ i.e. $\sigma(f(x_1,\ldots,x_n))=f(x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,x_{\sigma(n)})$ for $\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_n$. For an ideal $I$ of $K[X]$, $I$ is called {\em symmetric} if $\sigma(I)=I$ for any $\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_n$. For a minimal primary decomposition $I=Q_1\cap \cdots \cap Q_r$ of a symmetric ideal $I$, $\sigma(I)=\sigma (Q_1)\cap \cdots \cap \sigma(Q_r)$ is a minimal primary decomposition of $I$ for any $\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_n$. We utilize this property to compute a full primary decomposition of $I$ efficiently from partial primary components. We investigate the effectiveness of our algorithm by implementing it in the computer algebra system Risa/Asir.</description>

      <title>Ideals preserved by linear changes of coordinates in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the polynomial ring in finitely many variables over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, and initiate the systematic study of ideals preserved by the action of the general linear group by changes of coordinates. We show that these ideals are classified by sets of carry patterns, which are finite sequences of integers introduced by Doty in the study of representation theory of the polynomial ring. We provide an algorithm to decompose an invariant ideal as a sum of carry ideals with no redundancies. Next, we study the conditions under which one carry ideal is contained in another, and completely characterize the image of the multiplication map between the space of linear forms and a subrepresentation of forms of degree d. Finally, we begin an investigation into free resolutions of these ideals. Our results are most explicit in the case of carry ideals in two variables, where we completely describe the monomial generators and syzygies using base-p expansions of the parameters involved, and we provide a formula for the structure of the Tor modules in the Grothendieck group of representations.</description>

      <title>Module schemes in invariant theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group acting linearly on the polynomial ring with invariant ring R. If the action is small, then a classical result of Auslander gives in dimension two a correspondence between linear representations of G and maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules. We establish a correspondence for all linear actions between representations and objects over the invariant ring by looking at quotient module schemes (up to modification) instead of the modules of covariants.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers of normal edge rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach is introduced for computing the multi-graded Betti numbers of normal edge rings. This method is employed to delve into the edge rings of three distinct classes of simple graphs that adhere to the odd-cycle condition. These classes include compact graphs, which are devoid of even cycles and satisfy the odd-cycle condition; graphs comprised of multiple paths converging at two shared vertices; and graphs introduced in \cite{HHKO} that exhibit both even and odd cycles. Explicit formulas are provided for the multi-graded Betti numbers pertaining to the edge rings of these graphs.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular resolutions of powers of matching field ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of monomial ideals, called block diagonal matching field ideals, which arise as monomial Gr\"obner degenerations of determinantal ideals. Our focus is on the minimal free resolutions of these ideals and all of their powers. Initially, we establish their linear quotient property and compute their Betti numbers, illustrating that their minimal free resolution is supported on a regular CW complex. Our proof relies on the results of Herzog and Takayama, demonstrating that ideals with a linear quotient property have a minimal free resolution, and on the construction by Dochtermann and Mohammadi of cellular realizations of these resolutions. We begin by proving the linear quotient property for each power of such an ideal. Subsequently, we show that their corresponding decomposition map is regular, resulting in a minimal cellular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that distinct decomposition maps lead to different cellular complexes with the same face numbers.</description>

      <title>An equivariant BGG correspondence and perfect complexes for extensions by $\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an equivariant extension of Carlsson's BGG correspondence in characteristic two. As an application we classify perfect cochain complexes of $(\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2)\rtimes Q$-representations with four-dimensional total homology for finite groups $Q$ of odd order. We deduce that cochain complexes of finite, free $A_4$-CW complexes with four-dimensional total homology are rigid: They are determined by the degrees of the nonzero homology groups.</description>

      <title>What is the Modular Fourier Transform?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete Fourier transform can be viewed as an isomorphism of the group algebra of a cyclic group to its decomposition in terms of irreducible representations when the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the group. We describe the DFT when $p|n$ by factoring $x^N - 1$ over finite fields. For the symmetric group, the Fourier transform is implemented using representations, Specht modules $S^\lambda$ for partitions $\lambda$, and Maschke's theorem. In the modular case, we construct the Pierce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents $e_i$ in SageMath, yielding a change-of-basis matrix which generalizes the DFT.</description>
