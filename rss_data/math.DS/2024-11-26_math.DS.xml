      <title>Generic density of periodic orbits of area-preserving maps on punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of area-preserving maps in a non-compact setting. We show that the $C^{\infty}$-closing lemma holds for area-preserving diffeomorphisms on a closed surface with finitely many points removed. As a corollary, a $C^{\infty}$-generic area-preserving diffeomorphism on such a surface has a dense set of periodic points. For area-preserving maps on a finitely punctured 2-sphere, we establish a more quantitative result regarding the equidistribution of periodic orbits. The proof of this result involves a PFH Weyl law for rational area-preserving homeomorphisms, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the long-range order of the Spectre tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectre is an aperiodic monotile for the Euclidean plane that is truly chiral in the sense that it tiles the plane without any need for a reflected tile. The topological and dynamical properties of the Spectre tilings are very similar to those of the Hat tilings. Specifically, the Spectre sits within a complex $2$-dimensional family of tilings, most of which involve two shapes rather than one. All tilings in the family give topologically conjugate dynamics, up to an overall rescaling and rotation. They all have pure point dynamical spectrum with continuous eigenfunctions and may be obtained from a $4:2$ dimensional cut-and-project scheme with regular windows of Rauzy fractal type. The diffraction measure of any Spectre tiling is pure point as well. For fixed scale and orientation, varying the shapes is MLD equivalent to merely varying the projection direction. These properties all follow from the first \v{C}ech cohomology being as small as it possibly could be, leaving no room for shape changes that alter the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mean equicontinuous factor maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean equicontinity is a well studied notion for actions. We propose a definition of mean equicontinuous factor maps that generalizes mean equicontinuity to the relative context. For this we work in the context of countable amenable groups. We show that a factor map is equicontinuous, if and only if it is mean equicontinuous and distal. Furthermore, we show that a factor map is topo-isomorphic, if and only if it is mean equicontinuous and proximal. We present that the notions of topo-isomorphy and Banach proximality coincide for all factor maps. In the second part of the paper we turn our attention to decomposition and composition properties. It is well known that a mean equicontinuous action is a topo-isomorphic extension of an equicontinuous action. In the context of minimal and the context of weakly mean equicontinuous actions, respectively, we show that any mean equicontinuous factor map can be decomposed into an equicontinuous factor map after a topo-isomorphic factor map. Furthermore, for factor maps between weakly mean equicontinuous actions we show that a factor map is mean equicontinuous, if and only if it is the composition of an equicontinuous factor map after a topo-isomorphic factor map. We will see that this decomposition is always unique up to conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy laws for the Hausdorff measure of shrinking target sets in $\beta$-dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hausdorff measure of shrinking target sets in $\beta$-dynamical systems. These sets are dynamically defined in analogy to the classical theory of weighted and multiplicative approximation. While the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff dimension theories for these sets are well-understood, the Hausdorff measure theory in even one-dimensional settings remains unknown. We show that the Hausdorff measure of these sets is either zero or full depending upon the convergence or divergence of a certain series, thus providing a rather complete measure theoretic description of these sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that several dynamically defined fractals in $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}^2$ which arise from different type of polynomial dynamical systems can not be the same objects. One of our main results is that the closure of Misiurewicz PCF cubic polynomials (the strong bifurcation locus) cannot be the Julia set of a regular polynomial endomorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$. We also show that the Julia set of a H\'enon map and a polynomial endomorphism cannot coincide.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation in a Generalized Goodwin Model with Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goodwin's model is a cornerstone in the study of dynamical systems within macroeconomics, explaining the interaction between employment ratio and wage share in a closed economy. Analogous to predator-prey dynamics in mathematical economics, the Goodwin model, despite its simplicity, effectively captures the periodic behavior of state variables over specific time intervals. By relaxing the initial assumptions, the model can be adapted to account for more complex economic scenarios. In this article, we study a higher-dimensional extension of the Goodwin model that incorporates variable capacity utilization and capital coefficient alongside employment ratio and wage share. In particular instances, the wage share and employment rate equations decouple from the overall system. For these cases, by incorporating a delay effect in the Phillips curve, we demonstrate that while the equilibrium of the generalized system remains stable within certain parameter domains in the absence of delay, the introduction of delay can induce a Hopf bifurcation, leading to periodic oscillations. We analytically derive the critical delay parameter value that destabilizes the equilibrium point via a Hopf bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Pitchfork Bifurcation In A Coupled Cell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various biological phenomena, like cell differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms, are explained using the bifurcation theory. Molecular network motifs like positive feedback and mutual repressor exhibit bifurcation and are responsible for the emergence of diverse cell types. Mathematical investigations of such problems usually focus on bifurcation in a molecular network in individual cells. However, in a multicellular organism, cells interact, and intercellular interactions affect individual cell dynamics. Therefore, the bifurcation in an ensemble of cells could differ from that for a single cell. This work considers a ring of identical cells. When independent, each cell exhibits supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Using analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the bifurcation in this ensemble when cells interact through positive and negative coupling. We show that within a specific parameter zone, an ensemble of positively coupled cells behaves like a single cell with supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. In this regime, all cells are synchronized and have the same steady state. However, this unique behaviour is lost when cells interact through negative coupling. Apart from the synchronized (or homogenous) states, cell-cell coupling leads to certain heterogeneous steady states with unique patterns. We also investigate the distribution of such heterogeneous states under positive and negative coupling.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Delta Transitions in Cortical Rhythms as grazing bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jansen-Rit model of a cortical column in the cerebral cortex is widely used to simulate spontaneous brain activity (EEG) and event-related potentials. It couples a pyramidal cell population with two interneuron populations, of which one is fast and excitatory and the other slow and inhibitory. Our paper studies the transition between alpha and delta oscillations produced by the model. Delta oscillations are slower than alpha oscillations and have a more complex relaxation-type time profile. In the context of neuronal population activation dynamics, a small threshold means that neurons begin to activate with small input or stimulus, indicating high sensitivity to incoming signals. A steep slope signifies that activation increases sharply as input crosses the threshold. Accordingly in the model the excitatory activation thresholds are small and the slopes are steep. Hence, a singular limit replacing the excitatory activation function with all-or-nothing switches, eg. a Heaviside function, is appropriate. In this limit we identify the transition between alpha and delta oscillations as a discontinuity-induced grazing bifurcation. At the grazing the minimum of the pyramidal-cell output equals the threshold for switching off the excitatory interneuron population, leading to a collapse in excitatory feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discontinuous perturbations of smooth endomorphisms and show that if the perturbed family satisfies uniform mixing assumptions on standard pairs the physical measure is Lipschitz in the parameter defying the perturbation. We also study the problem of linear response for this class of perturbations. Finally we discuss the applicability of the abstract assumptions proving linear response for a concrete example.</description>

      <title>A note on integrabiliy of Hamiltonian systems on the co-adjoint Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we said in our previous work [4], the main idea of our research is to introduce a class of Lie groupoids by means of co-adjoint representation of a Lie groupoid on its isotropy Lie algebroid, which we called coadjoint Lie groupoids. In this paper, we will examine the relationship between structural mappings of the Lie algebroid associated to Lie groupoid and co-adjoint Lie algebroid. Also, we try to construct and define integrabiliy of Hamiltonian system on the co-adjoint Lie groupoids. In addition, we show that co-adjoint Lie groupoid associated to a symplectic Lie groupoid is a symplectic Lie groupoid.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Granular Chains with Modern Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Externally driven dense packings of particles can exhibit nonlinear wave phenomena that are not described by effective medium theory or linearized approximate models. Such nontrivial wave responses can be exploited to design sound-focusing/scrambling devices, acoustic filters, and analog computational units. At high amplitude vibrations or low confinement pressures, the effect of nonlinear particle contacts becomes increasingly noticeable, and the interplay of nonlinearity, disorder, and discreteness in the system gives rise to remarkable properties, particularly useful in designing structures with exotic properties. In this paper, we build upon the data-driven methods in dynamical system analysis and show that the Koopman spectral theory can be applied to granular crystals, enabling their phase space analysis beyond the linearizable regime and without recourse to any approximations considered in the previous works. We show that a deep neural network can map the dynamics to a latent space where the essential nonlinearity of the granular system unfolds into a high-dimensional linear space. As a proof of concept, we use data from numerical simulations of a two-particle system and evaluate the accuracy of the trajectory predictions under various initial conditions. By incorporating data from experimental measurements, our proposed framework can directly capture the underlying dynamics without imposing any assumptions about the physics model. Spectral analysis of the trained surrogate system can help bridge the gap between the simulation results and the physical realization of granular crystals and facilitate the inverse design of materials with desired behaviors.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Survival Model for Stripe Formation in Zebrafish Exhibits Turing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology, including the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a coupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores coordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the model focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of distant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of chromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing bifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively similar to those in nature.
  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper also serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The qualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from continuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids this concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at physically relevant scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the edge zeta function of weighted complex. We also present the formula for the edge zeta function of the standard non-uniform complex $\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[t])\backslash\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q(\!(t^{-1})\!))/\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[\![t^{-1}]\!])$, arising from the group $\operatorname{PGL}_3$, as a rational function. Applying trunction in a specific direction is one of the main ingredient. As a result, we obtain the exact formula for the number of closed cycles coming from geodesics in the building.</description>

Abstract: If $M$ is a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle, the fundamental group of $M$ acts faithfully by homeomorphisms on a circle (the circle at infinity of the universal cover of the fiber), preserving a pair of invariant (stable and unstable) laminations. Many different kinds of dynamical structures (e.g. taut foliations, quasigeodesic or pseudo-Anosov flows) are known to give rise to universal circles -- a circle with a faithful $\pi_1(M)$ action preserving a pair of invariant laminations -- and these universal circles play a key role in relating the dynamical structure to the geometry of $M$. In this paper we introduce the idea of zippers, which give a new and direct way to construct universal circles, streamlining the known constructions in many cases, and giving a host of new constructions in others. In particular, zippers (and their associated universal circles) may be constructed directly from uniform quasimorphisms or from uniform left orders.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior of solution to a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic kinetics: Boundedness, persistence, stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behavior of positive solutions for the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis competition system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic source
  \begin{equation}
  \label{abstract-eq} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v^{\lambda}} \nabla v) +ru- \mu u^2, \quad &amp;x\in \Omega,\cr 0=\Delta v- \alpha v +\beta u,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega, \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases}\, \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N (N \ge 2)$ is a smooth bounded domain, the parameters $\chi,\, r, \, \mu, \, \alpha,\,\beta$ are positive constants and $\lambda \in (0,1).$
  In this article, for all suitably smooth initial data $u_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0 \not \equiv 0,$ it has been proven that:
  First, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_1^*(p,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is $L^p(\Omega)$-bounded with $p \ge 2.$ Next, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_2^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined classical solutions is globally bounded. Third, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_3^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is uniformly bounded above and below eventually by some positive constants that are independent of its initial function $u_0.$ Last, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_4^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\alpha,\beta,r,\Omega)$ such that any globally bounded classical solution to system (0.1) exponentially converges to the constant steady state $(\frac{r}{\mu},\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\frac{r}{\mu}).$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric low-rank matrix factorization serves as a building block in many learning tasks, including matrix recovery and training of neural networks. However, despite a flurry of recent research, the dynamics of its training via non-convex factorized gradient-descent-type methods is not fully understood especially in the over-parameterized regime where the fitted rank is higher than the true rank of the target matrix. To overcome this challenge, we characterize equilibrium points of the gradient flow dynamics and examine their local and global stability properties. To facilitate a precise global analysis, we introduce a nonlinear change of variables that brings the dynamics into a cascade connection of three subsystems whose structure is simpler than the structure of the original system. We demonstrate that the Schur complement to a principal eigenspace of the target matrix is governed by an autonomous system that is decoupled from the rest of the dynamics. In the over-parameterized regime, we show that this Schur complement vanishes at an $O(1/t)$ rate, thereby capturing the slow dynamics that arises from excess parameters. We utilize a Lyapunov-based approach to establish exponential convergence of the other two subsystems. By decoupling the fast and slow parts of the dynamics, we offer new insight into the shape of the trajectories associated with local search algorithms and provide a complete characterization of the equilibrium points and their global stability properties. Such an analysis via nonlinear control techniques may prove useful in several related over-parameterized problems.</description>

      <title>Long time evolution of the H\'enon-Heiles system for small energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The H\'enon-Heiles system, initially introduced as a simplified model of galactic dynamics, has become a paradigmatic example in the study of nonlinear systems. Despite its simplicity, it exhibits remarkably rich dynamical behavior, including the interplay between regular and chaotic orbital dynamics, resonances, and stochastic regions in phase space, which have inspired extensive research in nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we investigate the system's solutions at small energy levels, deriving asymptotic constants of motion that remain valid over remarkably long timescales -- far exceeding the range of validity of conventional perturbation techniques. Our approach leverages the system's inherent two-scale dynamics, employing a novel analytical framework to uncover these long-lived invariants. The derived formulas exhibit excellent agreement with numerical simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the system's long-term behavior.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>

      <title>Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Path-integral formula for computation of Koopman eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman Operator and its spectrum has distinct advantages in terms of linear interpretability of the model as well as in analysis and control synthesis through the use of well-studied techniques from linear systems theory. As such, efficient computation of Koopman eigenfunctions is of paramount importance towards enabling such Koopman-based constructions. To this end, several approaches have been proposed in literature, including data-driven, convex optimization, and Deep Learning-based methods. In our recent work, we proposed a novel approach based on path-integrals that allowed eigenfunction computations using a closed-form formula. In this paper, we present several important developments such as finite-time computations, relaxation of assumptions on the distribution of the principal Koopman eigenvalues, as well as extension towards saddle point systems, which greatly enhance the practical applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Winning opinion: Following Your Friends' Advice or That of Their Friends?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a variation of the classical voter model in which the set of influencing agents depends on an individual's current opinion. The initial population consists of a random sample of equally sized subpopulations for each state, and two types of interactions are considered: (i) direct neighbors, and (ii) second neighbors (friends of direct neighbors, excluding the direct neighbors themselves). The neighborhood size, reflecting regular network connectivity, is kept constant across all agents.
  Our findings reveal that varying the interaction range introduces asymmetries that influence the probability of consensus and convergence time. At low connectivity, direct neighbor interactions dominate, driving consensus. As connectivity increases, the probability of consensus for either state becomes equal, mirroring symmetric dynamics. Asymmetry is also reflected in convergence time: while symmetric cases show decreasing times with increased connectivity, asymmetric cases exhibit an almost linear increase. The introduction of stubborn agents further accentuates these effects, particularly when they favor the less dominant state, significantly increasing consensus time.
  We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for decision-making processes and political campaigns in human populations.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for understanding and controlling monkeypox transmission dynamics in the United States and its implications for future epidemic management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Although the outbreak of human monkeypox (mpox) caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) has slowed down around the world, little is known about the short-term dynamics of this disease. This limited information highlights the critical need to assess the underlying interventions. Method: To identify and re-examine the key pattern of the disease, a modified logistic growth model is presented and analysed in this paper. Our main focus is on the two non-pharmaceutical interventions: policies aimed at reducing human-to-human transmission and animal-to-human transmission. We incorporated these two strategies in the model as control parameters to understand their short-term significance on the epidemic, and to analyse their strengths in minimizing the infected cases. We used mpox data set of the United States from 10 May 2022 to 31 December 2022 in the model and estimated the baseline parameters. Results: The model reveals a complying acceptance to the US data set. Model simulations highlight that preventive measures could play important roles in controlling the deadly spread of the disease in the year of 2022. During the transmission period, better outcomes could have been possible to achieve in the US if both controls were brought to action simultaneously. Conclusion: Our study reflects that continuous application of the preventive strategies might be an effective tool to prevent the short-term outbreak of mpox or similar diseases. Moreover, such strategies could play supporting roles during pre- and post-vaccination periods.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of rational maps by stable multicurves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A completely stable multicurve of a post-critically finite rational map induces a combinatorial decomposition. The projections of the small Julia sets are immersed within the original Julia set. We prove that two small Julia sets are disjoint if and only if they are separated by a coiling curve. Furthermore, we prove that a post-critically finite rational map with a coiling curve is renormalizable.
  Using a similar argument, we give a sufficient condition for a Fatou domain to qualify as a Jordan domain. By tuning polynomails in such a Fatou domain, we provide examples of post-critically finite rational maps with coiling curves.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we calculate the Birkhoff spectrum in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of level sets for Birkhoff averages of continuous potentials for a certain family of diagonally affine IFS's. Also, we study Besicovitch-Eggleston sets for finite GLS number systems with redundancy. The redundancy refers to the fact that each number $x \in [0,1]$ has uncountably many expansions in the system. We determine the Hausdorff dimension of digit frequency sets for such expansions along fibres.</description>

      <title>The topological structure of isolated points in the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R. Pavlov and S. Schmieding provided recently some results about generic $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts, which rely mainly on an original theorem stating that isolated points form a residual set in the space of $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts such that all other residual sets must contain it. As a direction for further research, they pointed towards genericity in the space of G-shifts, where G is a finitely generated group. In the present text, we approach this for the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts, where $d \ge 2$. As it is usual, multidimensional dynamical systems are much more difficult to understand. In light of the result of R. Pavlov and S. Schmieding, it is natural to begin with a better understanding of isolated points. We prove here a characterization of such points in the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts, in terms of the natural notion of maximal subsystems which we also introduce in this article. From this characterization we recover the result of R. Pavlov and S. Schmieding's for $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts. We also prove a series of results which exploit this notion. In particular some transitivity-like properties can be related to the number of maximal subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the Cantor-Bendixon rank of the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts is infinite for $d &gt; 1$, while for $d = 1$ is known to be equal to one.</description>

Abstract: The sets of $\cB$-free integers are considered with respect to (reversing) symmetries. It is well known that, for a large class of them, the centraliser of the associated $\cB$-free shift (otherwise known as its automorphism group) is trivial. We extend this result to the full centraliser, which effectively means to show that all self-homeomorphisms of the $\cB$-free shift that commute with some power of the shift are shifts themselves. This also leads to the result that the full normaliser agrees with the normaliser for this class, which is the semi-direct product of the centraliser with the cyclic group of order two generated by reflection.</description>

Abstract: In this note we study common preperiodic points of rational maps of the Riemann Sphere. We show that given any degrees $d_1,d_2\geq2$, outside a Zariski closed subset of the space of pairs of rational maps $(f,g)$ of degree $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively, the maps $f$ and $g$ share at most a uniformly bounded number of common preperiodic points. This generalizes a result of DeMarco and Mavraki to maps of possibly different degrees. Our main contribution is the use of H\"older properties of the Green function of a rational map to obtain height estimates.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the action of self-consistent transfer operators (STOs) on Birkhoff cones and give sufficient conditions for stability of their fixed points. Our approach relies on the order preservation properties of STOs that can be established via the study of their differential. We focus on the study of STOs arising from strongly coupled maps both deterministic and noisy. Our approach allows for explicit estimates that we use to give examples of STOs with multiple stable fixed points some of which are shown to be far from the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding system of finite coupled maps and give information only on long transients for the finite dimensional system.</description>

This graph contains all post-critical points in the Julia set, while every component of $\overline{\mathbb{C}}\setminus G$ contains at most one post-critical point in the Fatou set. The proof relies on the cluster-Sierpinski decomposition of post-critically finite rational maps.</description>

Abstract: We consider learning the dynamics of a typical nonholonomic system -- the rolling penny. A nonholonomic system is a system subject to nonholonomic constraints. Unlike a holonomic constraints, a nonholonomic constraint does not define a submanifold on the configuration space. Therefore, the inverse problem of finding the constraints has to involve the tangent space. This paper discusses how to learn the dynamics, as well as the constraints for such a system, given the data set of discrete trajectories on the tangent bundle $TQ$.</description>

      <title>An exact solution for a non-autonomous delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution for a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation (DDE) over the entire real-time axis, representing it as a sum of Gaussian-shaped dynamics with distinct peak positions. This marks the first explicit solution for non-autonomous DDEs and is a rare example even among general DDEs. The constructed solution offers key physical insights and facilitates the analysis of system properties, such as the envelope profile of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the Generalized Pareto Distribution-based estimators for the local dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two dynamical indicators, the local dimension and the extremal index, used to quantify persistence in phase space have been developed and applied to different data across various disciplines. These are computed using the asymptotic limit of exceedances over a threshold, which turns to be a Generalized Pareto Distribution in many cases. However the derivation of the asymptotic distribution requires mathematical properties which are not present even in highly idealized dynamical systems, and unlikely to be present in real data. Here we examine in detail issues that arise when estimating these quantities for some known dynamical systems with a particular focus on how the geometry of an invariant set can affect the regularly varying properties of the invariant measure. We demonstrate that singular measures supported on sets of non-integer dimension are typically not regularly varying and that the absence of regular variation makes the estimates resolution dependent. We show as well that the most common extremal index estimation method is ambiguous for continuous time processes sampled at fixed time steps, which is an underlying assumption in its application to data.</description>

      <title>Density of Stable Interval Translation Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that the interval $I=[0,1)$ is partitioned into finitely many intervals $I_1,\dots,I_r$ and consider a map $T\colon I\to I$ so that $T_{\vert I_s}$ is a translation for each $1 \le s \le r$. We do not assume that the images of these intervals are disjoint. Such maps are called Interval Translation Maps. Let $ITM(r)$ be the space of all such transformations, where we fix $r$ but not the intervals $I_1,\dots,I_r$, nor the translations. The set $X(T):=\bigcap_{n\ge 0} T^n[0,1)$ can be a finite union of intervals (in which case the map is called of finite type), or is a disjoint union of finitely many intervals and a Cantor set (in which case the map is called of infinite type). In this paper we show that there exists an open and dense subset $\mathcal{S}(r)$ of $ITM(r)$ consisting of stable maps, i.e. each $T\in \mathcal{S}(r)$ is of finite type, the first return map to any component of $X(T)$ corresponds to a circle rotation and $\mathcal{S}(r) \ni T \mapsto X(T)$ is continuous in the Hausdorff topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of mild solutions to the Boussinesq systems equipped with a generalized gravitational field on the framework of non-compact Riemannian manifolds. We work on some manifolds satisfying some bounded and negative conditions on curvature tensors. We consider a couple of Stokes and heat semigroups associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. By using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup we establish the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for linear systems. Next, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear systems to obtain the well-posedness by using fixed point arguments. Moreover, we will prove the exponential stability of such solutions by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by work of Szymik and Wahl on the homology of Higman-Thompson groups, we establish a general connection between ample groupoids, topological full groups, algebraic K-theory spectra and infinite loop spaces, based on the construction of small permutative categories of compact open bisections. This allows us to analyse homological invariants of topological full groups in terms of homology for ample groupoids.
  Applications include complete rational computations, general vanishing and acyclicity results for group homology of topological full groups as well as a proof of Matui's AH-conjecture for all minimal, ample groupoids with comparison.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove that if $Y$ is a compact manifold, if $Z$ is an Anosov vector field on $Y$, and if $F$ is a flat vector bundle, there is a corresponding canonical nonzero section $\tau_{\nu}\left(i_{Z}\right)$ of the determinant line $\nu=\det H\left(Y,F\right)$. In families, this section is $C^{1}$ with respect to the canonical smooth structure on $\nu$. When $F$ is flat on the total space of the corresponding fibration, our section is flat with respect to the Gauss-Manin connection on $\nu$.</description>

      <title>A representation-theoretical approach to higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems: The symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new procedure for the construction of higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems is proposed. This method is based on techniques belonging to the representation theory of Lie algebras and their realization by vector fields. The notion of intrinsic Lie-Hamilton system is defined, and a sufficiency criterion for this property given. Novel four-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$ are obtained and proved to be intrinsic. Two distinguished subalgebras, the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{6}$ and the Lorentz Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$, are also considered in detail. As applications, coupled time-dependent systems which generalize the Bateman oscillator and the one-dimensional Caldirola-Kanai models are constructed, as well as systems depending on a time-dependent electromagnetic field and generalized coupled oscillators. A superposition rule for these systems, exhibiting interesting symmetry properties, is obtained using the coalgebra method.</description>

      <title>Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces from conformal transformations and some of their applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of two classes of Lie-Hamilton systems on the Euclidean plane to two-dimensional curved spaces, leading to novel Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian spaces (flat $2$-torus, product of hyperbolic lines, sphere and hyperbolic plane), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as to semi-Riemannian spaces (Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes). The vector fields, Hamiltonian functions, symplectic form and constants of the motion of the Euclidean classes are recovered by a contraction process. The construction is based on the structure of certain subalgebras of the so-called conformal algebras of the two-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces. These curved Lie-Hamilton classes allow us to generalize naturally the Riccati, Kummer-Schwarz and Ermakov equations on the Euclidean plane to curved spaces, covering both the Riemannian and Lorentzian possibilities, and where the curvature can be considered as an integrable deformation parameter of the initial Euclidean system.</description>

      <title>Deformation of invariant tori under perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory~(FPT) of dynamical systems, which was initially developed for investigating the shifts of magnetic field line trajectories within the chaotic edge region of plasma when subjected to global perturbations. By contrast, invariant tori reside in the ordered regions of phase space. In magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, these tori manifest as closed flux surfaces, with their nested structure governing radial transport and thus playing a critical role in confinement performance. Using the method of variation as a mathematical foundation, this Letter derives formulae that characterize the deformation of invariant tori under perturbation. These results provide new tools for targeted topology control in tokamak operations and for optimizing stellarator designs by enhancing predictive capability for flux surface behaviour.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic framework for learning non-intrusive corrections to long-time climate simulations from short-time training data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood, physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible, particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data, even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict the anisotropic statistics over time horizons more than 30 times longer than the data seen in training.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Generalised Skew-Symmetric Replicator Equations via Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is a one-to-one mapping between oriented directed graphs and zero-sum replicator dynamics (Lotka-Volterra equations) and that furthermore these dynamics are Hamiltonian in an appropriately defined nonlinear Poisson bracket. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining whether these dynamics are Liouville-Arnold integrable, building on prior work graph in graph decloning by Evripidou et al. [J. Phys. A., 55:325201, 2022] and graph embedding by Paik and Griffin [Phys. Rev. E. 107(5): L052202, 2024]. Using the embedding procedure from Paik and Griffin, we show (with certain caveats) that when a graph producing integrable dynamics is embedded in another graph producing integrable dynamics, the resulting graph structure also produces integrable dynamics. We also construct a new family of graph structures that produces integrable dynamics that does not arise either from embeddings or decloning. We use these results, along with numerical methods, to classify the dynamics generated by almost all oriented directed graphs on six vertices, with three hold-out graphs that generate integrable dynamics and are not part of a natural taxonomy arising from known families and graph operations. These hold-out graphs suggest more structure is available to be found. Moreover, the work suggests that oriented directed graphs leading to integrable dynamics may be classifiable in an analogous way to the classification of finite simple groups, creating the possibility that there is a deep connection between integrable dynamics and combinatorial structures in graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimum Configuration for Hovering n-Quadrotors carrying a Slung Payload</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a strategy for organising quadrotors around a payload to enable hovering without external stimuli, together with a MATLAB software for modelling the dynamics of a quadrotor-payload system. Based on geometric concepts, the proposed design keeps the payload and system centre of mass aligned. Hovering tests that are successful confirm the method's efficiency. Moreover, the algorithm is improved to take thrust capacities and propeller distances into account, calculating the minimum number of quadrotors needed for hovering. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical examples, which reveal that larger quadrotors may require fewer units while smaller ones give greater flexibility.

As an application of this map, we characterize isolated orders on quandles in terms of strong rigidity. As another application, we prove that there is no isolated right order on the free quandles, except for specific cases.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theory of unimodal maps perturbed by an heteroscedastic Markov chain noise and experiencing another heteroscedastic noise due to uncertain observation. We address and treat the filtering problem showing that by collecting more and more observations, one would predict the same distribution for the state of the underlying Markov chain no matter one's initial guess. Moreover we give other limit theorems, emphasizing in particular concentration inequalities and extreme value and Poisson distributions. Our results apply to a family of maps arising from a model of systemic risk in finance.</description>
