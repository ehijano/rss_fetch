      <title>Parallel one forms on special Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of parallel 1-forms on specific Finsler manifolds. We demonstrate that Landsberg manifolds admitting a parallel 1-form have a mean Berwald curvature of rank at most $n-2$. As a result, Landsberg surfaces with parallel 1-forms are necessarily Berwaldian. We further establish that the metrizability freedom of the geodesic spray for Landsberg metrics with parallel 1-forms is at least $2$. We figure out that some special Finsler metrics do not admit a parallel 1-form. Specifically, no parallel 1-form is admitted for any Finsler metrics of non-vanishing scalar curvature, among them the projectively flat metrics with non-vanishing scalar curvature. Furthermore, neither the general Berwald's metric nor the non-Riemannian spherically symmetric metrics admit a parallel 1-form. Consequently, we observe that certain $(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics and generalized $(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics do not admit parallel 1-forms.</description>

      <title>Sandwich operators and Einstein deformations of compact symmetric spaces related to Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformability of the symmetric Einstein metrics on the spaces $\mathrm{SU}(n)/\mathrm{SO}(n)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2n)/\mathrm{Sp}(n)$, thereby concluding the problem to second order for all irreducible symmetric spaces. The obstruction integrals are calculated from invariant polynomials on certain Lie algebra representations. To aid the computation, we develop so-called sandwich operators for compact Lie algebras and relate them to quadratic Casimir operators. We also explain the source of the infinitesimal Einstein deformations on irreducible symmetric spaces, except for the complex Grassmannians, by exploring their relation to simple Jordan algebras. As an application we prove the nonlinear instability of most of the infinitesimally deformable irreducible compact symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities with convex weight in space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive new sharp weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel and Minkowski inequalities for smooth, closed hypersurfaces under various convexity assumptions in Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces. These inequalities extend classical results by incorporating weights given by convex, non-decreasing positive functions, which are otherwise arbitrary. Our approach gives rise to a broad family of geometric inequalities, as each convex, non-decreasing function yields a corresponding inequality, providing considerable flexibility.</description>

      <title>Low regularity approach to Bartnik's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish a version of the Bartnik Splitting Conjecture in the context of Lorentzian length spaces. In precise terms, we show that under an appropriate timelike completeness condition, a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length space of the form $\Sigma\times \mathbb{R}$ with $\Sigma$ compact splits as a metric Lorentzian product, provided it has non negative timelike curvature bounds. This is achieved by showing that the causal boundary of that Lorentzian length space consists on a single point.</description>

      <title>Stability and singular set of the two-convex level set flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The level set flow of a mean-convex closed hypersurface is stable off singularities, in the sense that the level set flow of the perturbed hypersurface would be close in the smooth topology to the original flow wherever the latter is regular. To study the behavior near singularities, we further assume that the initial hypersurface is two-convex and that the flow has finitely many singular times. In this case, the singular set of the flow would have finitely many connected components, each of which is either a point or a compact $C^{1}$ embedded curve. Then under additional conditions, we show that near each connected component of the singular set of the original flow, the perturbed flow would have "the same type" of singular set as that of the singular component.</description>

      <title>Hessian curvature hypersurfaces with prescribed Gauss image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Hessian curvature hypersurfaces with prescribed Gauss images. Given geodesically strictly convex bounded domains $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ in the unit hemisphere, we prove that there is a strictly convex graphic hypersurface defined in $\Omega$ with prescribed $k$-Hessian curvatures such that its Gauss image is $\tilde{\Omega}$. Our proof relies on a novel $C^2$ boundary estimate which utilizes the orthogonal invariance of hypersurfaces. Indeed, we employ some special vector fields generated by the infinitesimal rotations in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to establish the boundary $C^2$ estimates. This new approach enables us to handle the additional negative terms that arise when taking second order derivatives near the boundary.</description>

      <title>Singular metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature and RCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a uniformly Euclidean metric with isolated singularity on $M^n = T^n \# M_0$, $n=6, 7$ or $n\geq 6$, $M_0$ spin and nonnegative scalar curvature on the smooth part is Ricci flat and extends smoothly over the singularity. This confirms Schoen's Conjecture in these cases. The key to the proof is to show that the space has nonnegative synthetic Ricci curvature, i.e., an $RCD(0, n)$ space. Our result also holds when the singular set consists of a finite union of submanifolds (of possibly different dimensions) intersecting transversally under additional assumption on the co-dimension and the location of the singular set.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a definition of the curl of a vector field X on a finite simple graph as the projection of X onto the orthogonal complement of circulation-free vector fields, where a vector field is circulation-free provided its line integral around every simple circuit vanishes. We justify the definition by observing that X and curl X have the same circulation and curl of the gradient and divergence of the curl vanish. This shows the gradient, curl, and divergence operators form an exact sequence, in analogy with the classical case of vector fields on Euclidean domains and yields the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of a vector field on a graph as the sum of a gradient, a curl, and a harmonic field. Along the way, we also prove analogues of the divergence theorem, Green's identities, and Helmholtz's theorem. A consequence of our definition is that the curl is a non-local operator, in sharp contrast to the classical case and existing notions of curl on a graph.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Toda systems with sign-changing prescribed functions: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a compact Riemann surface with area $1$. We investigate the Toda system \begin{align} \begin{cases} -\Delta u_1 = 2\rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1) - \rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1),\\ -\Delta u_2 = 2\rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1) - \rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1), \end{cases} \end{align} on $(M, g)$ where $\rho_1, \rho_2 \in (0,4\pi]$, and $h_1$ and $h_2$ are two smooth functions on $M$.When some $\rho_i$ equals $4\pi$, the Toda system becomes critical with respect to the Moser-Trudinger inequality for it, making the existence problem significantly more challenging. In their seminal article (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 59 (2006), no. 4, 526--558), Jost, Lin, and Wang established sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions the Toda system when $\rho_1=4\pi$, $\rho_2 \in (0,4\pi)$ or $\rho_1=\rho_2=4\pi$, assuming that $h_1$ and $h_2$ are both positive. In our previous paper we extended these results to allow $h_1$ and $h_2$ to change signs in the case $\rho_1=4\pi$, $\rho_2 \in (0,4\pi)$. In this paper we further extend the study to prove that Jost-Lin-Wang's sufficient conditions remain valid even when $h_1$ and $h_2$ can change signs and $\rho_1=\rho_2=4\pi$. Our proof relies on an improved version of the Moser-Trudinger inequality for the Toda system, along with edicated analyses similar to Brezis-Merle type and the use of Pohozaev identities.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural, mathematically consistent definition of the essential (highest possible) regularity of an affine connection -- a geometric property independent of atlas -- together with a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether connections are at their essential regularity. This condition is based on the relative regularity between the connection and its Riemann curvature. Based on this, we prove that authors' theory of the RT-equations provides a computable procedure for constructing coordinate transformations which simultaneously lift connection and curvature components to essential regularity, and lift the atlas of coordinate charts to the regularity required to preserve the essential regularity of the connection. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in a geometry are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally. The theory applies to general affine connections with components in $L^p$, $p&gt;n$, which naturally includes shock wave singularities in General Relativity as well as continuous metrics with infinite gradients, (both obstacles to numerical simulation), but not yet singularities at the lower regularity $p\leq n$ associated with discontinuous metric components, for example, the event horizon of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic $\bf{\partial\bar\partial}$-lemma and several geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a $\partial\bar{\partial}$-type lemma on compact K\"ahler manifolds for logarithmic differential forms valued in the dual of a certain pseudo-effective line bundle, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed by X. Wan.
  We then derive several applications, including strengthened results by H. Esnault-E. Viehweg on the degeneracy of the spectral sequence at the $E_1$-stage for projective manifolds associated with the logarithmic de Rham complex, as well as by L. Katzarkov-M. Kontsevich-T. Pantev on the unobstructed locally trivial deformations of a projective generalized log Calabi-Yau pair with some weights, both of which are extended to the broader context of compact K\"ahler manifolds.
  Furthermore, we establish the K\"ahler version of an injectivity theorem originally formulated by F. Ambro in the algebraic setting. Notably, while O. Fujino previously addressed the K\"ahler case, our proof takes a different approach by avoiding the reliance on mixed Hodge structures for cohomology with compact support.</description>

      <title>Sharpening a gap theorem: nonnegative Ricci and small curvature concentration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We sharpen a gap theorem of Chan &amp; Lee for nonnegative Ricci curvature manifolds that have positive asymptotic volume ratio and small enough scale-invariant integral curvature (so-called "curvature concentration"), by showing that the curvature concentration need only depend linearly on the asymptotic volume ratio. We prove the result by exhibiting a long-time Ricci flow solution with faster than $1/t$ curvature decay, which allows us to shift the limiting contradiction argument to time infinity and thus obtain an explicit bound on the size of the gap.</description>

Since it has been shown that for the case that $q \geq 3$ is odd, $K _0 (C^* (\mathcal{G})) \cong \bbZ $, and moreover the $K$-theoretic index coincides with the Fredholm index, we attempt in this paper to derive a numerical formula for elliptic differential operators on $\mathcal{G}$. Our approach is similar to that of renormalized trace of Moroianu and Nistor \cite{Nistor;Hom2}. However, we find that when $q \geq 3$, the eta term vanishes, and hence the $K$-theoretic and Fredholm indices of elliptic (respectively fully elliptic) pseudo-differential operators on these groupoids are given only by the Atiyah-Singer term. As for the $q=1$ case we find that the result depends on how the singularity set $M_1$ lies in $M$.</description>

      <title>Barcode entropy of geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the barcode entropy for geodesic flows of closed Riemannian manifolds, which measures the exponential growth rate of the number of not-too-short bars in the Morse-theoretic barcode of the energy functional. We prove that the barcode entropy bounds from below the topological entropy of the geodesic flow and, conversely, bounds from above the topological entropy of any hyperbolic compact invariant set. As a consequence, for Riemannian metrics on surfaces, the barcode entropy is equal to the topological entropy. A key to the proofs and of independent interest is a crossing energy theorem for gradient flow lines of the energy functional.</description>

      <title>Deformation and $K$-theoretic Index Formulae on Boundary Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary groupoids were introduced by the second author, which can be used to model many analysis problems on singular spaces. In order to investigate index theory on boundary groupoids, we introduce the notion of {\em a deformation from the pair groupoid}.Under the assumption that a deformation from the pair groupoid $M \times M$ exists for Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G}\rightrightarrows M$, we construct explicitly a deformation index map relating the analytic index on $\mathcal{G}$ and the index on the pair groupoid. We apply this map to boundary groupoids of the form $\mathcal{G} = M_0 \times M_0 \sqcup G \times M_1 \times M_1 \rightrightarrows M=M_0\sqcup M_1$, where $G$ is an exponential Lie group, to obtain index formulae for (fully) elliptic (pseudo)-differential operators on $\mathcal{G}$, with the aid of the index formula by M. J. Pflaum, H. Posthuma, and X. Tang. These results recover and generalize our previous results for renormalizable boundary groupoids via the method of renormalized trace.</description>

      <title>A strong counterexample to the log canonical Beauville--Bogomolov decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $d \geq 4$, we construct a $d$-dimensional, log canonical, $K$-trivial variety with the property that two general fibers of its Albanese morphism are not birational. This provides a strong counterexample to the Beauville--Bogomolov decomposition in the log canonical setting. This construction can also be adapted to construct a smooth quasi-projective variety of logarithmic Kodaira dimension 0 whose quasi-Albanese morphism has maximal variation. On the positive side, we show that the Albanese morphism for log canonical pairs with nef anti-canonical class is a locally stable family of pairs.</description>
