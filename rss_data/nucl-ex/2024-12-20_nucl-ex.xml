      <title>$\beta$-Decay Spectroscopy of $^{23}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the beta decay of the proton-rich nucleus 23Al. The nucleus was generated at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) through projectile fragmentation, utilizing a primary beam of 36Ar ions directed at a 9Be target. Simultaneous measurements of proton emission and gamma rays were conducted using the GADGET detection system. The decay paths were carefully analyzed through beta-gamma , proton-gamma , and gamma -gamma coincidences, leading to the construction of a complete decay scheme for 23Al. The absolute beta branching ratios were determined, and log-ft values were calculated for transitions to 23Mg states. Additionally, proton branching ratios and the most precise half-life measurement of 23Al to date were obtained. The findings include the identification of 19 new gamma rays and the discovery of a new beta-delayed proton transition populating the third excited state of 22Na.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of the Gaseous Proton Recoil Telescope for quasi-absolute neutron flux measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of neutronics simulations of actual or future reactor cores is nowadays driven by the precision of the nuclear data used as input. Among the most important neutron-induced fission cross sections to understand well are the actinides. It is, indeed, of primary importance to know accurately these cross sections around 1 MeV for the safety of Generation IV reactors. High accuracy measurements of neutron flux are essential for accurate cross section measurements; measurements of this flux with respect to the 1 H(n,n)p cross section can be made with the proton recoil technique. For an accurate measurement below 1 MeV, the Gaseous Proton Recoil Telescope (GPRT) is developed and characterized, with the aim to provide quasi-absolute neutron flux measurements with an accuracy better than 2%. This detector is composed of a double ionization chamber with a Micromegas segmented detection plane. The pressure of the gas can be adjusted to protons stopping range -and therefore to neutrons energy. An accurate neutron flux measurement requires that the GPRT has an intrinsic efficiency of 100%, and thus an important effort has been made to verify this. An alpha source and proton micro-beam have been used and the intrinsic efficiency is confirmed to be 100%. Additionally, the dead-time of the detector has been investigated on a test bench, and is found to be 7.3 ms.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Heavy Neutrinos with Heliospheric Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10$ MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Thermal dilepton polarization and dynamics of the QCD plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of the polarization of lepton pairs produced in $\sqrts = 5.02 $ TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, using next-to-leading order (NLO) dilepton emission rates. These calculations employ a multi-stage framework to simulate the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and to explore the sensitivity of polarization to early times. It is found that the intermediate invariant-mass dileptons are indeed probes of the thermal equilibration process, and go beyond the reach of hadronic observables. We compute the polarization anisotropy coefficient obtained with LO dilepton rates, and show that the LO and NLO results differ radically, both in trend and in magnitude, at low and intermediate lepton pair invariant masses.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to charged hadrons with high-precision data from the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are essential non-perturbative QCD inputs for predicting hadron production cross sections in high energy scatterings. In this study, we present a joint determination of FFs for light charged hadrons through a global analysis at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. Our analysis incorporates a wide range of precision measurements from the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. By including measurements of jet fragmentation at the LHC in our global analysis, we are able to impose strong constraints on the gluon FFs. A careful selection of hadron kinematics is applied to ensure the validity of factorization and perturbative calculations of QCD. In addition, we introduce several methodological advances in fitting, resulting in a flexible parametrization form and the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties from perturbative calculations. Our best-fit predictions show very good agreement with the global data, with $\chi^2/N_{pt}\sim 0.90$. We also generate a large number of Hessian error sets to estimate uncertainties and correlations of the extracted FFs. FFs to charged pions (kaons and protons) are well constrained for momentum fractions down to 0.01 (0.1). Total momentum of partons carried by light charged hadrons are determined precisely. Their values for $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon saturate at about 50\% for a lower cut of the momentum fraction of 0.01. Pulls from individual datasets and impact of various choices of the analysis are also studied in details. Additionally, we present an update of the FMNLO program used for calculating hadron production cross sections. Our FFs, including the error sets (denoted as NPC23), are publicly available in the form of LHAPDF6 grids.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enabled Measurements of Astrophysical (p,n) Reactions with the SECAR Recoil Separator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of heavy elements in supernovae is affected by low-energy (n,p) and (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei, yet experimental data on such reaction rates are scarce. The SECAR (SEparator for CApture Reactions) recoil separator at FRIB (Facility for Rare Isotope Beams) was originally designed to measure astrophysical reactions that change the mass of a nucleus significantly. We used a novel approach that integrates machine learning with ion-optical simulations to find an ion-optical solution for the separator that enables the measurement of (p,n) reactions, despite the reaction leaving the mass of the nucleus nearly unchanged. A new measurement of the $^{58}$Fe(p,n)$^{58}$Co reaction in inverse kinematics with a 3.66$\pm$0.12 MeV/nucleon $^{58}$Fe beam (corresponding to 3.69$\pm$0.12 MeV proton energy in normal kinematics) yielded a cross-section of 20.3$\pm$6.3 mb and served as a benchmark for the new technique demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving the required performance criteria. This novel approach marks a significant advancement in experimental nuclear astrophysics, as it paves the way for studying astrophysically important (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei produced at FRIB.</description>
