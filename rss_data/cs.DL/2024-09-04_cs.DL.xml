      <title>LCA and energy efficiency in buildings: mapping more than twenty years of research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is being conducted in various sectors, from analyzing building materials and components to comprehensive evaluations of entire structures. However, reviews of the existing literature have been unable to provide a comprehensive overview of research in this field, leaving scholars without a definitive guideline for future investigations. This paper aims to fill this gap, mapping more than twenty years of research. Using an innovative methodology that combines social network analysis and text mining, the paper examined 8024 scientific abstracts. The authors identified seven key thematic groups, building and sustainability clusters (BSCs). To assess their significance in the broader discourse on building and sustainability, the semantic brand score (SBS) indicator was applied. Additionally, building and sustainability trends were tracked, focusing on the LCA concept. The major research topics mainly relate to building materials and energy efficiency. In addition to presenting an innovative approach to reviewing extensive literature domains, the article also provides insights into emerging and underdeveloped themes, outlining crucial future research directions.</description>

      <title>Examining Different Research Communities: Authorship Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Google Scholar is one of the top search engines to access research articles across multiple disciplines for scholarly literature. Google scholar advance search option gives the privilege to extract articles based on phrases, publishers name, authors name, time duration etc. In this work, we collected Google Scholar data (2000-2021) for two different research domains in computer science: Data Mining and Software Engineering. The scholar database resources are powerful for network analysis, data mining, and identify links between authors via authorship network. We examined coauthor-ship network for each domain and studied their network structure. Extensive experiments are performed to analyze publications trend and identifying influential authors and affiliated organizations for each domain. The network analysis shows that the networks features are distinct from one another and exhibit small communities within the influential authors of a particular domain.</description>

      <title>Simbanex: Similarity-based Exploration of IEEE VIS Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embeddings are powerful tools for transforming complex and unstructured data into numeric formats suitable for computational analysis tasks. In this work, we use multiple embeddings for similarity calculations to be applied in bibliometrics and scientometrics. We build a multivariate network (MVN) from a large set of scientific publications and explore an aspect-driven analysis approach to reveal similarity patterns in the given publication data. By dividing our MVN into separately embeddable aspects, we are able to obtain a flexible vector representation which we use as input to a novel method of similarity-based clustering. Based on these preprocessing steps, we developed a visual analytics application, called Simbanex, that has been designed for the interactive visual exploration of similarity patterns within the underlying publications.</description>

      <title>Coverage and metadata availability of African publications in OpenAlex: A comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike traditional proprietary data sources like Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), OpenAlex emphasizes its comprehensive coverage, particularly highlighting its inclusion of the humanities, non-English languages, and research from the Global South. Strengthening diversity and inclusivity in science is crucial for ethical and practical reasons. This paper analyses OpenAlex's coverage and metadata availability of African-based publications. For this purpose, we compare OpenAlex with Scopus, WoS, and African Journals Online (AJOL). We first compare the coverage of African research publications in OpenAlex against that of WoS, Scopus, and AJOL. We then assess and compare the available metadata for OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS publications. Our analysis shows that OpenAlex offers the most extensive publication coverage. In terms of metadata, OpenAlex offers a high coverage of publication and author information. It performs worse regarding affiliations, references, and funder information. Importantly, our results also show that metadata availability in OpenAlex is better for publications that are also indexed in Scopus or WoS.</description>

      <title>Widespread misidentification of SEM instruments in the peer-reviewed materials science and engineering literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials science and engineering (MSE) research has, for the most part, escaped the doubts raised about the reliability of the scientific literature by recent large-scale replication studies in psychology and cancer biology. However, users on post-publication peer review sites have recently identified dozens of articles where the make and model of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) listed in the text of the paper does not match the instrument's metadata visible in the images in the published article. In order to systematically investigate this potential risk to the MSE literature, we develop a semi-automated approach to scan published figures for this metadata and check it against the SEM instrument identified in the text. Starting from an exhaustive set of 1,067,102 articles published since 2010 in 50 journals with impact factors ranging from 2 to 24, we identify 11,314 articles for which SEM make and model can be identified in an image's metadata. For 21.2% of those articles, the image metadata does not match the SEM manufacturer or model listed in the text and, for another 24.7%, at least some of the instruments used in the study are not reported. Unexplained patterns common to many of these articles suggest the involvement of paper mills, organizations that mass-produce, sell authorship on, and publish fraudulent scientific manuscripts at scale.</description>

      <title>Post-OCR Text Correction for Bulgarian Historical Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitization of historical documents is crucial for preserving the cultural heritage of the society. An important step in this process is converting scanned images to text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which can enable further search, information extraction, etc. Unfortunately, this is a hard problem as standard OCR tools are not tailored to deal with historical orthography as well as with challenging layouts. Thus, it is standard to apply an additional text correction step on the OCR output when dealing with such documents. In this work, we focus on Bulgarian, and we create the first benchmark dataset for evaluating the OCR text correction for historical Bulgarian documents written in the first standardized Bulgarian orthography: the Drinov orthography from the 19th century. We further develop a method for automatically generating synthetic data in this orthography, as well as in the subsequent Ivanchev orthography, by leveraging vast amounts of contemporary literature Bulgarian texts. We then use state-of-the-art LLMs and encoder-decoder framework which we augment with diagonal attention loss and copy and coverage mechanisms to improve the post-OCR text correction. The proposed method reduces the errors introduced during recognition and improves the quality of the documents by 25\%, which is an increase of 16\% compared to the state-of-the-art on the ICDAR 2019 Bulgarian dataset. We release our data and code at \url{https://github.com/angelbeshirov/post-ocr-text-correction}.}</description>

      <title>The Role of Large Language Models in Musicology: Are We Ready to Trust the Machines?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in musicology. From a discussion with experts and students, we assess the current acceptance and concerns regarding this, nowadays ubiquitous, technology. We aim to go one step further, proposing a semi-automatic method to create an initial benchmark using retrieval-augmented generation models and multiple-choice question generation, validated by human experts. Our evaluation on 400 human-validated questions shows that current vanilla LLMs are less reliable than retrieval augmented generation from music dictionaries. This paper suggests that the potential of LLMs in musicology requires musicology driven research that can specialized LLMs by including accurate and reliable domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the effects of sharing research data, code, and preprints on citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calls to make scientific research more open have gained traction with a range of societal stakeholders. Open Science practices include but are not limited to the early sharing of results via preprints and openly sharing outputs such as data and code to make research more reproducible and extensible. Existing evidence shows that adopting Open Science practices has effects in several domains. In this study, we investigate whether adopting one or more Open Science practices leads to significantly higher citations for an associated publication, which is one form of academic impact. We use a novel dataset known as Open Science Indicators, produced by PLOS and DataSeer, which includes all PLOS publications from 2018 to 2023 as well as a comparison group sampled from the PMC Open Access Subset. In total, we analyze circa 122'000 publications. We calculate publication and author-level citation indicators and use a broad set of control variables to isolate the effect of Open Science Indicators on received citations. We show that Open Science practices are adopted to different degrees across scientific disciplines. We find that the early release of a publication as a preprint correlates with a significant positive citation advantage of about 20.2% on average. We also find that sharing data in an online repository correlates with a smaller yet still positive citation advantage of 4.3% on average. However, we do not find a significant citation advantage for sharing code. Further research is needed on additional or alternative measures of impact beyond citations. Our results are likely to be of interest to researchers, as well as publishers, research funders, and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Decoding Knowledge Claims: The Evaluation of Scientific Publication Contributions through Semantic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges the use of publication counts as a measure of scientific progress, requiring alternative metrics that emphasize the quality and novelty of scientific contributions rather than sheer quantity. This paper proposes the use of Relaxed Word Mover's Distance (RWMD), a semantic text similarity measure, to evaluate the novelty of scientific papers. We hypothesize that RWMD can more effectively gauge the growth of scientific knowledge. To test such an assumption, we apply RWMD to evaluate seminal papers, with Hirsch's H-Index paper as a primary case study. We compare RWMD results across three groups: 1) H-Index-related papers, 2) scientometric studies, and 3) unrelated papers, aiming to discern redundant literature and hype from genuine innovations. Findings suggest that emphasizing knowledge claims offers a deeper insight into scientific contributions, marking RWMD as a promising alternative method to traditional citation metrics, thus better tracking significant scientific breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>Mens Sana In Corpore Sano: Sound Firmware Corpora for Vulnerability Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Firmware corpora for vulnerability research should be scientifically sound. Yet, several practical challenges complicate the creation of sound corpora: Sample acquisition, e.g., is hard and one must overcome the barrier of proprietary or encrypted data. As image contents are unknown prior analysis, it is hard to select high-quality samples that can satisfy scientific demands. Ideally, we help each other out by sharing data. But here, sharing is problematic due to copyright laws. Instead, papers must carefully document each step of corpus creation: If a step is unclear, replicability is jeopardized. This has cascading effects on result verifiability, representativeness, and, thus, soundness.
  Despite all challenges, how can we maintain the soundness of firmware corpora? This paper thoroughly analyzes the problem space and investigates its impact on research: We distill practical binary analysis challenges that significantly influence corpus creation. We use these insights to derive guidelines that help researchers to nurture corpus replicability and representativeness. We apply them to 44 top tier papers and systematically analyze scientific corpus creation practices. Our comprehensive analysis confirms that there is currently no common ground in related work. It shows the added value of our guidelines, as they discover methodical issues in corpus creation and unveil miniscule step stones in documentation. These blur visions on representativeness, hinder replicability, and, thus, negatively impact the soundness of otherwise excellent work.
  Finally, we show the feasibility of our guidelines and build a new, replicable corpus for large-scale analyses on Linux firmware: LFwC. We share rich meta data for good (and proven) replicability. We verify unpacking, deduplicate, identify contents, provide ground truth, and show LFwC's utility for research.</description>
