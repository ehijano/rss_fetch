      <title>Simulation of Non-Premixed, Supersonic Combustion using the Discontinuous Galerkin Method on Fully Unstructured Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, three-dimensional simulations of a reacting hydrogen jet in supersonic crossflow using a structure-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation are examined. The hydrogen jet, with a momentum flux ratio of five, is injected into a high enthalpy crossflow. The sensitivities of the solution to the grid element size and polynomial order are investigated to determine an accurate and computationally efficient approach to simulating high-speed airbreathing propulsion vehicles. The results demonstrate that DG(p = 2) solutions, which are nominally third-order accurate in smooth regions of the flow, show reasonable agreement with existing experimental results. The separation shock formation behind the jet is found to be heavily grid dependent and necessary for accurate simulations of the reacting jet in supersonic crossflow. It is determined that the highest resolution cell and polynomial order is required to capture the upstream separation shock and consequently the flame stabilization point. The mixing and combustion mode is also determined using the flame index and demonstrates the flow is heavily skewed towards a non-premixed diffusion mode which is consistent with previously run simulations of this case using traditional finite volume schemes and sub grid scale modeling approaches. Beyond this analysis, the novelty of this work lies in demonstrating a high-speed, multicomponent, chemically reacting flow on a fully unstructured tetrahedral mesh: a first-of-its-kind calculation. This highlights the potential of these methods for simulating fluids in complex geometries with complex physics</description>

      <title>Linear response of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the response of wind tunnel turbulence to perturbations using an active grid. We compare our findings to Kraichnan's linear response result $R(k,\tau_d) = \exp(-k^2 \: \tau_d^2 \: u^2)$ which predicts a decay of the response with increasing turbulence intensity $u$, wave number of the perturbation $k$ and delay time $\tau_d$ since the perturbation was applied (kraichnan.1964). In our experiments we used two different mechanisms to create a perturbation of a pre--existing and well--developed turbulent flow. In the first case we combine both the turbulence generation and the additional random perturbation in the same active grid. We find that the reponse decays with increasing $\tau_d$, but much slower than predicted, while the decay was virtually independent of the turbulence intensity. In the second type of experiments, we perturb an active grid-generated turbulent flow using a loudspeaker--driven synthetic jet. The perturbation is at a single wave number $k$, placed well inside the inertial range. The response was found to decay with increasing time delay $\tau_d$, while the decay is faster for larger wave numbers, roughly as predicted by Kraichnan's model. However, also in this case the decay rate is independent of the turbulence intensity.</description>

      <title>The seed-carrying stalk of the linden diaspore ensures autorotating flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersal of seeds by wind is one of the most evolved mechanisms plants use to invade new territories. Linden trees grow diaspores with a curved bract acting as a wing, where the seed pods are connected underneath by a stalk. Besides the seed-carrying capacity, the other functions of the stalk remain unknown. We demonstrate that the stalk of linden (genus Tilia L.) diaspores plays an essential role in their flight. The stalk length to wing span ratio is found to be the key parameter for facilitating steady autorotating flight in Tilia x europaea diaspores, effectively doubling their flight time compared to an unsteady tumbling motion. Flight experiments with biological and synthetic diaspores reveal a critical stalk length needed to induce autorotation, which correlates with analysis of collected biological samples and points to a possible evolutionarily selected trait. Flow measurements show that the vortical structures around the curved wing cause the elevated lift force during the autorotating flight.</description>

      <title>Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This information-theoretic analysis may provide a theoretical basis for regulating turbulence by controlling zonal flow.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum encoding of a turbulent field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chaotic structure of multiscale systems presents a formidable challenge to their quantum encoding. We propose a three-stage hyperspherical encoding method for turbulent fields. This method comprises a symmetry-preserving perturbation of the ground state, a measurement-specific convolution, and a final deconvolution of observables. The latter two stages employ the Hopf fibration to map quantum observables onto vortex tubes, the building blocks of fluid turbulence. Using 27 qubits, we generate an instantaneous turbulent field at a Reynolds number of $\mathit{Re} = 13900$ that reproduces the energy spectrum with Kolmogorov's five-thirds scaling, tangled vortex structures, and strong intermittency. The method only requires $\mathcal{O}(\log_2\mathit{Re})$ qubits, which is asymptotically optimal for turbulent-field encoding. This yields an exponential memory reduction over classical methods, and enables state preparation for large-scale quantum simulation of multiscale systems.</description>

      <title>Rational Extended Thermodynamics for Non-Newtonian Fluids with Finite Relaxation Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional, hyperbolic model for non-Newtonian fluids with finite relaxation time, derived within the framework of Rational Extended Thermodynamics (RET). Unlike classical parabolic models, our formulation preserves finite signal speeds, thermodynamic consistency, and mathematical well-posedness. The model captures viscoelastic phenomena via a nonlinear evolution of stress, converging to power-law rheology in the vanishing relaxation limit. Notably, it mimics the Phan-Thien-Tanner model under steady shear, but derives from first principles, offering a predictive alternative to empirical rheology.</description>

      <title>Simulation Method of Microscale Fluid-Structure Interactions: Diffuse-Resistance-Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of microscale fluid-structure interactions (mFSI) in multicomponent multiphase flows pose many challenges, including the thermodynamic consistency of multiphysics couplings, tracking of moving interfaces, dynamics of moving triple-phase contact lines, and the coupling of multiphase hydrodynamics with phase transition dynamics. We propose and validate a generic DNS approach: Diffuse-Resistance-Domain (DRD) approach. It overcomes the above challenges by employing Onsager's variational principle (OVP) to formulate dynamic models and combining traditional diffuse-interface models for fluid-fluid interfacial dynamics with a novel implementation of complex fluid-solid interfacial conditions via smooth interpolations of dynamic-resistance coefficients across interfaces. After careful validation by numerous benchmark simulations, we simulated several cutting-edge, challenging mFSI problems across diverse fields. This generic DNS approach offers a promising tool for elucidating physical mechanisms, manipulating microscale fluid dynamics, and optimizing engineering processes across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of buoyancy-aided mixed convective flow past a square cylinder inclined at 45 degrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study numerically investigates the two-dimensional mixed convective flow of air past a square cylinder placed at an angle of incidence $\alpha = 45^{\circ}$ to the free-stream. We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a Reynolds number (Re) of 100, a range of Richardson numbers (Ri) between 0.0 and 1.0, and a Prandtl number (Pr) of 0.7. The critical Richardson number at which the near-field becomes a steady flow from an unsteady one lies between $0.65$ and $0.7$, along with a simultaneous emergence of the far-field unsteadiness. There is no range of Ri for which the entire flow field is seen to be steady. At a relatively moderate Ri, the flow field reveals the presence of vorticity inversion through the momentum addition in the downstream region. We discuss the dual wake-plume nature of the flow behind the cylinder. The wake exhibits characteristics similar to those of a plume, revealing a self-similar behavior in the far-field at increased buoyancy. We explore the cause of the far-field unsteadiness and discuss the mechanism of the observed flow physics using instantaneous and time-averaged flow fields. The important flow quantities, such as force coefficients, vortex shedding frequency, and Nusselt number, are discussed at various Richardson numbers.</description>

      <title>Incremental Model Order Reduction of Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering simulations are usually based on complex, grid-based, or mesh-free methods for solving partial differential equations. The results of these methods cover large fields of physical quantities at very many discrete spatial locations and temporal points. Efficient compression methods can be helpful for processing and reusing such large amounts of data. A compression technique is attractive if it causes only a small additional effort and the loss of information with strong compression is low. The paper presents the development of an incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) strategy for compressing time-dependent particle simulation results. The approach is based on an algorithm that was previously developed for grid-based, regular snapshot data matrices. It is further developed here to process highly irregular data matrices generated by particle simulation methods during simulation. Various aspects important for information loss, computational effort and storage requirements are discussed, and corresponding solution techniques are investigated. These include the development of an adaptive rank truncation approach, the assessment of imputation strategies to close snapshot matrix gaps caused by temporarily inactive particles, a suggestion for sequencing the data history into temporal windows as well as bundling the SVD updates. The simulation-accompanying method is embedded in a parallel, industrialized Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics software and applied to several 2D and 3D test cases. The proposed approach reduces the memory requirement by about 90% and increases the computational effort by about 10%, while preserving the required accuracy. For the final application of a water turbine, the temporal evolution of the force and torque values for the compressed and simulated data is in excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Transient Growth in Streaky Unbounded Shear Flow: A symbiosis of Orr and Push-over mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient growth mechanisms operating on streaky shear flows are believed important for sustaining near-wall turbulence. Of the three individual mechanisms present - Orr, lift-up and 'push over' - Lozano-Duran et. al. (J. Fluid Mech. 914, A8, 2021) have recently observed that both Orr and push over need to be present to sustain turbulent fluctuations given streaky (streamwise-independent) base fields whereas lift-up does not. We show here, using Kelvin's model of unbounded constant shear augmented by spanwise-periodic streaks, that this is because the push-over mechanism can act in concert with a Orr mechanism based upon the streaks to produce much-enhanced transient growth. The model clarifies the transient growth mechanism originally found by Schoppa &amp; Hussain, (J. Fluid Mech. 453, 57-108, 2002) and finds that this is one half of a linear instability mechanism centred at the spanwise inflexion points observed originally by Swearingen &amp; Blackwelder (J. Fluid Mech. 182, 255-290, 1987). The instability and even transient growth acting on its own are found to have the correct nonlinear feedback to generate streamwise rolls which can then re-energise the assumed streaks through lift-up indicating a sustaining cycle. Our results therefore support the view that while lift-up is believed central for the roll-to-streak regenerative process, it is Orr and push-over mechanisms that are both key for the streak-to-roll regenerative process in near-wall turbulence.</description>

      <title>Jet-noise reduction via streak generation in the nozzle boundary layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic and acoustic fields of turbulent jets issuing from nozzles modified by the addition of cylindrical tabs on the inner surface, one diameter upstream of the exit. The tabs are designed to promote significant growth of steady streaks in the nozzle turbulent boundary layer. A baseline smooth nozzle is also studied for comparison. Acoustic measurements are made using an azimuthal array for Mach numbers in the range 0.4 $\leq M_j \leq$ 0.9. The tabs are found to reduce the emitted sound levels by up to 3 dB/St. In terms of overall sound pressure levels (OASPL), reductions of up to 3 dB are observed at all measured polar angles in the range 20 deg $\leq \theta \leq$ 90 deg. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) experiments are conducted to measure the three components of velocity for a series of cross-stream planes at $M_j =$ 0.7. A Floquet-based Fourier decomposition is applied for the azimuthally periodic flow field, and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is then employed to extract coherent structures. Comparison of the structures obtained for nozzles with and without tabs shows an enhancement of the streaky structures by the tabs and a damping of Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) wavepackets. A linear model based on the one-way Navier-Stokes equations (OWNS) is employed to explore the underlying amplification mechanisms and how these are impacted by the tabs. The model reproduces the growth-attenuation mechanism observed in the data, showing that the changes in the mean flow induced by the streaks work to reduce the amplification of the noise-generating coherent structures associated with linear spatial growth mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Modulating the number of particles in a region is key to accurately capturing the nuances in compressible flows with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). This paper presents a volume-based adaptive refinement and derefinement procedure, with state-of-the-art features such as automatic local adaptivity and solution adaptivity applied in the context of compressible flows. A shock-aware particle shifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while preserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle shifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow in and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these adaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster. For instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to achieve an order of magnitude increase in computational speed. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity procedure in resolving issues such as errors arising from the interaction with differently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like structures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions. In essence, the adaptivity technique presented in this paper is a powerful tool for simulating compressible flows with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unsteady Thermal and Flow Structures of an Impinging Sweeping Jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sweeping jets are increasingly employed in thermal management and flow control applications due to their inherent unsteadiness and ability to cover wide surface areas. This study investigates the unsteady heat transfer and flow structures of an impinging sweeping jet, with particular emphasis on the influence of Reynolds number (Re) and nozzle-to-plate spacing (L/D). A combined diagnostic approach, utilising non-synchronous high-speed infrared thermography and planar particle image velocimetry, independently measures wall heat flux distributions and flow field dynamics. Time-averaged Nusselt number maps reveal a progressive widening of the thermal footprint as the nozzle-to-plate distance increases, accompanied by a reduction in peak heat transfer intensity. In contrast, the fluctuating component exhibits a double-lobe structure that becomes more pronounced at higher Re. Velocity measurements confirm the presence of a bifurcated jet core and shear-driven unsteadiness, with fluctuating velocity components and Reynolds shear stress spatially correlated with zones of enhanced heat transfer fluctuations. A direct spatial comparison between velocity and heat transfer fluctuations demonstrates that wall-normal velocity unsteadiness dominates the thermal response at low nozzle-to-plate distances, while streamwise fluctuations become increasingly significant at larger spacings. Finally, the full-field heat transfer data are embedded into a reduced-order parametric space, where the complex system behaviour is effectively represented by a low-dimensional manifold governed by Re and L/D. This manifold is used to perform an efficient surrogate model capable of predicting both mean and fluctuating Nusselt number maps for untested combinations of Re and L/D within the parametric space, serving as a tool for the preliminary sizing and design of heat transfer enhancement devices.</description>

      <title>Attention on flow control: transformer-based reinforcement learning for lift regulation in highly disturbed flows</title>

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions, but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic lift in arbitrarily long gust sequences via pitch control. The random gusts produce intermittent, high-variance flows observed only through limited surface pressure sensors, making this control problem inherently challenging compared to stationary flows. The transformer addresses the challenge of partial observability from the limited surface pressures. We demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques -- pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord pitching.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the feedback control of a weakly conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow via Lorentz forces generated by externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</description>
