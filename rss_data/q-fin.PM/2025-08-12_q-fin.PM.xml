      <title>Unwitting Markowitz' Simplification of Portfolio Random Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his famous paper, Markowitz (1952) derived the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of its securities. This result allowed Markowitz to obtain his famous expression for portfolio variance. We show that Markowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for portfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation of the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the securities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show this, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his portfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his securities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio as with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and variance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities describe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and on the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random volumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation for the portfolio's random returns. The market-based variance of the portfolio accounts for the effects of random fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. The use of Markowitz variance may give significantly higher or lower estimates than market-based portfolio variance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fees for Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive liquidity providers (LPs) in automated market makers (AMMs) face losses due to adverse selection (LVR), which static trading fees often fail to offset in practice. We study the key determinants of LP profitability in a dynamic reduced-form model where an AMM operates in parallel with a centralized exchange (CEX), traders route their orders optimally to the venue offering the better price, and arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies. Using large-scale simulations and real market data, we analyze how LP profits vary with market conditions such as volatility and trading volume, and characterize the optimal AMM fee as a function of these conditions. We highlight the mechanisms driving these relationships through extensive comparative statics, and confirm the model's relevance through market data calibration. A key trade-off emerges: fees must be low enough to attract volume, yet high enough to earn sufficient revenues and mitigate arbitrage losses. We find that under normal market conditions, the optimal AMM fee is competitive with the trading cost on the CEX and remarkably stable, whereas in periods of very high volatility, a high fee protects passive LPs from severe losses. These findings suggest that a threshold-type dynamic fee schedule is both robust enough to market conditions and improves LP outcomes.</description>

      <title>Mean--Variance Portfolio Selection by Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms, Regret Analysis, and Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study continuous-time mean--variance portfolio selection in markets where stock prices are diffusion processes driven by observable factors that are also diffusion processes, yet the coefficients of these processes are unknown. Based on the recently developed reinforcement learning (RL) theory for diffusion processes, we present a general data-driven RL algorithm that learns the pre-committed investment strategy directly without attempting to learn or estimate the market coefficients. For multi-stock Black--Scholes markets without factors, we further devise a baseline algorithm and prove its performance guarantee by deriving a sublinear regret bound in terms of the Sharpe ratio. For performance enhancement and practical implementation, we modify the baseline algorithm and carry out an extensive empirical study to compare its performance, in terms of a host of common metrics, with a large number of widely employed portfolio allocation strategies on S\&amp;P 500 constituents. The results demonstrate that the proposed continuous-time RL strategy is consistently among the best, especially in a volatile bear market, and decisively outperforms the model-based continuous-time counterparts by significant margins.</description>
