      <title>Turbulent scaling law in Ogata K\=orin's Red and White Plum Blossoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stylized turbulent swirls depicted in artworks are often analyzed with the modern tools for real turbulent flows such as the power spectrum and the structure function. Motivated by the recent study on The Starry Night of van Gogh (Ma et al., Phys. Fluids, 36 095140, 2024), we here analyze the swirling motif in Ogata K\=orin's Red and White Plum Blossoms. The results show that K\=orin's swirls follow closely the Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum $k^{-5/3}$ in the inertial-convective range of the passive scalar advected by the homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. Furthermore the swirl's 4-th and 6-th structure functions exhibit approximately the same intermittent scaling law of the passive scalar.</description>

      <title>Improved phase field model for two-phase incompressible flows: Sharp interface limit, universal mobility and surface tension calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved phase field model for interface capturing in simulating two-phase incompressible flows. The model incorporates a second-order diffusion term, which utilizes a nonlinear coefficient to assess the degree of deviation of interface profile from its equilibrium state. In particular, we analyze the scale of the mobility in the model, to ensure that the model asymptotically approaches the sharp interface limit as the interface thickness approaches zero. For accurate calculations of surface tension, we introduce a generalized form of smoothed Dirac delta functions that can adjust the thickness of the tension layer, while strictly maintaining that its integral equals one, even when the interface profile is not in equilibrium. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that the spontaneous shrinkage of under-resolved interface structures encountered in the Cahn-Hilliard phase field method does not occur in the improved phase field model. Through various numerical experiments, we determine the range of the optimal mobility, confirm the theoretical analysis of the improved phase field model, verify its convergence, and examine the performance of different surface tension models. The numerical experiments include Rayleigh-Taylor instability, axisymmetric rising bubbles, droplet migration due to the Marangoni effect, partial coalescence of a droplet into a pool, and deformation of three-dimensional droplet in shear flow. In all these cases, numerical results are validated against experimental data and/or theoretical predictions. Moreover, the recommended range of dimensionless mobility has been shown to be universal, as it can be effectively applied to the simulations of a wide range of two-phase flows and exhibits excellent performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Cassie-Baxter Model: New Insights for Predicting Imbibition in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of liquid imbibition in a single pore with spatially varying wettability. Starting from the Lucas-Washburn equation, we derive analytical solutions for the imbibition time (crossing time) in systems where wettability alternates between two materials. For ordered arrangements, we demonstrate that the imbibition speed depends non-trivially on the spatial distribution, with the "more hydrophobic-first" configuration being optimal. For disordered systems, where segment lengths follow a Gaussian distribution, we show that the classical Cassie-Baxter contact angle, originally derived for static wetting, fails to predict the dynamics of capillary-driven flow. To address this, we propose a new weighted harmonic averaging method for the contact angle, which accurately describes the viscous crossing time in such heterogeneous systems. Our findings reveal fundamental insights into the role of wettability heterogeneity in capillary-driven flow, offering a basis for understanding imbibition dynamics in complex heterogeneous systems.

      <title>Hopper flows of dense suspensions: a 2D microfluidic model system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flows of particles through bottlenecks are ubiquitous in nature and industry, involving both dry granular materials and suspensions. However, practical limitations of conventional experimental setups hinder the full understanding of these flows in confined geometries. Here, we present a microfluidic setup to investigate experimentally the flow of dense suspensions in a two-dimensional hopper channel. Particles with controlled properties are in-situ fabricated with a photolithographic projection method and compacted at the channel constriction using a Quake valve. The setup is characterized by examining the flow of a dense suspension of hard, monodisperse disks through constrictions of varying widths. We demonstrate that the microfluidic hopper discharges particles at constant rate, resulting from the channel resistance being dominated by the presence of densely packed particles within the tapered section of the hopper. Under imposed flow rate the discharge remains independent of particle and orifice sizes, whereas it exhibits a Beverloo-like scaling under pressure-imposed conditions. Additionally, we show that the statistics of clog formation in our microfluidic hopper follow the same stochastic laws as reported in other systems. Finally, we show how the versatility of our microfluidic model system can be used to investigate the outflow and clogging of suspensions of more complex particles.</description>

      <title>Self-tuning model predictive control for wake flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a noise-robust closed-loop control strategy for wake flows employing model predictive control. The proposed control framework involves the autonomous offline selection of hyperparameters, eliminating the need for user interaction. To this purpose, Bayesian optimisation maximises the control performance, adapting to external disturbances, plant model inaccuracies and actuation constraints. The noise robustness of the control is achieved through sensor data smoothing based on local polynomial regression. The plant model can be identified through either theoretical formulation or using existing data-driven techniques. In this work we leverage the latter approach, which requires minimal user intervention. The self-tuned control strategy is applied to the control of the wake of the fluidic pinball, with the plant model based solely on aerodynamic force measurements. The closed-loop actuation results in two distinct control mechanisms: boat tailing for drag reduction and stagnation point control for lift stabilization. The control strategy proves to be highly effective even in realistic noise scenarios, despite relying on a plant model based on a reduced number of sensors.</description>

      <title>Wave and turbulence separation using dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Separating the effects of waves and turbulence in oceanographic time series is an ongoing challenge because surface wave motion and turbulence fluctuations can occur at overlapping frequencies. Therefore, simple bandpass filters cannot effectively separate their dynamics. While more advanced decomposition techniques have been developed, they often entail restrictive assumptions about the wave and turbulence interactions, require synchronized measurements, and/or only decompose the signal spectrally without a time-series reconstruction. We present our new wave-turbulence decomposition technique which uses dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The technique is signal-agnostic so it can be applied to any time series, and our only assumptions are that the waves and turbulence can be separated and that the waves are the most coherent features in the signal. Our approach requires minimal tuning, where the main user input is the wave frequency range of interest. To demonstrate the method, we apply it to synthetic, field, and laboratory data, and compare the results to other mode-based decomposition methods. A sensitivity analysis on the synthetic data shows that the most sensitive parameter to the accuracy is the rank truncation in the DMD, and that the decomposition performs the best when the wave energy in the signal is of equal or greater magnitude than that of the turbulence. Given the accuracy of our decomposition, we are able to analyze the velocity autocorrelation of the separated turbulence time series with minimal wave contamination. Overall, our decomposition method outperforms the other decomposition methods and provides for robust separation of the waves and turbulence, demonstrating wide applicability to ocean signal processing.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>
