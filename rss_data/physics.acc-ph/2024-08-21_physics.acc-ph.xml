      <title>A Comparative Study of Neutron Irradiation for Genetic Mutations: Spallation, Reactor, and Compact Neutron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron beam, being electrically neutral and highly penetrating, offers unique advantages for irradiation of biological species such as plants, seeds, and microorganisms. We comprehensively investigate the potential of neutron irradiation for inducing genetic mutations using simulations of J-PARC BL10, JRR-3 TNRF, and KUANS for spallation, reactor, and compact neutron sources. We analyze neutron flux, energy deposition rates, and Linear Energy Transfer (LET) distributions. KUANS demonstrated the highest dose rate of 17 Gy/h, significantly surpassing BL10, due to the large solid angle by the optimal sample placement. The findings highlight KUANS's suitability for efficient genetic mutations and neutron breeding, particularly for inducing targeted mutations in biological samples. The LET range of KUANS is concentrated in 20-70 keV/{\mu}m, which is potentially ideal for inducing specific genetic mutations. The importance of choosing neutron sources based on LET requirements to maximize mutation induction efficiency is emphasized. This research shows the potential of compact neutron sources like KUANS for effective biological irradiation and neutron breeding, offering a viable alternative to larger facilities. The neutron filters used in BL10 and TNRF effectively excluded low-energy neutrons with keeping the high LET component. The neutron capture reaction, 14N(n,p)14C, was found to be the main dose under thermal neutron-dominated conditions.</description>

      <title>Results of High Order Modes Spectra Measurements in 1.3 GHz Cavities for LCLS-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermilab recently completed production and testing of 1.3 GHz cryomodules for the LCLS-II project. Each cryomodule consists of eight TESLA-shaped superconducting elliptical cavities equipped with two High Order Mode (HOM) coupler ports. Measurement of the HOM spectrum is part of the incoming quality control of cavities at room temperature and the final qualification cold test of cryomodules at the Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF). In this paper we describe the procedure for measuring the HOM spectrum along with further data processing. Finally, we present accumulated statistics of individual HOM frequencies and quality factors related to various cavity vendors and discuss the possible contribution of HOMs to heat loads and beam dynamics.</description>

      <title>PIP-II Linac Cryogenic Distribution System Design Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PIP-II linac Cryogenic Distribution System (CDS) is characterized by extremely small heat inflows and robust mechanical design. It consists of a Distribution Valve Box (DVB), Intermediate Transfer Line, Tunnel Transfer Line, comprising 25 Bayonet Cans, and ends with a Turnaround Can. Multiple helium streams, each characterized by distinct helium parameters, flow through each of these elements. The CDS geometry allows maintaining an acceptable pressure drop for each helium stream, considering the planned flows and helium parameters in different operation modes. This is particularly crucial for the return line of helium vapors, which return from cryomodules to the cold compressors and thus have very restrictive pressure drop requirements. On both sides of the DVB there are fixed supports for process pipes. One of the DVB design challenges was to route the process pipes in such a way that their shape provided sufficient compensation for thermal shrinkage. This ensures th at the forces resulting from thermal shrinkage acting on the cryogenic valves remain at a level acceptable to the manufacturer. The required thermal budget of the CDS was achieved by thermo-mechanical optimization of its components, like process pipes fixed supports in Bayonet Cans.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design of A 20 T Dipole Based on Hybrid REBCO/Nb3Sn Cos-theta Coil*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a design concept of an HTS/LTS hybrid dipole with 50 mm aperture and 20 T nominal field based on a cos-theta coil and a cold iron yoke. The HTS part of magnet coil uses REBCO Twisted Stacked Tape cable. The LTS part is graded and made of two Nb3Sn Rutherford cables. Due to high sensitivity of HTS/LTS coils to large stresses and strains at high fields, a Stress Management (SM) concept combined with the cos-theta coil geometry is used. The results of magnet magnetic analysis are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Beam-induced backgrounds measured in the ATLAS detector during local gas injection into the LHC beam vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inelastic beam-gas collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), within a few hundred metres of the ATLAS experiment, are known to give the dominant contribution to beam backgrounds. These are monitored by ATLAS with a dedicated Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and with the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. These two methods are complementary since the BCM probes backgrounds just around the beam pipe while fake jets are observed at radii of up to several metres. In order to quantify the correlation between the residual gas density in the LHC beam vacuum and the experimental backgrounds recorded by ATLAS, several dedicated tests were performed during LHC Run 2. Local pressure bumps, with a gas density several orders of magnitude higher than during normal operation, were introduced at different locations. The changes of beam-related backgrounds, seen in ATLAS, are correlated with the local pressure variation. In addition the rates of beam-gas events are estimated from the pressure measurements and pressure bump profiles obtained from calculations. Using these rates, the efficiency of the ATLAS beam background monitors to detect beam-gas events is derived as a function of distance from the interaction point. These efficiencies and characteristic distributions of fake jets from the beam backgrounds are found to be in good agreement with results of beam-gas simulations performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo programme.</description>
