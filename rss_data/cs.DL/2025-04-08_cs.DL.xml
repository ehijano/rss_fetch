      <title>In which fields do ChatGPT 4o scores align better than citations with research quality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although citation-based indicators are widely used for research evaluation, they are not useful for recently published research, reflect only one of the three common dimensions of research quality, and have little value in some social sciences, arts and humanities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to address some of these weaknesses, with ChatGPT 4o-mini showing the most promising results, although on incomplete data. This article reports by far the largest scale evaluation of ChatGPT 4o-mini yet, and also evaluates its larger sibling ChatGPT 4o. Based on comparisons between LLM scores, averaged over 5 repetitions, and departmental average quality scores for 107,212 UK-based refereed journal articles, ChatGPT 4o is marginally better than ChatGPT 4o-mini in most of the 34 field-based Units of Assessment (UoAs) tested, although combining both gives better results than either one. ChatGPT 4o scores have a positive correlation with research quality in 33 of the 34 UoAs, with the results being statistically significant in 31. ChatGPT 4o scores had a higher correlation with research quality than long term citation rates in 21 out of 34 UoAs and a higher correlation than short term citation rates in 26 out of 34 UoAs. The main limitation is that it is not clear whether ChatGPT leverages public information about departmental research quality to cheat with its scores. In summary, the results give the first large scale evidence that ChatGPT 4o is competitive with citations as a new research quality indicator, but ChatGPT 4o-mini, which is more cost-effective.</description>

      <title>The Disruption Index Measures Displacement Between a Paper and Its Most Cited Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initially developed to capture technical innovation and later adapted to identify scientific breakthroughs, the Disruption Index (D-index) offers the first quantitative framework for analyzing transformative research. Despite its promise, prior studies have struggled to clarify its theoretical foundations, raising concerns about potential bias. Here, we show that-contrary to the common belief that the D-index measures absolute innovation-it captures relative innovation: a paper's ability to displace its most-cited reference. In this way, the D-index reflects scientific progress as the replacement of older answers with newer ones to the same fundamental question-much like light bulbs replacing candles. We support this insight through mathematical analysis, expert surveys, and large-scale bibliometric evidence. To facilitate replication, validation, and broader use, we release a dataset of D-index values for 49 million journal articles (1800-2024) based on OpenAlex.</description>

      <title>Content-aware rankings: a new approach to rankings in scholarship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity rankings (e.g., institutions, journals) are a core component of academia and related industries. Existing approaches to institutional rankings have relied on a variety of data sources, and approaches to computing outcomes, but remain controversial. One limitation of existing approaches is reliance on scholarly output (e.g., number of publications associated with a given institution during a time period). We propose a new approach to rankings - one that relies not on scholarly output, but rather on the type of citations received (an implementation of the Scite Index). We describe how the necessary data can be gathered, as well as how relevant metrics are computed. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present rankings of fields, journals, and institutions, and discuss the various ways Scite's data can be deployed in the context of rankings. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO's potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods.</description>
