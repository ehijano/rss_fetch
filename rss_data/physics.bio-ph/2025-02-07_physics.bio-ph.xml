      <title>Modeling the prion protein-mediated transport of extracellular vesicles on the neuron surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are among the leading causes of global mortality. They are characterized by the progressive deterioration of specific neuron populations, ultimately leading to cognitive decline and dementia. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are crucial players in the early stages of such diseases, acting as carriers of pathogens and contributing to neuroinflammation and disease propagation. This study proposes a mathematical model to elucidate the movement of EVs bearing prion protein (PrP) on their surface along neuronal surfaces. Supported by experimental data, the model explores the role of the actin polymerization on the EVs transport dynamics. EVs isolated from non-human astrocytes were analyzed under three conditions: untreated control (Ctrl), neurons treated with Cytochalasin D (CytoD-HN), and EVs treated with Cytochalasin D (CytoD-EV). Our mathematical model effectively explained the experimental data. In the CytoD-EV dataset, EV movement was modeled using a flashing Brownian ratchet, reflecting directed movement. For active transport in the CytoD-HN set, a symmetric periodic potential models the rolling of the Evs on the neuron surface. The Ctrl scenario results in a combination of the two mechanisms. Finally, a sensitivity and comparative analysis between numerical results and experimental data showed that the model effectively replicates the Evs motion.</description>

      <title>Free Growth under Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the ground breaking work of Trepat et al. in 2009, we know that cell colonies growing on a substrate can be under tensile mechanical stress. The origin of tension has so far been attributed to cellular motility forces being oriented outward of the colony. Works in the field mainly revolve around how this orientation of the forces can be explained, ranging from velocity alignment, self-sorting due to self-propulsion, to kenotaxis. In this work, we demonstrate that tension in growing colonies can also be explained without cellular motility forces! Using a combination of well established tissue growth simulation technique and analytical modelling, we show how tension can arise as a consequence of simple mechanics of growing tissues. Combining these models with a minimalistic motility model shows how colonies can expand while under even larger tension. Furthermore, our results and analytical models provide novel analysis procedures to identify the underlying mechanics.</description>

      <title>Resolving shortwave and longwave irradiation distributions across the human body in outdoor built environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outdoor built environments can be designed to enhance thermal comfort, yet the relationship between the two is often assessed in whole-body terms, overlooking the asymmetric nature of thermal interactions between the human body and its surroundings. Moreover, the radiative component of heat exchange-dominant in hot and dry climates-is typically lumped into a single artificial metric, the mean radiant temperature, rather than being resolved into its shortwave and longwave spectral components. The shortwave irradiation distribution on the human body is often highly anisotropic, causing localized thermal discomfort in outdoor environments. However, no existing methods effectively quantify shortwave and longwave irradiation distributions on the human body. To address this gap, we developed two methods to quantify these processes. The first approach uses an outdoor thermal manikin with a white-coated side, enabling the separation of spectral components by subtracting measurements from symmetrically corresponding surface zones of tan color. The second hybrid approach converts radiometer measurements in six directions into boundary conditions for computational thermal manikin simulations. We evaluated irradiation distributions for various body parts using both methods during outdoor measurements across sunny, partially shaded, and fully shaded sites under warm to extremely hot conditions. In most cases, the two methods produced closely aligned results, with divergences highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Additionally, we used the manikin to quantify irradiation attenuation provided by five long-sleeve shirts with colors ranging from white to black. These advanced methods can be integrated with airflow and thermoregulatory modeling to optimize outdoor built environments for enhanced human thermal comfort.</description>

      <title>Shape-asymmetry and flexibility in active cross-stream migration in nonuniform shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the interplay of activity and broken fore-aft symmetry of shapes helps microswimmers to migrate across streamlines in nonuniform shear, emphasizing a hitherto overlooked fundamental cause of active cross-stream migration in imposed flows. Using a framework on model flagellated microswimmers in a microchannel flow, we find that besides the broken head-tail shape symmetry, extended hydrodynamic coupling is vital for cross-stream migration, whereas flagellar flexibility significantly affects the same. Furthermore, by simplifying the problem to a basic analytical model, we are able to identify the fundamental factors affecting the observed rich nonlinear dynamics and predict the sorting and control of microswimmer populations inside a microchannel. Our predictions are general and apply to both living and artificial microswimmers, whereas the hydrodynamic framework developed here is necessary to probe other scenarios, such as in dense suspensions, where non-uniform shear and near-field flows become important.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in e. coli through negative chemotaxis: instability, condensation, and merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motile bacteria can migrate along chemical gradients in a process known as chemotaxis. When exposed to uniform environmental stress, Escherichia coli cells coordinate their chemotactic responses to form millimeter-sized condensates containing hundreds of thousands of motile cells. In this study, we combined experiments with mathematical modeling based on modified Keller-Segel equations to investigate the dynamics of this collective behavior across three distinct time scales: the shortest time scale, where spatial instability emerges; an intermediate time scale, where quasi-stationary bacterial condensates form; and finally, a longer time scale, during which neighboring bacterial accumulations coalesce. The model closely agrees with experimental results, quantitatively capturing the observed instability, the shape of mature condensates, and their coalescence dynamics. Specifically, we found that the force between neighboring bacterial accumulations decays exponentially with distance due to screening effects. We suggest that the model presented here could describe more broadly the dynamics of stress-induced condensation mediated by bacterial chemotaxis.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on long-pulsed transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for neuromodulation applications. However, continuous sonication through the skull introduces significant wave interactions, complicating precise energy delivery to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure insertion losses for historical were 3.6$\pm$3.4 dB, 9.3$\pm$3.3 dB, and 14.8$\pm$5.8 dB, respectively, and for Thiel skulls, the respective losses were 2.9$\pm$1.8 dB, 9.4$\pm$2.6 dB, and 17.0$\pm$5.5 dB. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure, power and focal area was investigated and linear fits produced. Several unfavorable focusing performances were observed in regions with excessive thickness variation. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Preliminary findings indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to 1/2 under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities, we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recover bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Censor-Aware Semi-Supervised Survival Time Prediction in Lung Cancer Using Clinical and Radiomics Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Lung cancer poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic methods for personalized treatment. This study introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that integrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models handling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET and CT data from 199 lung cancer patients from public and local data respositories, focusing on overall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep Radiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA software and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of censored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio survival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold cross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET HRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.5%, achieving 1.55 years with PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR (p&lt;0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR achieved an MAE of 2.08 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p&lt;0.05). In HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating high- and low-risk groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the SSL strategy significantly outperforms SL across PET, CT, and CF. As such, censor-aware SSL applied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction performance by 26.5% compared to the SL approach.</description>
