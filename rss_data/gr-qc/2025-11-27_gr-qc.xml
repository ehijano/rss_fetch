      <title>Causal Rigidity and the Single-Unit Universe: Integrating the Alexandrov-Zeeman and Unruh Clock Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify two complementary viewpoints on relativistic spacetime and the counting of fundamental constants. Operationally, Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, and Vanzella (MPSV) have recently argued that relativistic spacetime requires only a single fundamental dimensional constant. Mathematically, theorems due to Alexandrov and Zeeman demonstrate that the light-cone structure determines the spacetime geometry only up to a conformal factor. We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry. We provide a formal derivation proving that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class, thereby clarifying that the number of fundamental constants is exactly one.</description>

      <title>Denoising gravitational wave with deep learning in the time-frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave denoising is an ongoing task for revealing the events of compact binary objects in the universe. Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent dynamics of quasiclassical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Wormholes as perturbations of near-horizon black hole geometries: no-go theorems within effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the construction of wormhole solutions as perturbations around near-horizon geometries of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes in four dimensions and equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry black holes in five dimensions. When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.</description>

      <title>Observational appearance and photon rings of non-singular black holes from anisotropic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optical appearance of a non-singular, spherically symmetric black hole from Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity coupled to anisotropic fluids. Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties.</description>

      <title>Black holes immersed in modified Chaplygin-like dark fluid and cloud of strings: shadows, quasinomal modes and greybody factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified investigation of black hole shadows, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and greybody factors (GBFs) for a static, spherically symmetric black hole within a composite environment of a modified Chaplygin-like dark fluid (MCDF) and a cloud of strings (CoS). We examine the structure of critical photon orbits and the corresponding optical appearance under spherical accretion. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, we compute the quasinormal frequencies and greybody spectra, and explore their correspondence with the black hole shadows in the eikonal limit. A systematic parameter study demonstrates that the CoS intensity has the primary influence on the shadows, QNMs and GBFs, while the MCDF parameters introduce more complex but characterizable modifications to each. Our results demonstrate that these environmental components imprint distinct yet interrelated signatures on key observables, offering specific predictions for probing exotic black hole environments.</description>

      <title>Scattering of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman black holes, with incidence along the equatorial plane, is investigated in this work. The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\sim 135^{\circ} &lt; \phi &lt; 270^{\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive. These findings highlight unique equatorial-plane signatures of charged, rotating spacetimes, distinguishing them from prior on-axis analyses.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally-Induced Photon Entanglement in an FLRW Cosmological Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to detect the quantum nature of gravity, the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses(QGEM) has been proposed both in flat and curved spacetime. In this paper we propose an analogous QGEM protocol using photons produced in astronomical processes as the quantum systems. Unlike massive particles, the gravitational interaction between photons-intrinsically relativistic particles-simultaneously satisfies both the event and system localities. So it can provide a clear test of whether the gravitational mediator must be nonclassical based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) principle. Although the gravitationally induced entanglement between massless relativistic photons is extremely small, our quantitative calculations clarify the characteristic features of the entanglement induced by the photon's own gravitational field in astronomical process and may inspire other photon entanglement experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotically decaying tails that characterize the late-time dynamics of collapsing self-gravitating charged massless scalar fields were studied three decades ago by Hod and Piran (HP). In particular, it was shown, both analytically and numerically, that the late-time behavior of these collapsing charged massless scalar fields is governed by oscillatory inverse power law tails, which decay more slowly than the familiar tails of neutral massless fields. Recently \'Alvares and Va\~no-Vi\~nuales (AVV) have investigated the same model numerically. While most of their results are in very good agreement with the earlier findings of HP, there are also some discrepancies between the original results of HP and those reported by AVV. In this compact comment, we wish to highlight a number of inaccurate claims and critical errors in the analysis and results presented by AVV.</description>

      <title>Simpson-Visser-AdS Black Holes: Thermodynamics and Binary Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we performed Simpson-Visser (SV)-regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and then studied thermal properties of the resulting spacetime geometry. We considered the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics in this case and derived an entropy formula consistent with this new regular geometry. Next, we carried out the free energy analysis and studied the phase structure of these black holes. We discovered non-trivial phase transition properties dependent on the SV-regularization parameter. We also considered the validity of the second law of black hole thermodynamics and analyzed a merger scenario of two equal mass SV-regular black holes. In particular, we investigated the impact of the SV-regularization parameter on the constraints on post-merger black hole mass. Intrestingly, we found that the bounds initially increase and then fall sharply with increasing the SV-regularization parameter. All results are compared with standard black holes for vanishing SV-regularization parameter.</description>

Abstract: We consider collisional Penrose process for charged, rotating black holes together with a simple model of pair creation, in which two oppositely charged particles are produced in a collision of two neutral particles. We highlight that significant energy extraction is possible without assuming fine-tuning or extremality as long as the escaping particles are sufficiently charged.</description>

      <title>The relativistic tidal tensor: general solutions for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes and the Hills mass of naked singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.</description>

      <title>Analytic First-Order Entanglement Entropy of Schwarzschild Black Holes with Interacting Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries and separability structures of Ovcharenko-Podolsk\'y and conformal-to-Carter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a remarkable new class of spacetimes describing black holes immersed in a non-aligned electromagnetic field has been found. While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full "tower of symmetries". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics. Moreover, as we shall show, the novel spacetimes provide an interesting test-ground for studying the recently defined Penrose charges whose existence is intrinsically related to hidden rather than explicit symmetries.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of the Extended Uncertainty Principle: Energy Conditions, Stability, and Late Time Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological consequences of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) by deriving modified Friedmann equations through thermodynamic arguments. The evolution of the effective equation of state induced by EUP corrections is analyzed and characterized using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization. We then examine the fulfillment of classical energy conditions, including the null, weak, strong, and dominant conditions. The dynamical and thermodynamic stability of the model is investigated, showing that the EUP cosmology admits a late-time de Sitter attractor. Finally, we evaluate the effective speed of sound associated with the model and discuss implications for perturbative stability. Our findings indicate that EUP-induced corrections can produce a consistent late-time acceleration without requiring a cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the gravitational waves produced after the coalescence of two neutron stars is greatly anticipated because it will be able to provide information about matter in extreme conditions, especially if the remnant turns out to go through a hypermassive or a supermassive neutron star state before collapsing into a black hole. Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence.</description>

      <title>Tidal forces around the Letelier-Alencar cloud of strings black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate relativistic tidal forces around a black hole sourced by a cloud of strings, described by the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution. We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>Game Theory in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential role of area metrics, a generalised notion of geometry, in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Guided by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the first law of entanglement, we derive both a holographic dictionary as well as a bulk equation of motion for area metric fluctuations linearised around a four dimensional AdS background. Furthermore, we explore potential bulk Lagrangians that could give rise to the derived equation. It is shown that writing area metric fluctuations in terms of Lanczos like potentials gives rise to a particularly elegant bulk model.</description>

      <title>High-Order Photon Rings around Kerr Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of higher-order photon rings of an accreting Kerr naked singularity (KNS) with dimensionless spin parameter $a=1.01$; i.e., a horizonless, overly spinning compact object. Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 2. Constraints on Dark Energy, Spatial Curvature, and Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out an independent re-analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) public dataset, focusing on extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$), spatial curvature ($o\Lambda$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\approx30\%$ and $\approx20\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_\nu&lt;0.32\,{\rm eV}$, with the $30\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\%$ improvement assuming the $\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$ model (yielding $M_\nu&lt;0.059\,{\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_\nu&lt;0.097\,{\rm eV}$ in $o\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$ and $M_\nu&lt;0.13\,{\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_\nu$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of models in even spacetime dimensions $2n$ which share many similarities with Chern-Simons theories in odd spacetime dimensions $2n+1$. The independent dynamical variables of these models are a $GL(2n)$-connection and a metric in internal space. The action is a polynomial of degree $n$ in the curvature of the connection, with indices saturated by means of the metric and the Levi-Civita tensor. We show that the theory has no local degree of freedom in $2$ spacetime dimensions ($n=1$), where it can be reformulated as a constrained $BF$ model, but that its dynamics is more intrincate in higher dimensions ($n&gt;1$), where local degrees of freedom are present. We treat in detail the cases of $2$ and $4$ spacetime dimensions.}</description>

      <title>Restoring a Missing Meta-Symmetry of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional quantum mechanics, all unitary evolution takes place within the space-time Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{xt}=L^2(\mathcal M_{xt})$, with time as the sole evolution parameter. The momentum-energy representation $\phi(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert. Here we restore the fundamental symmetry between the conjugate pairs $(x,t)$ and $(k,E)$ by extending the quantum theory to an enlarged Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{\text{total}} = \mathcal H_{xt} \oplus \mathcal H_{kE}$, within which the momentum-energy sector $\mathcal H_{kE}=L^2(\mathcal M_{kE})$ carries its own autonomous unitary evolution generated by a self-adjoint operator $\hat{\mathcal T}$. The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.</description>

      <title>The diverse morphology of gravitational wave signals from merging neutron-star white-dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In sufficiently compact neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems, orbital decay means the white dwarf eventually fills its shrinking Roche lobe, initiating a phase of mass transfer. The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tensions in Proca-Nuevo theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological predictions of (extended) Proca-Nuevo theory. This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at $1.5\sigma$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4\sigma$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8\sigma$ to $2.3\sigma$ (resp. $1.5\sigma$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models.</description>

      <title>Weak gravity at micron scales from dark bubble cosmology and its cosmological consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future. In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\Omega_c \approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant. We end by speculating on how to incorporate AdS black shells as black hole mimickers within the dark bubble model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and $P$-$V$ Criticality of Charged AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings in Kalb-Ramond Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extended phase-space thermodynamics and $P$--$V$ criticality of electrically charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in Kalb--Ramond bumblebee gravity in the presence of a spherically symmetric cloud of strings. The background Kalb--Ramond field induces Lorentz symmetry violation through a dimensionless parameter $\ell$, while the string cloud is characterized by a parameter $\alpha$, both entering the lapse function and deforming the geometry. Interpreting the ADM mass as enthalpy, we derive the main thermodynamic quantities, Hawking temperature, entropy, thermodynamic volume, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat, and analyze how $(\ell,\alpha)$ jointly affect stability and phase structure. We obtain a Van der Waals--type equation of state, compute the critical point $(P_c,T_c,v_c)$, and show that, although the critical scales depend nontrivially on $\ell$ and $\alpha$, the universal ratio $P_c v_c/T_c = 3/8$ is preserved. Using the thermodynamic topology approach, we determine that the total topological charge of the black hole solution remains $W=1$, placing it in the same topological class as the Reissner--Nordstr\"om--AdS black hole. Finally, by studying the Joule--Thomson expansion, we derive the inversion curve and find that the minimal inversion temperature satisfies $T_i^{\rm min}/T_c = 1/2$, as in the Reissner--Nordstr\"om--AdS case, indicating that Lorentz violation and the string cloud deform the thermodynamic scales without changing the underlying universality class.</description>

      <title>Friction in Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve time-reversed stochastic inflation in the semi-infinite flat potential with a constant drift term and derive an exact expression for the probability distribution of the curvature fluctuations. It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.</description>

      <title>Phase-Dependent Photon Emission Rates in Quantum Gravity-Induced Entangled States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, as one of the fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics, has garnered significant attention over the past few decades for its extraordinary nonlocality. With the advancement of quantum technology, quantum entanglement holds promising application for exploring fundamental physical theories. The experimental scheme of Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) was proposed to investigate the quantum effects of gravity based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theory. In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement. Specifically, the transition rate decreases as the degree of entanglement increases when the distance between particle pairs is small, then it gradually approaches an asymptotic value that is independent of entanglement as the distance increases. We then discuss the possibility of using photon emission rates to detect quantum entanglement with these results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Heterotic Black Holes in Duality-Invariant Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effective theory of heterotic strings in two spacetime dimensions, in a double field theory-inspired formalism, manifestly consistent with $T$-duality in string theory. Restricting the gauge group to a single $\mathrm{U}(1)$, we study the charged black hole solution and perform a precise analysis of the properties of the dual geometry with the $\mathrm{O}(1,2; \mathbb{R})$-valued generalized metric. We comment on some aspects related to singularities and gauge dependence. We show that the classification program for higher derivative corrections can also be applied to the heterotic case. We further elucidate how a previously proposed solution to the equations of motion, parametrized in a manner fully non-perturbative in $\alpha'$, can be extended to the scenario with $r$ abelian fields and the corresponding $\mathrm{O}(1,1+r; \mathbb{R})$ symmetry. We discuss some novel features of the solution for charged black holes.</description>

      <title>A Collision Operator for Field-Mediated Interactions in General Relativistic Kinetic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Hamiltonian framework for general relativistic kinetic theory on the cotangent bundle $T^{\ast}M$ of a Lorentzian (pseudo-Riemannian) manifold. Starting from the geodesic Hamiltonian $H$, we derive a Landau-type collision operator for self-gravitating particles undergoing binary interactions mediated by an arbitrary potential energy $V$, and couple the resulting kinetic stress-energy to the Einstein field equations to obtain the Landau-Einstein system. In the presence of a coordinate-time Killing symmetry we find a family of stationary states of the form $f \propto \gamma \exp[-\beta(H+\Phi)]\zeta(p_0)$, where $\Phi$ is the mean field, $\gamma=dt/d\tau$, $\beta$ is an inverse-temperature parameter, and $\zeta$ encodes symmetry-induced degeneracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study explores the thermal evolution and emission properties of neutron stars within the framework of modified $f(R, T)$ gravity by solving the coupled energy-balance and heat-transport equations. We compute stellar mass and pressure profiles by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in both Einstein gravity and modified gravity, employing the APR, FPS, and SLy equations of state, with and without the strong magnetic field. Using these profiles, we assess the red-shifted surface temperature, $T_s^{\infty}$, as well as the photon and neutrino luminosities for each equation of state. We further examine the effects of the magnetic field, the choice of equation of state, and the underlying gravity theory framework on the cooling of neutron stars, particularly those of magnetized neutron stars or magnetars. Our results indicate that $f(R, T)$ gravity, particularly for the APR and SLy equations of state, exhibits improved agreement with the observed $T_s^{\infty}$ and photon luminosities than standard general relativity, regardless of magnetic-field strength. Moreover, it predicts the neutrino luminosities under both gravity models, all the chosen equations of state, and magnetic field configurations.</description>

      <title>Computing the graph-changing dynamics of loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In loop quantum gravity (LQG), states of the gravitational field are represented by labeled graphs called spin networks. Their dynamics can be described by a Hamiltonian constraint, { which acts on the spin network states modifying both spins and graphs.} Fixed-graph approximations of the dynamics have been extensively studied, but its full graph-changing action so far remains elusive. The latter, alongside the solutions of its constraint, are arguably the missing features { in canonical LQG to access phenomenology in all its richness}. Here, we discuss a recently developed numerical tool that, for the first time, implements graph-changing dynamics via the Hamiltonian constraint. We explain how it is used to find new solutions to that constraint and to show that some quantum geometric observables behave differently than in the graph-preserving truncation. We also point out that these new numerical methods can find applications in other domains.</description>

      <title>Penrose inequality for integral energy conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Penrose inequality, a relation between the ADM mass and the area of any cross section of the black hole event horizon, was introduced as a test of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture: if it fails, the trapped surface is not necessarily behind the event horizon and a naked singularity could form. Since that original derivation, a variety of proofs have developed, mainly focused on the initial data formulation on maximal spacelike slices of spacetime. Most of these proofs are applicable only for classical fields, as the energy conditions required are violated in the context of quantum field theory. In this work we provide two generalizations of the Penrose inequality for spherically symmetric spacetimes: a proof of a classical Penrose inequality using initial data and an average energy condition, and a proof of a modified Penrose inequality for evaporating black holes with a connection to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. The latter case could also be applicable to quantum fields as it uses a condition inspired by quantum energy inequalities. Finally, we provide physically motivated examples for both.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>Deriving Entangled Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled Relativity is a non-linear reformulation of Einstein's theory that cannot be defined in the absence of matter fields. It recovers General Relativity without a cosmological constant in the weak matter density limit or whenever $\Lm = T$ on-shell, and it is also more parsimonious in terms of fundamental constants and units. In this paper, we show that Entangled Relativity can be derived from a general $f(R,\Lm)$ theory by imposing a single requirement: the theory must admit all solutions of General Relativity without a cosmological constant whenever $\Lm = T \neq 0$ on-shell, though not necessarily only those solutions. An important consequence is that all vacuum solutions of General Relativity without a cosmological constant are limits of solutions of Entangled Relativity when the matter fields tend to zero. In addition, we introduce a broader class of theories featuring an \textit{intrinsic decoupling}, which, however, do not generally admit the solutions of General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resume our analysis of Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity (NFDG), an alternative gravitational model that does not require the dark matter (DM) paradigm. We add three more galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 3198, NGC 2841) to the catalog of those studied with NFDG methods. Once again, NFDG can successfully reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension $D\left (R\right)$, as with the nine other galaxies previously studied with these methods. In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model, which is capable of deriving the fractional mass dimension $D_{m}\left(R \right)$ from a single equation, as opposed to the previous $D\left (R\right)$, which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data for each galaxy. While the NFDG predictions computed with this new $D_{m}\left(R\right)$ dimension are not as accurate as those based on the original $D\left (R\right)$, they nevertheless confirm the validity of our fractional-dimension approach. Three previously studied galaxies (NGC 7814, NGC 6503, NGC 3741) were analyzed again with these new methods, and their structure was confirmed to be free from any dark matter components.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability of the Weyl geometry considering an exact black hole solution. By calculating the geodesics of massless and massive scalar fields orbiting outside the Weyl black hole background and using the Lyapunov exponent, we show that geodesic instabilities, characterized by the Lyapunov exponent, appear in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Calculating the photon sphere's quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field perturbing the Weyl black hole, we find a relation connecting the QNMs with the Lyapunov exponent in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Furthermore, we study the anomalous decay rate of the QNMs connecting their behavior with the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a summary of several parametrisations for the nuclear equation of state that have been proposed over the past decades and list viable ranges for their parameters. Based on these parametrisations, we construct a large database of rotating neutron star models, which are arranged in sequences of constant central energy density. After filtering these sequences with respect to generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations for various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary rotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low computational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass, radius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The relations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby eliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust. Such relations are important for future, high-precision measurements coming from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations and may be used in equation of state inference codes or gravitational wave modeling among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal plasma induces a plasmon-like mass shift for gravitational perturbations, which can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early radiation-dominated universe. However, there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this mass shift, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the initial plasma state on a perturbed FLRW background. Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis. This cosmological example indicates a more general picture in which local equilibrium in thermal quantum field theory is not an external input but an emergent, dynamical notion.</description>

Abstract: We identify the relativistic-fluid counterpart of the Unruh effect, in which a comoving probe measures a Thermodynamic Unruh temperature. Frame changes in first-order hydrodynamics are recast as a local, time-dependent hyperbolic rotation in a Rindler-style state space where the instantaneous map between frames is the Thermodynamic Boost and its proper-time variation defines the Thermodynamic Acceleration, which results in an Unruh-like thermal spectrum. To leading order, the Thermodynamic Unruh temperature is frame-independent and universal across out-of-equilibrium relativistic fluid descriptions, from Israel-Stewart to modern theories.</description>

Abstract: The cosmic time dependencies of $G$, $\alpha$, $\hbar$ and of Standard Model parameters like the Higgs vev and elementary particle masses are studied in the framework of a new dark energy interpretation. Due to the associated time variation of rulers, many effects turn out to be invisible. However, a rather large time dependence is claimed to arise in association with dark energy measurements, and smaller ones in connection with the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Conservation Laws and the Quantization of Gravity</title>

Abstract: Adopting general frameworks for quantum-classical dynamics, we analyze the interaction between quantum matter and a classical gravitational field. We point out that, assuming conservation of momentum or energy, and assuming that the dynamics obeys Hamiltonian formalism or a particular decomposition property set out in the paper, the classical gravitational field cannot change the momentum or energy of the quantum system, whereas the quantum gravitational field can do so. Drawing upon the fundamental relationship between conservation laws and the quantum properties of objects, our analysis offers new perspectives for the study of quantum gravity and provides a novel interpretation of existing experimental observations, such as free fall.</description>

      <title>Topics in Weyl Geometry and Quantum Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

      <title>Quantum scalar field theory on equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the canonical quantization of a massive scalar field on a five dimensional, rotating black hole space-time. We focus on the case where the space-time is asymptotically anti-de Sitter and the black hole's two angular momentum parameters are equal. In this situation the geometry possesses additional symmetries which simplify both the mode solutions of the scalar field equation and the stress-energy tensor. When the angular momentum of the black hole is sufficiently small that there is no speed-of-light surface, there exists a Killing vector which is time-like in the region exterior to the event horizon. In this case classical superradiance is absent and we construct analogues of the usual Boulware and Hartle-Hawking quantum states for the quantum scalar field. We compute the differences in expectation values of the square of the quantum scalar field operator and the stress-energy tensor operator between these two quantum states.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.</description>

      <title>Multiply quantized vortex spectroscopy in a quantum fluid of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However, here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We observe generic features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the study of generic amplification phenomena.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Corrections to Thermodynamics of Accelerating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As pointed out in recent research, the near extremal black hole entropy with one-loop effect exhibits universal $\log T$ behaviour at sufficiently low temperature. In this paper, we discuss the low temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Fermionisation of the Aharonov--Bohm Phase on the Lightfront</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the phase space of the Maxwell field as a simplified framework to study the quantisation of holonomies (Wilson line operators) on lightlike (null) surfaces. Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.</description>
