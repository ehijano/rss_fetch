      <title>Limits on Stellar Flybys in the Solar Birth Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbits of small bodies in the outer solar system are particularly sensitive to gravitational perturbations, including stellar flybys. Stellar clusters, with low velocity dispersions and high number densities, can be the source of strong and frequent flybys. As a result, we can infer what properties of the solar birth environment would be incompatible with the structure of the outer solar system observed today. Here, we explore with $n-$body simulations the implications of the low inclinations ($i &lt; 20^{\circ}$) of the distant sednoids (objects with perihelia $q &gt; 40 \mathrm{\; AU}$ and semimajor axes $a &gt; 400 \mathrm{\; AU}$) for the properties of the solar birth cluster. We find that the existence of these orbits, if they were in place in the Sun's birth cluster phase, would limit the product of the stellar number density and the Sun's residence time in the birth cluster to $\lesssim 5 \times 10^3 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$, as compared to the weaker limit $\lesssim 5 \times 10^4 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$ implied by the low inclinations of the cold classical Kuiper belt.</description>

      <title>Radiation Hydrodynamics of Self-gravitating Protoplanetary Disks: I. Direct Formation of Gas Giants via Disk Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational instability (GI) has long been considered a viable pathway for giant planet formation in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), especially at wide orbital separations or around low-mass stars where core accretion faces significant challenges. However, a primary drawback is that disk fragmentation from GI was generally found to produce over-massive clumps, typically in the mass range of brown dwarfs, although most numerical studies adopted simplified cooling prescriptions or with limited numerical resolution. We conduct a suite of global three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of self-gravitating PPDs using the meshless finite-mass (MFM) method. By implementing radiation transport via the M1 closure and systematically varying disk mass and opacity, we show that increasing disk mass and lowering opacity promote fragmentation by enhancing radiative cooling. Non-fragmenting disks settle into a gravito-turbulent state with low-order spiral structures and effective angular momentum transport characterized by $\alpha \sim \beta_\mathrm{cool}^{-1}$. In fragmenting disks, a subset of gravitationally bound clumps survives as long-lived fragments. Their initial masses form a consistent distribution around $\Sigma \cdot\lambda_\mathrm{T} \cdot 2 (c_s/\Omega_\mathrm{K})$ (with $\lambda_T$ the Toomre wavelength), corresponding to $\sim 0.3 - 10\,M_\mathrm{J}$ in our simulations, consistent with being gas giants. These results demonstrate that GI can produce planet-mass fragments under more realistic conditions, reinforcing it as a viable gas giant formation pathway and motivating further studies of fragment evolution and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Pristine ices in a planet-forming disk revealed by heavy water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water is essential to our understanding of the planet-formation process and habitability on Earth. Although trace amounts of water are seen across all phases of star and planet formation, the bulk of the water reservoir often goes undetected, hiding crucial parts of its journey from giant molecular clouds to planets. This raises the question of whether water molecules in comets and (exo-)planets is largely inherited from the interstellar medium or if the water molecules are destroyed and then reformed in the disk. Water isotopologue ratios involving doubly deuterated water (D$_2$O) are a sensitive tracer to answer this question. We present strong evidence of inheritance through an enhancement of D$_2$O in the outbursting V883 Ori disk. The high D$_2$O/H$_2$O ratio of $(3.2 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-5}$ is consistent with values seen in protostellar envelopes and a comet and is two orders of magnitude higher than expected if water is reprocessed. The high deuteration of the heaviest isotopologues D$_2$O/HDO = $(2.3 \pm 1.0) \times $HDO/H$_2$O further establishes the inheritance of water. We conclude that water ice in disks originates from the earliest phases of star formation, providing the missing link between cold dark clouds and (exo-)comets.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Nearby Habitable Zone Super-Earth Candidate Amenable to Direct Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of GJ 251 c, a candidate super-Earth orbiting in the Habitable Zone (HZ) of its M dwarf host star. Using high-precision Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID RVs, in conjunction with archival RVs from the Keck I High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), the Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrograph (CARMENES), and the SPectropolarim\`etre InfraROUge (SPIRou), we improve the measured parameters of the known planet, GJ 251 b ($P_{b}$ = 14.2370 days; $m \sin(i)$ = 3.85$^{+0.35}_{-0.33}$ M$_{\oplus}$), and we significantly constrain the minimum mass of GJ 251 c, placing it in a plausibly terrestrial regime (P$_{c}$ = 53.647 $\pm$ 0.044 days; $ m \sin i_{c}$ = 3.84 $\pm$ 0.75 M$_{\oplus}$). Using activity mitigation techniques that leverage chromatic information content, we perform a color-dependent analysis of the system and a detailed comparison of more than 50 models that describe the nature of the planets and stellar activity in the system. Due to GJ 251's proximity to Earth (5.5 pc), next generation, thirty meter class telescopes will likely be able to image terrestrial planets in GJ 251's HZ. In fact, GJ 251 c is currently the best candidate for terrestrial, HZ planet imaging in the Northern Sky.</description>

      <title>The late formation of chondrites as a consequence of Jupiter-induced gaps and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion ages of the first planetesimals-the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites-suggest they formed within the first 0.5-1 Myr of Solar System history. Yet, planetesimal formation appears to have occurred in at least two distinct phases. A temporal offset separates early-forming bodies from later-forming chondrite parent bodies, which accreted 2-3 Myr after the Solar System onset - an unresolved aspect of Solar System formation. Here we use numerical simulations to show that Jupiter's early formation reshaped its natal protoplanetary disk. Jupiter's rapid growth depleted the inner disk gas and generated pressure bumps and dust traps that manifested as rings. These structures caused dust to accumulate and led to a second-generation planetesimal population, with ages matching those of non-carbonaceous chondrites. Meanwhile, the evolving gas structure suppressed terrestrial embryos' inward migration, preventing them from reaching the innermost regions. Jupiter likely played a key role in shaping the inner Solar System, consistent with structures observed in Class II and transition disks.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Near-Resonant and Metastable States of Young Multi-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the incidence of near-resonant planets declines as planetary systems age, making young planetary systems key signposts of early dynamical evolution. Here we investigate the dynamical states of three of the youngest multi-transiting planetary systems: AU Mic (3-planet, $\sim$20-Myr-old), V1298 Tau (4-planet, $\sim$23-Myr-old), and TOI-2076 (4-planet, $\sim$200-Myr-old). We find that most planet pairs in these systems lie near resonance with circulating rather than librating resonant angles. As a result, they are more susceptible to dynamical chaos than systems that are either securely locked in resonance or far removed from it. Even modest eccentricities of 0.04 to 0.08 may drive them to instability on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Moreover, the observed orbital architectures are vulnerable to eccentricity excitation through mechanisms such as divergent resonance crossing triggered by planetesimal scattering. The observed near-resonant state may represent a transitional phase between a librating resonant chains and a mature non-resonant planetary system. Finally, we briefly discuss mechanisms that could give rise to the observed near-resonant configurations, including overstable libration, disk turbulence, and receding disk inner edge.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Debris Disk Around TWA 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a debris disk surrounding the M3 star, TWA 20, revealed by JWST coronagraphic observations using the Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam). With reference-star differential imaging (RDI), we resolve the disk in scattered light in the F200W filter at a high signal-to-noise ratio and in the F444W filter at a low signal-to-noise ratio. The disk morphology and orientation are characterized via a forward modeling approach, where we determine a radius of 64.7-6.5+6.2 AU and an inclination of 70.1-3.3+2.5 deg. Utilizing our forward model, we improve the fidelity of the debris disk image using model-constrained RDI (MCRDI). The newly discovered disk is one of only 6 disks detected in scattered light that orbit M dwarf stars; it is the third largest of the 6 resolved M dwarf disks and orbits the third faintest host star. The detection of this disk exemplifies the sensitivity of JWST to debris disks around low-luminosity host stars, which have historically been difficult to detect because these disks are cool and dim. We identify a nebulous structure that cannot be explained by an axisymmetric disk. A search for companions in the TWA 20 system yields no candidates.</description>

      <title>3D analytical theory of the perturbed single-synchronous state. Application to the post-impact Didymos-Dimorphos system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the 3D generalization of the planar analytical theory presented in Gaitanas et. al., 2024, which deals with states slightly perturbed from the exact `single-synchronous equilibrium state' (SSES) of the full two-body problem. The SSES corresponds to two non-spherical gravitationally interacting bodies, settled in nearly circular relative orbit, with rotation axes normal to the orbital plane, rapid rotation of the primary and synchronous rotation of the secondary. In the present paper we remove all simplifying assumptions of our previous work Gaitanas et. al., 2024, and show how to compute analytical solutions describing a 3-dimensional perturbation of the system from the SSES in the framework of two distinct theories, called `linear' and `nonlinear'. Linear theory stems from averaging the equations of motion over the primary's rapid rotation angle. This maps the SSES to an equilibrium point of the averaged system, around which analytical solutions can be computed by linearization of the equations of motion. In nonlinear theory, instead, we compute a high order normal form for the Hamiltonian of motion through a sequence of canonical transformations in the form of series. Resonances between the basic system's frequencies appear in the nonlinear theory as small divisors. We show that, close to resonances, the nonlinear theory leads to a partially integrable model, sufficient to analytically describe the evolution of the relative orbit, but only of some of the Euler angles of the system. As a basic application, we compute analytical solutions representing various possible Didymos-Dimorphos post-impact orbital and rotational states. In this case, all analytical formulas here proposed are of direct utility in fitting algorithms exploiting available time series of post-impact observational data.}}</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Parameterization of Non-Orographic Gravity Waves Induced Mixing for Mars Planetary Climate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a formalism of mixing induced by non-orographic gravity waves (GWs) to integrate with the stochastic GWs scheme in the Mars Planetary Climate Model. We derive the formalism of GWs and their mixing under the same assumptions, integrating the two schemes within a unified framework. Specifically, a surface-to-exosphere parameterization of GW-induced turbulence has been derived in terms of the eddy diffusion coefficient. Simulations show that the coefficient is on the order of 1E4 to 1E9 cm2 s-1 and a turbopause is at altitudes of 70 to 140 km, varying with seasons. The triggered mixing has minor effects on model temperatures, yet it substantially impacts upper atmospheric abundances. Simulations are consistent with observations from the Mars Climate Sounder and the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer. Mixing enhances the tracer transports in the middle and upper atmosphere, governing the dynamics of these regions. The scheme reveals how non-orographic GW-induced turbulence can regulate upper atmospheric processes, such as tracer escape.</description>

      <title>Addressing wavelength-correlated systematics in exoplanet transmission spectroscopy: a 2D Gaussian Process approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based transmission spectroscopy is often dominated by systematics, which obstructs our ability to leverage the advantages of larger aperture sizes compared to space-based observations. These systematics could be time-correlated, uniform across all spectroscopic light curves, or wavelength-correlated, which could significantly affect the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Gaussian Processes were introduced in transmission spectroscopy by Gibson et al. (2012) to model correlated systematics in a non-parametric way. The technique uses auxiliary information about the observation and independently fits each spectroscopic light curve to provide robust atmospheric retrievals. However, this method assumes that the uncertainties in the transmission spectrum are uncorrelated in wavelength, which can cause discrepancies and degrade the precision of atmospheric retrievals. To address this limitation, we explore a 2D GP framework formulated by Fortune et al. (2024) to simultaneously model time- and wavelength-correlated systematics. We present its application to ground-based observations of TOI-4153b obtained using the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). As we move towards detecting smaller and cooler planets, developing new methods to address complex systematics becomes increasingly essential.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Echelle Spectroscopy for Solar System Planets: A Planet-as-Point-Source Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has proven to be an effective technique for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. However, transmission spectroscopy requires planetary transits, which occur for only a small fraction of planetary systems due to geometric alignment constraints; hence, characterizing exoplanets through their reflected spectrum of host stars will be helpful for a large number of exoplanets. The upcoming extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will be able to study the reflected spectra of exoplanets. Here, we present a preliminary optical design and a detailed throughput analysis of the instrumentation that interfaces the 2.34 m Vainu Bappu Telescope prime focus to an existing high-resolution echelle spectrograph with disk-integrated light from solar system objects. One of the primary objectives is to obtain high-resolution, high signal-to-noise reflected spectra from the solar system objects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical environment and stability around Centaur (2060) Chiron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent stellar occultation revealed that the Centaur (2060) Chiron hosts a broad disk extending beyond ~200 km from its centre, embedding three ring-like structures (Chi1R, Chi2R, and Chi3R), while a tenuous outer ring (Chi4R) lies beyond the Roche limit. Here, we present a first dynamical assessment of the system's stability through numerical simulations of test particles, accounting for Chiron's triaxial figure. For an equatorial ellipticity of C22~0.02, as inferred from the most recent shape estimates, our simulations reveal a chaotic inner zone extending to ~260 km, where particle lifetimes reach up to a year, while particles beyond ~260 km can remain stable for at least a decade. These results suggest that the innermost portion of the disk is ephemeral and can only persist if continuously replenished. For lower ellipticity values (C22&lt;0.012), however, the entire disk is located within the stable region, regardless of Chiron's mass. Under the physical parameters currently available in the literature, Chi2R is possibly linked to the 1:3 spin-orbit resonance, while Chi1R cannot be linked to the 1:2 resonance, as previously proposed, since this resonance is unstable. Instead, Chi1R and Chi3R may be associated with the 2:5 and 1:5 spin-orbit resonances, respectively. Both the 1:3 and 1:5 resonances are bifurcated, generating chaotic zones that may explain the gap in Chi2R and the longitudinal asymmetry observed in Chi3R.</description>

      <title>Early Evidence for Polar Orbits of Sub-Saturns Around Hot Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Saturns have been reported to preferentially occupy near-polar orbits, but this conclusion has so far been based primarily on systems with cool host stars; obliquity measurements for sub-Saturns orbiting hot stars remain scarce. Expanding the census into the hot-star regime is essential to test whether the polar preference persists across the Kraft break and to diagnose the underlying excitation mechanisms. In this work, we present Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of TOI-1135 b, a sub-Saturn orbiting a hot star with $T_{\rm eff}=6320\pm120$ K, using WIYN/NEID. We confirm its near-polar architecture, measuring a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda=-68.1^{+7.5}_{-5.3}$ degrees and a true obliquity of $\psi=72.2^{+6.4}_{-6.6}$ degrees. Coupling our new measurement with stellar-obliquity data from the literature, we find that sub-Saturns and hot Jupiters around cool stars are unlikely to be drawn from the same parent distribution at the $5.2\sigma$ level, consistent with weaker tidal realignment induced by lower-mass planets. Of the two known misaligned sub-Saturns around hot stars, both are near-polar, suggesting that the polar preference may extend above the Kraft break. Moreover, their obliquities lie near $\sim 65$ degrees, supporting predictions from secular resonance crossing for sub-Saturns around rapidly rotating hot stars.</description>

      <title>The impact of stellar winds and tidal locking effects on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets around M dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an assessment of the effects of stellar wind magnetic and mechanical components on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting the inner and outer radii of the habitable zone (HZ) of M dwarfs. We consider stars with masses in the range of $0.09 - 0.75 M_\odot$ and planets with a surface dipolar magnetic field of 0.5 G. We estimate the size of the magnetospheres of such exoplanets using the pressure balance equation including the contribution of magnetic and ram pressures from stellar winds. We explore different scenarios, including fast and slow stellar winds, to assess the relevance of kinetic contribution. Furthermore, the effect of tidal locking and potential deviations from the Parker spiral, typically used to describe the interplanetary magnetic field, are analyzed. We show that for low mass stars ($M &lt; 0.15 M_\odot$), the ram pressure exerted by stellar winds affects the size of the magnetosphere more than the stellar wind magnetic pressure. Interestingly, when the ram pressure is not much stronger than the magnetic pressure, typically for higher mass stars, the inclusion of ram pressure can be beneficial to the magnetosphere due to the magnetopause currents. A magnetosphere with the size of that of modern Earth is difficult to achieve with the current assumptions. However, an early Earth magnetosphere is achieved by roughly half of our hypothetical planets orbiting the outer radius of the HZ in most of the considered cases. We find that deviations from the Parker spiral can affect the results significantly, reducing the magnetosphere by $56\%$ in extreme cases. Most of the hypothetical planets are most likely (or might be) tidally locked, with the notable exception of those orbiting the outer HZ of GJ 846 and V1005 Ori.</description>

      <title>Simulations of multiple dust ring formation in a subsolar-metallicity protoplanetary disk</title>

Abstract: Super-Earths exist around subsolar-metallicity host stars with a frequency comparable to that around solar-metallicity stars, suggesting efficient assembly of dust grains even in metal-deficient environments. In this study, we propose a pathway for the formation of multiple dust rings that will promote planetesimal formation in a subsolar-metallicity disk. We investigate the long-term evolution of a circumstellar disk with 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ over 750 kyr from its formation stage using two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations. The motion of dust grains is solved separately from the gas, incorporating dust growth and self-consistent radial drift. The disk is initially gravitationally unstable and undergoes intense fragmentation. By 300 kyr, it tends toward a stable state, leaving a single gravitationally bound clump. This clump generates tightly wound spiral arms through its orbital motion. After the clump dissipates at $\sim$410 kyr, the spiral arms transition into axisymmetric substructures under the influence of viscosity. These axisymmetric substructures create local gas pressure bumps that halt the inward radial drift of dust grains, resulting in the formation of multiple-ring-shaped dust distributions. We observe several rings within $\simeq$200 au of the central star, with separations between them on the order of $\sim$10 au, and dust surface density contrasts with inter-ring gaps by factors of $\sim$10-100. We also demonstrate that turbulent viscosities at observationally suggested levels are essential for converting spiral arms into axisymmetric substructures. We speculate that the physical conditions in the dust rings may be conducive to the development of streaming instability and planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XX. Constraining the Chemical Tracers of Young Protostellar Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the formation of planets in protoplanetary disks begins early in the embedded Class 0/I phases of protostellar evolution. The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1", 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)". Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.</description>

      <title>Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee: Final Report and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundances in the disk around T Chamaeleontis (T Cha): PAH sizes, ionization fraction, and mass during JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The T Tauri star T Cha is known to have a protoplanetary disk with a dust gap separating the inner and outer disk regions. The mid-infrared JWST spectrum of T Cha shows multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include PAH dust grains, which are stochastically heated, in our model calculations to simulate the AIBs. Thus, we estimate the PAH abundances from our modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located within the outer disk in our model. Given our best fiducial model, we estimate a population of small PAHs of &lt;26 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of $\sim0.15$. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of ~7$\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to ~17% of the PAH-to-dust mass ratio observed in the ISM. We predict the outer disk to have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains, sizes limited up to $\mu$m-order, in order to properly fit the continuum slope within 14-25 $\mu$m. We propose a possibility of sub-micron dust grains within the gap to justify an observed plateau around ~10 $\mu$m in the JWST spectrum.</description>
