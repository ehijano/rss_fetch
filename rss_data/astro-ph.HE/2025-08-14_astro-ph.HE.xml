      <title>Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: scalar versus pseudoscalar cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of the lobes of radio galaxies VI. Polarimetric simulations of universal pressure profile cluster atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a polarization study based upon relativistic magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR), as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Optical polarization properties of the closest tidal disruption event AT 2023clx indicate origin from tidal stream shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization observations of tidal disruption events offer unique insights into the accretion processes around supermassive black holes. Here, we present optical polarization observations of the nearby event AT 2023clx, obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations reveal a rise and subsequent decay in the polarization degree, temporally offset from the peak of the optical light curve, reaching maximum intrinsic polarization degree of $\sim$5 per cent. In addition, the polarization angle shifts by $\sim60^\circ-100^\circ$ between 6 to 20 days after the optical peak, remaining stable thereafter. Remarkably, the observed polarization variability closely resembles that of AT 2020mot, strongly suggesting a common mechanism for accretion disk formation in these events. The variability in both polarization degree and angle supports models in which tidal stream shocks drive the optical outburst during the accretion disk formation.</description>

      <title>Impact of thermal effects on prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of the remnant following the merger of two neutron stars initially on quasicircular orbits depends primarily on the mass of the initial neutron stars, the mass ratio, and the still-uncertain dense-matter equation of state (EoS). Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature EoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the characteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place either with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse scenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering the threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the uncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the threshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs, combined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS, we find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the thermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal properties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass, i.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the bounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at supranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest differences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk mass as a result.</description>

      <title>Complex Ionization and Velocity Structures in GX 340+0 X-ray Binary Revealed by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first high-resolution XRISM spectrum of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 340+0, revealing unprecedented detail in its emission and absorption features. The spectrum reveals a rich and complex Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line profile and a P-Cygni profile from Ca XX. We use the state-of-the-art spectral synthesis code Cloudy to model the emission and absorption features in detail. Our analysis reveals multi-ionization and multi-velocity structures, where the combination of broad ($\sim$ 800 km/s) and narrow ($\sim$ 360 km/s) line components, along with rest-frame and blueshifted emission and absorption lines, accounts for the observed line profile complexity. We identify a modest $\sim$ 2735 km/s accretion disk wind exhibiting both absorption and emission features. We also detect a relativistic reflection feature in the spectrum, which we model using relxillNS - specifically designed to characterize X-ray reprocessing in accretion disks around neutron stars. Furthermore, we examine the detailed physics of the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ complex, focusing on the forbidden-to-resonance line ratio under the influence of continuum pumping and optical depth effects.</description>

      <title>AT2022sxl: A Candidate Repeating Tidal Disruption Event in Possible Association with Two High-Energy Neutrino Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a candidate repeating tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2022sxl, found from large-field optical survey data. Two flares with a separation time of $\sim$7.2\,yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related mid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of $\sim$200\,day are also seen. We analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, onenear the optical peak of the second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23 and the TDE event, probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and He~I $\lambda$5876. More interestingly, we find that two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory, match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR flare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR emission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.</description>

      <title>New Metrics for Identifying Variables and Transients in Large Astronomical Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key science goal of large sky surveys such as those conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the identification of variable and transient objects. One approach is the statistical analysis of the time series of the changing brightness of sources, that is, their light curves. However, finding adequate statistical representations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues such as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance factors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects that a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric assumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a Gaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve variability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions about the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a range of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint distribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and transient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394 radio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two variability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely $\eta_\nu$ and $V_\nu$, and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and interpretability. Finally, we conduct a rudimentary search for transient sources in the ThunderKAT dataset to demonstrate how our approach might be used as an initial screening tool. Computational notebooks in Python and R are available to help facilitate the deployment of this framework to other surveys.</description>

      <title>Linear Polarization in a Black Hole, 4U~1957+115 and its X-ray Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new spectro-polarimetric method for estimation of the inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by Sunyaev \&amp; Titarchuk (1985, ST85). The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed that the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\tau_0$, in particular for $\tau_0 &gt;$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\sim 2\%$ was found (Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\tau_0$ and then to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ and the plasma temperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using data from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with $\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\Gamma$ with the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at $\Gamma\sim3$ for high $\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: $M_{1957}=4.8 \pm 1.8~M_{\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.</description>

      <title>Cooling of dark neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps, together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter fraction. The related parameter space is scanned for the stellar structural and cooling properties. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps. but no neutron 3P2 pairing. Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius and maximum mass. Possible signals of a large dark matter content could be a very massive but slow-cooling star or a very light but fast-cooling star.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Neutron Stars in Starobinsky Gravity with Causal Hybrid Stellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar structure of neutron stars in the framework of Starobinsky gravity, characterized by a quadratic correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$. In order to {\em preserve causality throughout\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for the stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark matter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of hadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20, and BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with static spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of state. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar remains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond 50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid equations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from the extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which also contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM mass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface. Nevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density and mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically. Notably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with the Starobinsky parameter $\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model supporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \, M_\odot$ for $\alpha = 10\,r_g^2$. This theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating configuration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \, M_\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by approximately 20--25\%.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Physics with Pulsars around Sagittarius A$^\star$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for radio pulsars orbiting around the Galactic centre black hole (BH), Sagittarius A$^\star$ (Sgr A$^\star$), represents a holy grail goal for large-area radio telescopes, in particular for the Square Kilometre Array. Follow-up timing observation of such a PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ binary system with an orbital period $\lesssim O(1\,{\rm year})$ will bring forward a handful of new tests on different aspects of fundamental physics that are barely accessible with other means. However, mass perturbation in the Galactic centre harms the gravitational cleanness of PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ systems. In order to flexibly account for perturbations, a numerical pulsar timing model is gradually being built, which can be used to probe the spacetime around Sgr A$^\star$ BH and study the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Multi-TeV Gamma Rays from GRB 221009A: Challenges for Emission Mechanisms, EBL Opacity, and Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gamma-ray burst GRB~221009A has attracted significant attention due to its record brightness and the first-ever detection of multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays from a GRB. Located at redshift $z=0.151$, this event is relatively nearby by GRB standards yet remains cosmologically distant, making the survival of multi-TeV photons surprising. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory detected photons with energies up to $\sim 13$~TeV during the early afterglow phase, challenging standard EBL models. We investigate whether several theoretical frameworks can explain this anomalous emission: reduced EBL opacity due to cosmic voids along the line of sight, novel emission mechanisms within the GRB environment, secondary $\gamma$-ray production through cosmic-ray cascades, and new-physics scenarios involving Lorentz-invariance violation or axion-like particles. Our analysis highlights the exceptional nature of this event and ongoing theoretical tensions about the dominant physical processes. We discuss the limitations of current models and identify specific observational signatures that future multiwavelength and multi-messenger observations could provide to discriminate between competing explanations. Continued study of similar events with next-generation facilities will be crucial for resolving these challenges and advancing our understanding of extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ Exact Calculation of Strongly-Correlated Nucleonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense nucleonic matter is of vital importance for understanding compact stars and inferring the transition into deconfined quark phase. We present the $\textit{ab initio}$ exact calculations of infinite nucleonic matter with the state-of-the-art full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, enabling us to rigorously benchmark many-body methods and assess the degree to which the nucleonic matter is strongly correlated. This method has been numerically testified to exact diagonalization within a small basis. Calculations of nucleonic matter using the chiral nuclear forces reveal that the symmetric nuclear matter is strikingly strongly correlated than expected, raising questions on previous $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of nuclear matter with truncations and offering insights into simultaneous descriptions of finite nuclei and infinite nucleonic matter from first principles.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Radiation-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Luminous Red Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during stellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to illuminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the CEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However, the mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their observed diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account hydrogen recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass stellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\odot$ with a characteristic velocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\odot$ of equatorially concentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of non-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve is composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly shock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and durations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the durations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of the same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of the CBM. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures during the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly compatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the way for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Stingrays in the radio sky: Two unusual diffuse radio relic sources in the direction of the Magellanic Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two extended, low surface brightness radio continuum sources, each consisting of a near-circular body and an extended tail of emission, nicknamed Stingray 1 (ASKAP J0129-5350) and Stingray 2 (ASKAP J0245-5642). Both are found in the direction of the Magellanic Stream (MS) and were discovered in the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey at 944 MHz. We combine the ASKAP data with low-frequency radio observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey (GLEAM) to conduct a radio continuum analysis. We explore both Galactic/near Galactic scenarios, including runaway or circumgalactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and parentless pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), and extragalactic scenarios including radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dying radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, galaxy pairs or groups, head-tail radio galaxies, and Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), as well as the possibility that the morphology is due to a chance alignment. The Stingrays exhibit non-thermal emission with spectral indices of $\alpha$ = -0.89 $\pm$ 0.09 for Stingray 1 and $\alpha$ = -1.77 $\pm$ 0.06 for Stingray 2. We find that none of the proposed scenarios can explain all of the observed properties, however we determine it most likely that their shape is caused by some kind of complex environmental interaction. The most likely scenario from the available data is that of a head-tail radio galaxy, but more data is required for a definitive classification.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing and Hawking spectra of charged black hole under Lorentz violation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-like black hole (RN-like BH) in bumblebee gravity. We calculate the lensing quantities such as deflection angle, radius of the photon sphere, angular separation, relativistic image characteristics, Einstein ring and time delay. By taking the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) like Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1332, NGC 4649 etc. as RN-like BH, we compute the lensing observables and compare with the observables associated with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (RNBH). The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-de Sitter-like (RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and imaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$. It shows the damping rate and the oscillation frequency decrease with increasing $L$ but it has the opposite effect for the increase of $Q$. We further explore the detectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on the detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody factor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability of wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the increase of $Q$. The behaviour of absorption cross section and sparsity of Hawking radiation for different values of $L$ and $Q$ are also analysed graphically.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a Possible Primordial Black Hole Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.</description>

      <title>New TeV-emitting BL Lac candidates from the eROSITA X-ray survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TeV-emitting BL Lac type blazars represent the extreme end of the blazar population. They are characterized by relatively weak jets and radiatively inefficient accretion disks. Particles accelerated in these jets experience fewer radiative losses, allowing them to reach energies beyond the TeV scale and produce TeV gamma-ray emission. The study of TeV blazars is constrained by the limited number of known sources in this category. Currently, only 56 high synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs have been detected at energies above 0.1 TeV. Searches for TeV emission from BL Lacs typically target sources with bright X-ray emission and a synchrotron peak at or above 1 keV. The recently released eRASS catalog by the eROSITA collaboration, which covers half of the sky, represents the deepest X-ray survey in the soft X-ray band to date. Utilizing the eROSITA survey, combined with infrared data from WISE and archival radio observations, we have identified 121 TeV-emitting blazar candidates. Our search introduces selection criteria based on the radio to infrared that remove quasar-like objects that have similar infrared spectra and X-ray fluxes as TeV-emitting BL Lacs. In our search, we find 23 objects that had not been detected in the ROSAT X-ray survey and 11 that have not been previously associated with blazars. The candidates resulting from our search are suitable for follow-up observations with currently operating imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, as well as future facilities like the CTAO Observatory.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of gravitational wave source populations and their progenitors is an endeavor more than eighty years in the making. This is in part due to a wide variety of theoretical uncertainties that must be taken into account when describing how stellar populations evolve over cosmic time to produce double stellar remnant binaries. Population synthesis software has been developed as a means to investigate these uncertainties under a wide variety of physical assumptions and stellar population formation environments. In this chapter we discuss the development history of population synthesis software with a special focus on work aimed at understanding the formation of gravitational wave populations. We detail the assortment of population synthesis tools in use today that simulate GW populations which are born and evolve in different astrophysical environments. We further discuss the GW population rates and features associated with each environment that have been predicted for both ground and space-based GW detectors. We finish with considerations of future work that combines possible constraints from electromagnetic surveys that may provide key findings that break current degeneracies in population synthesis predictions of GW source populations.</description>

      <title>The Ultraviolet Spectra of 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2003fg-like Type Ia supernovae (03fg-like SNe Ia) are rare subtype of SNe Ia, photometrically characterized by broader optical light curves and bluer ultraviolet (UV) colors compared to normal SNe Ia. In this work, we study four 03fg-like SNe Ia using Swift UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) grism observations to understand their unique UV properties and progenitor scenario(s). We report 03fg-like SNe Ia to have similar UV features and elemental compositions as normal SNe Ia, but with higher UV flux relative to optical. Previous studies have suggested that the UV flux levels of normal SNe Ia could be influenced by their progenitor properties, such as metallicity, with metal-poor progenitors producing higher UV flux levels. While 03fg-like SNe were previously reported to occur in low-mass and metal-poor host environments, our analysis indicates that their UV excess cannot be explained by their host-galaxy parameters. Instead, we demonstrate that the addition of a hot blackbody component, likely arising from the interaction with the circumstellar material (CSM), to the normal SN Ia spectrum, can reproduce their distinctive UV excess. This supports the hypothesis that 03fg-like SNe Ia could explode in a CSM-rich environment.</description>

      <title>Hunting Hidden Axion Signals in Pulsar Dispersion Measurements with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In axion models, interactions between axions and electromagnetic waves induce frequency-dependent time delays determined by the axion mass and decay constant. These small delays are difficult to detect, limiting the effectiveness of traditional methods. We compute such delays under realistic radio telescope conditions and identify a prominent dispersive feature near half the axion mass, which appears non-divergent within the limits of observational resolution. Based on this, we develop a machine learning pipeline that achieves 95\% classification accuracy and demonstrates robust detection performance in low signal-to-noise regimes. The method's robustness is confirmed against false positives using both simulated noisy data and real-world, known-null observations. Future improvements in optical clock precision and telescope bandwidth, particularly with instruments such as the Qitai Radio Telescope, may enhance constraints on the axion decay constant by up to four orders of magnitude in the $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV mass range.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>

Abstract: Black holes are the sources of the strongest gravitational fields that can be found today in the Universe and are ideal laboratories for testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In this letter, I show that the possibility of an interstellar mission to send a small spacecraft to the nearest black hole, although very speculative and extremely challenging, is not completely unrealistic. Certainly we do not have the necessary technology today, but it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The mission may last 80-100 years, but we would be able to obtain very valuable information about black holes and General Relativity that might be difficult to obtain in other ways.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons, predicted in scenarios beyond the Standard Model and viable dark matter (DM) candidates, can form superradiant clouds around spinning black holes influencing their dynamics. Using century-long monitored OJ287 supermassive black hole binary we set first DM-independent, dynamical constraints on their masses $\mu = (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV. These dynamical constraints, driven by boson cloud friction, are robust against DM-model uncertainties and offer a novel ultralight boson probe. We show that analogous superradiant dynamics across the cosmic population of supermassive black hole systems could help resolve final-parsec evolution stalling problem and imprint a detectable suppression and break in the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron star crust properties using an ab initio-benchmarked meta-model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the neutron star crust is essential for interpreting multimessenger observations and constraining the nuclear equation of state (EoS). However, standard phenomenological EoS models often rely on heuristic extrapolations in the low-density regime, which are inconsistent with microscopic predictions. In this work, we refine a unified meta-modeling framework for the EoS by incorporating low-density corrections based on energy density functionals constrained by ab initio neutron-matter calculations. Using Bayesian inference to combine information from astrophysical observations, nuclear theory, and experiments, we assess the impact of these corrections on key crustal properties, including the crust-core transition density and pressure, crustal composition, and moment of inertia. The improved model reduces uncertainties in the inner crust and emphasizes the importance of low-density physics in EoS modeling, highlighting the value of integrating both theoretical and observational constraints across densities to robustly describe the EoS. Moreover, the adopted approach can be readily applied to any existing EoS model to provide a solid framework for interpreting upcoming high-precision multimessenger data.</description>

      <title>Further Evidence for a Direct-Collapse Origin of the Supermassive Black Hole at the Center of the Infinity Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained JWST NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim 3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.</description>
