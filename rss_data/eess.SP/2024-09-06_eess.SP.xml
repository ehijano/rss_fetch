      <title>Angular Spread Statistics for 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Mid-Band Frequencies in an Indoor Hotspot Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detailed multipath propagation spatial statistics for next-generation wireless systems operating at lower and upper mid-band frequencies spanning 6--24 GHz. The large-scale spatial characteristics of the wireless channel include Azimuth angular Spread of Departure (ASD) and Zenith angular Spread of Departure (ZSD) of multipath components (MPC) from a transmitter and the Azimuth angular Spread of Arrival (ASA) and Zenith angular Spread of Arrival (ZSA) at a receiver. The angular statistics calculated from measurements were compared with industry-standard 3GPP models, and ASD and ASA values were found to be in close agreement at both 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz. Measured LOS ASD was found larger than 3GPP ASD indicating more diverse MPC departure directions in the azimuth. ZSA and ZSD were observed smaller than the 3GPP modeling results as most multipath arrivals and departures during measurements were recorded at the boresight antenna elevation. The wide angular spreads indicate a multipath-rich spatial propagation at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, showing greater promise for the implementation of MIMO beamforming systems in the mid-band spectrum.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-Learning-Enabled Beam Alignment for Water-Air Direct Optical Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating interests on underwater exploration/reconnaissance applications have motivated high-rate data transmission from underwater to airborne relaying platforms, especially under high-sea scenarios. Thanks to its broad bandwidth and superior confidentiality, Optical wireless communication has become one promising candidate for water-air transmission. However, the optical signals inevitably suffer from deviations when crossing the highly-dynamic water-air interfaces in the absence of relaying ships/buoys. To address the issue, this article proposes one novel beam alignment strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for water-air direct optical wireless communications. Specifically, the dynamic water-air interface is mathematically modeled using sea-wave spectrum analysis, followed by characterization of the propagation channel with ray-tracing techniques. Then the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme is introduced for DRL-based transceiving beam alignment. A logarithm-exponential (LE) nonlinear reward function with respect to the received signal strength is designed for high-resolution rewarding between different actions. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed DRL-based beam alignment scheme.</description>

      <title>Transmit Beamforming Design for ISAC with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a transmit beamforming strategy for the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems enabled by the novel stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) architecture, where the base station (BS) simultaneously performs downlink communication and radar target detection via different beams. To ensure superior dual-function performance simultaneously, we design the multi-layer cascading beamformer by maximizing the sum rate of the users while optimally shaping the normalized beam pattern for detection. A dual-normalized differential gradient descent (D3) algorithm is further proposed to solve the resulting non-convex multi-objective problem (MOP), where gradient differences and dual normalization are employed to ensure a fair trade-off between communication and sensing objectives. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed beamforming design in terms of balancing communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Pick the Largest Margin for Robust Detection of Splicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in splicing detection, practitioners still struggle to fully leverage forensic tools from the literature due to a critical issue: deep learning-based detectors are extremely sensitive to their trained instances. Simple post-processing applied to evaluation images can easily decrease their performances, leading to a lack of confidence in splicing detectors for operational contexts. In this study, we show that a deep splicing detector behaves differently against unknown post-processes for different learned weights, even if it achieves similar performances on a test set from the same distribution as its training one. We connect this observation to the fact that different learnings create different latent spaces separating training samples differently. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between the distributions of latent margins and the ability of the detector to generalize to post-processed images. We thus provide to the practitioner a way to build deep detectors that are more robust than others against post-processing operations, suggesting to train their architecture under different conditions and picking the one maximizing the latent space margin.</description>

      <title>On Using Curved Mirrors to Decrease Shadowing in VLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) complements radio frequency in indoor environments with large wireless data traffic. However, VLC is hindered by dramatic path losses when an opaque object is interposed between the transmitter and the receiver. Prior works propose the use of plane mirrors as optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) to enhance communications through non-line-of-sight links. Plane mirrors rely on their orientation to forward the light to the target user location, which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper studies the potential of curved mirrors as static reflective surfaces to provide a broadening specular reflection that increases the signal coverage in mirror-assisted VLC scenarios. We study the behavior of paraboloid and semi-spherical mirrors and derive the irradiance equations. We provide extensive numerical and analytical results and show that curved mirrors, when developed with proper dimensions, may reduce the shadowing probability to zero, while static plane mirrors of the same size have shadowing probabilities larger than 65%. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio offered by curved mirrors may suffice to provide connectivity to users deployed in the room even when a line-of-sight link blockage occurs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hybrid Beamforming Designs for ELAA Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) is a key candidate technology for the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. Nevertheless, using substantial numbers of antennas to transmit high-frequency signals in ELAA systems significantly exacerbates the near-field effect. Unfortunately, traditional hybrid beamforming schemes are highly vulnerable to ELAA near-field communications. To effectively mitigate severe near-field effect, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture for ELAA systems, in which each antenna is either adaptively connected to one radio frequency (RF) chain for signal transmission or deactivated for power saving. For the case that instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is available during each channel coherence time, a real-time dynamic hybrid beamforming design is developed to maximize the achievable sum rate under the constraints of the constant modulus of phase-shifters (PSs), non-overlapping dynamic connection network and total transmit power. When instantaneous CSI cannot be easily obtained in real-time, we propose a two-timescale dynamic hybrid beamforming design, which optimizes analog beamformer in long-timescale and digital beamformer in short-timescale, with the goal of maximizing ergodic sum-rate under the same constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture and the effectiveness of the developed algorithms for ELAA near-field communications.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Epilepsy Induced by Ischemic Hypoxic Brain Injury and Hypoglycemic Brain Injury using Multilevel Fusion of Data Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study aims to investigate the similarities and differences in the brain damage caused by Hypoxia-Ischemia (HI), Hypoglycemia, and Epilepsy. Hypoglycemia poses a significant challenge in improving glycemic regulation for insulin-treated patients, while HI brain disease in neonates is associated with low oxygen levels. The study examines the possibility of using a combination of medical data and Electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to predict outcomes over a two-year period. The study employs a multilevel fusion of data features to enhance the accuracy of the predictions. Therefore this paper suggests a hybridized classification model for Hypoxia-Ischemia and Hypoglycemia, Epilepsy brain injury (HCM-BI). A Support Vector Machine is applied with clinical details to define the Hypoxia-Ischemia outcomes of each infant. The newborn babies are assessed every two years again to know the neural development results. A selection of four attributes is derived from the Electroencephalography records, and SVM does not get conclusions regarding the classification of diseases. The final feature extraction of the EEG signal is optimized by the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to get the clear health condition of Hypoglycemia and Epilepsy patients. Through monitoring and assessing physical effects resulting from Electroencephalography, The Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is used to extract the test samples with the most log data and to report hypoglycemia and epilepsy Keywords- Hypoxia-Ischemia , Hypoglycemia , Epilepsy , Multilevel Fusion of Data Features , Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) , Support Vector Machine (SVM)</description>

      <title>Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-recurrent conditions caused by incidents are different from recurrent conditions that follow periodic patterns. Existing traffic speed prediction studies are incident-agnostic and use one single model to learn all possible patterns from these drastically diverse conditions. This study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to improve traffic speed prediction under two separate conditions, recurrent and non-recurrent (i.e., with and without incidents). The MoE leverages separate recurrent and non-recurrent expert models (Temporal Fusion Transformers) to capture the distinct patterns of each traffic condition. Additionally, we propose a training pipeline for non-recurrent models to remedy the limited data issues. To train our model, multi-source datasets, including traffic speed, incident reports, and weather data, are integrated and processed to be informative features. Evaluations on a real road network demonstrate that the MoE achieves lower errors compared to other benchmark algorithms. The model predictions are interpreted in terms of temporal dependencies and variable importance in each condition separately to shed light on the differences between recurrent and non-recurrent conditions.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas: Channel Measurement, Modeling, and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since decades ago, multi-antenna has become a key enabling technology in the evolution of wireless communication systems. In contrast to conventional multi-antenna systems that contain antennas at fixed positions, position-flexible antenna systems have been proposed to fully utilize the spatial variation of wireless channels. In this paper, movable antenna (MA) systems are analyzed from channel measurement, modeling, position optimization to performance evaluation. First, a broadband channel measurement system with physical MAs is developed, for which the extremely high movable resolution reaches 0.02 mm. A practical two-ray model is constructed based on the channel measurement for a two-dimensional movable antenna system across 32$\times$32 planar port positions at 300 GHz. In light of the measurement results, spatial-correlated channel models for the two-dimensional MA system are proposed, which are statistically parameterized by the covariance matrix of measured channels. Finally, the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR)-maximized position selection algorithm is proposed, which achieves 99% of the optimal performance. The performance of different MA systems in terms of spectral efficiency are evaluated and compared for both planar and linear MA systems. Extensive results demonstrate the advantage of MAs over fixed-position antennas in coping with the multi-path fading and improving the spectral efficiency by 10% in a 300 GHz measured channel.</description>

      <title>Speaker and Style Disentanglement of Speech Based on Contrastive Predictive Coding Supported Factorized Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech signals encompass various information across multiple levels including content, speaker, and style. Disentanglement of these information, although challenging, is important for applications such as voice conversion. The contrastive predictive coding supported factorized variational autoencoder achieves unsupervised disentanglement of a speech signal into speaker and content embeddings by assuming speaker info to be temporally more stable than content-induced variations. However, this assumption may introduce other temporal stable information into the speaker embeddings, like environment or emotion, which we call style. In this work, we propose a method to further disentangle non-content features into distinct speaker and style features, notably by leveraging readily accessible and well-defined speaker labels without the necessity for style labels. Experimental results validate the proposed method's effectiveness on extracting disentangled features, thereby facilitating speaker, style, or combined speaker-style conversion.</description>

      <title>Inferring Power Grid Information with Power Line Communications: Review and Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency signals were widely studied in the last decade to identify grid and channel conditions in power lines. PLMs operating on the grid's physical layer are capable of transmitting such signals to infer information about the medium. When applied to the electrical grid, one of the key advantages of PLC is its capacity to use signals to provide information about the grid itself. This makes PLC an ideal communication technology for smart grid applications, particularly in the realms of grid monitoring and surveillance. In this paper, we focus on PLC grid information inference and provide several contributions: a classification of PLC-based applications, a review of the relevant literature, and insights to further advance the field. Our research identified contributions addressing PLMs for three main grid information inference applications: topology inference, anomaly detection, and grid cybersecurity. We utilize the outcome of our review to shed light on the current limitations of the research contributions and suggest future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>CSI-Based Cross-Domain Activity Recognition via Zero-Shot Prototypical Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross-domain capability of wireless sensing is currently one of the major challenges on human activity recognition (HAR) based on the channel state information (CSI) of wireless signals. The difficulty of labeling samples from new domains has encouraged the use of few and zero shot strategies. In this context, prototype networks have attracted attention due to their reasonable cross-domain transferability. This paper presents a novel zero-shot prototype recurrent convolutional network that implements a zero-shot learning strategy for HAR via CSI. This method extracts the prototypes from an available source domain to classify unseen and unlabeled data from the target domain for the same or similar classes. The experiments have been developed using three datasets with real measurements, and the results include an inter-datasets evaluation. Overall, the results improve the state of the art and make it a promising solution for cross-domain HAR.</description>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been regarded as the basic model to facilitate deep learning (DL) to revolutionize resource allocation in wireless networks. GNN-based models are shown to be able to learn the structural information about graphs representing the wireless networks to adapt to the time-varying channel state information and dynamics of network topology. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of applying GNNs to optimize wireless networks via answering three fundamental questions, i.e., how to input the wireless network data into GNNs, how to improve the performance of GNNs, and how to evaluate GNNs. Particularly, two graph representations are given to transform wireless network parameters into graph-structured data. Then, we focus on the architecture design of the GNN-based models via introducing the basic message passing as well as model improvement methods including multi-head attention mechanism and residual structure.

      <title>A Comprehensive Design Framework for UE-side and BS-Side RIS Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in emerging communication systems is a fast-growing research field that has recently earned much attention. While implementing RISs near the base station (BS), i.e., BS-side RIS, or user equipment (UE), i.e., UE-side RIS, exhibits optimum performance, understanding the differences between these two deployments in terms of the system design perspective needs to be clarified. Critical design parameters, such as RIS size, phase shift adjustment, control link, and element type (passive/active), require greater clarity across these scenarios. Overlooking the intricacies of such critical design parameters in light of 6G demands endangers practical implementation, widening the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications. In this regard, our study investigates the impact of each RIS deployment strategy on the anticipated 6G requirements and offers tailored RIS design recommendations to fulfill these forward-looking requirements. Through this, we clarify the practical distinctions and propose a comprehensive framework for differentiating between BS-side and UE-side RIS scenarios in terms of their design parameters. Highlighting the unique needs of each and the potential challenges ahead, we aim to fuse the theoretical underpinnings of RIS with tangible implementation considerations, propelling progress in both the academic sphere and the industry.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning for Uplink Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) is introduced as a means to achieve interference cancellation within artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wireless systems. It is observed that interference cancellation with MUL demonstrates $30\%$ improvement in a classification task accuracy in the presence of a corrupted AI model. Accordingly, the necessity for instantaneous channel state information for existing interference source is eliminated and a corrupted latent space with interference noise is cleansed with MUL algorithm, achieving this without the necessity for either retraining or dataset cleansing. A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) served as a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of MUL in mitigating interference within a neural network model. The advantage of the MUL algorithm was determined by evaluating both the probability of interference and the quantity of samples requiring retraining. In a simple signal-to-noise ratio classification task, the comprehensive improvement across various test cases in terms of accuracy demonstrates that MUL exhibits extensive capabilities and limitations, particularly in native AI applications.</description>

      <title>Transfer-based Adversarial Poisoning Attacks for Online (MIMO-)Deep Receviers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the design of wireless receivers using deep neural networks (DNNs), known as deep receivers, has attracted extensive attention for ensuring reliable communication in complex channel environments. To adapt quickly to dynamic channels, online learning has been adopted to update the weights of deep receivers with over-the-air data (e.g., pilots). However, the fragility of neural models and the openness of wireless channels expose these systems to malicious attacks. To this end, understanding these attack methods is essential for robust receiver design. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based adversarial poisoning attack method for online receivers.Without knowledge of the attack target, adversarial perturbations are injected to the pilots, poisoning the online deep receiver and impairing its ability to adapt to dynamic channels and nonlinear effects. In particular, our attack method targets Deep Soft Interference Cancellation (DeepSIC)[1] using online meta-learning. As a classical model-driven deep receiver, DeepSIC incorporates wireless domain knowledge into its architecture. This integration allows it to adapt efficiently to time-varying channels with only a small number of pilots, achieving optimal performance in a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) scenario.The deep receiver in this scenario has a number of applications in the field of wireless communication, which motivates our study of the attack methods targeting it.Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack in simulations on synthetic linear, synthetic nonlinear, static, and COST 2100 channels. Simulation results indicate that the proposed poisoning attack significantly reduces the performance of online receivers in rapidly changing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming for Backscatter Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key technology of next generation wireless communication. Backscatter communication (BackCom) plays an important role for internet of things (IoT). Then the integration of ISAC with BackCom technology enables low-power data transmission while enhancing the system sensing ability, which is expected to provide a potentially revolutionary solution for IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a novel backscatter-ISAC (B-ISAC) system and focus on the joint beamforming design for the system. We formulate the communication and sensing model of the B-ISAC system and derive the metrics of communication and sensing performance respectively, i.e., communication rate and detection probability. We propose a joint beamforming scheme aiming to optimize the communication rate under sensing constraint and power budget. A successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm and an iterative algorithm are developed for solving the complicated non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and associated algorithms. The proposed B-ISAC system has broad application prospect in IoT scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uplink MIMO Detection using Ising Machines: A Multi-Stage Ising Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output~(MIMO) signal detection is central to every state-of-the-art communication system, and enhancements in error performance and computation complexity of MIMO detection would significantly enhance data rate and latency experienced by the users. Theoretically, the optimal MIMO detector is the maximum-likelihood (ML) MIMO detector; however, due to its extremely high complexity, it is not feasible for large real-world communication systems. Over the past few years, algorithms based on physics-inspired Ising solvers, like Coherent Ising machines and Quantum Annealers, have shown significant performance improvements for the MIMO detection problem. However, the current state-of-the-art is limited to low-order modulations or systems with few users. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-stage Ising machine-based MIMO detector that extends the performance gains of physics-inspired computation to Large and Massive MIMO systems with a large number of users and very high modulation schemes~(up to 256-QAM). We enhance our previously proposed delta Ising formulation and develop a heuristic that adaptively optimizes the performance and complexity of our proposed method. We perform extensive micro-benchmarking to optimize several free parameters of the system and evaluate our methods' BER and spectral efficiency for Large and Massive MIMO systems (up to 32 users and 256 QAM modulation).</description>

      <title>Enhanced Uplink Data Detection for Massive MIMO with 1-Bit ADCs: Analysis and Joint Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new analytical framework on the uplink data detection for massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We first characterize the expected values of the soft-estimated symbols (after the linear receiver and prior to the data detection), which are affected by the 1-bit quantization during both the channel estimation and the uplink data transmission. In our analysis, we consider conventional receivers such as maximum ratio combining (MRC), zero forcing, and minimum mean squared error (MMSE), with multiple user equipments (UEs) and correlated Rayleigh fading. Additionally, we design a linear minimum mean dispersion (LMMD) receiver tailored for the data detection with 1-bit ADCs, which exploits the expected values of the soft-estimated symbols previously derived. Then, we propose a joint data detection (JD) strategy that exploits the interdependence among the soft-estimated symbols of the interfering UEs, along with its low-complexity variant. These strategies are compared with the robust maximum likelihood data detection with 1-bit ADCs. Numerical results examining the symbol error rate show that MMSE exhibits a considerable performance gain over MRC, whereas the proposed LMMD receiver significantly outperforms all the conventional receivers. Lastly, the proposed JD and its low-complexity variant provide a significant boost in comparison with the single-UE data detection.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 66%.</description>

      <title>Complex Permittivity Characterization of Low-Loss Dielectric Slabs at Sub-THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a novel method for characterizing the permittivities of low-loss dielectric slabs in sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies, specifically above 100 GHz using a quasi-optical system. The algorithm is introduced with detailed derivations, and the measurement sensitivity is analyzed through simulations. Subsequently, the method's validity is established via simulations, demonstrating high accuracy (error 0.1% for the loss tangent) for a 30 mm thick plate material and relatively lower accuracy (error &lt;5% for the loss tangent) for a 6 mm thick plate material. Notably, this accuracy surpasses that of the approach presented in [1] when the same window width is used to extract signals. Furthermore, a comparison between the permittivities of plexiglass with a 30 mm thickness characterized by the proposed method and the approach in [1] reveals a maximum difference in the dielectric constant of 0.011 and in loss tangent of 0.00071 from 140 to 220 GHz. Finally, the relative complex permittivities of plexiglass at 142.86 GHz obtained by both methods are compared with the reference values provided in [2], exhibiting differences of 0.06 in the dielectric constant.</description>

      <title>Saturation of gas concentration signal of the laser gas sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays it is possible to determine the type of gas with sufficient accuracy when its concentration is less than {10}^{-6} (in units of ppm) fractions using spectroscopic methods (optical, radio engineering, acoustic). Along with this, the value of permissible concentrations of explosive, toxic, harmful to technology and ecology gases is practically important. Known physical experimental studies indicate only a linear dependence of the response of a laser gas sensor at ppm\gtrsim{10}^3. The research methods for ppm\lesssim{10}^3 are based on the processes of combustion, microexplosion, structural and phase transformations and are not always applicable in real practical conditions. The work is devoted to the analysis of experimentally obtained fluctuations caused by a laser beam in a gas in a photodiode (signal receiver) due to its influence not only at the atomic level, but also on the scale of clusters of nanoparticle molecules. The gas concentration is estimated by the fluctuation-dissipation ratio. It is shown that the signal correlator is saturated to a constant value when the quantum (laser photon energy) and thermal (nanoparticle temperature) factors are comparable with an increase in the concentration of the target gas. The critical values of the saturation concentration are determined by the equality of these two factors.</description>
