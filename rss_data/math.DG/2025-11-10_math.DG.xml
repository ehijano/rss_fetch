      <title>Courant algebroid lifts and curved Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Courant algebroid lift, a new construction that takes a Courant algebroid together with a vector bundle connection and produces, when the connection is flat in the image of the anchor, a Courant algebroid. In general, this lift produces a Courant-like structure that we call a curved Courant algebroid. We start by establishing a hierarchy of Courant algebroid properties and their associated structures. In this setting, we introduce curved Courant algebroids, which we show to be related to connections with torsion and curved differential graded Lie algebras. We use this to provide a classification of exact curved Courant algebroids. We show that the Courant algebroid lift of an exact Courant algebroid yields a natural link between the Patterson-Walker metric and generalized geometry. By lifting non-exact Courant algebroids, we establish a relation of these lifts to Lie algebras, Poisson and special complex geometry. Finally, we show that Courant algebroid lifts provide a large class of examples of Courant algebroid actions.</description>

      <title>Three Examples of Graded Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie theory is, beyond any doubt, an absolutely essential part of differential geometry. It is therefore necessary to seek its generalization to $\mathbb{Z}$-graded geometry. In particular, it is vital to construct non-trivial and explicit examples of graded Lie groups and their corresponding graded Lie algebras.
  Three fundamental families of graded Lie groups are developed in this paper: the general linear group associated with any graded vector space, the graded orthogonal group associated with a graded vector space equipped with a metric, and the graded symplectic group associated with a graded vector space equipped with a symplectic form. We provide both a direct geometric construction and a functor-of-points perspective. It is shown that their corresponding Lie algebras are isomorphic to the anticipated subalgebras of the graded Lie algebra of linear endomorphisms. Isomorphisms of graded Lie groups induced by linear isomorphisms, as well as possible applications, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Classification of fractional, singular Yamabe metrics on a twice punctured sphere I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Delaunay metrics form a family of conformally flat, constant fractional Q-curvature metrics on a twice-punctured sphere. They are all (after a M\"obius transformation) rotationally symmetric and periodic, and admit several elegant variational descriptions. We prove that, when s is close to but less than 1, any complete, conformally flat constant Q-curvature metric on a twice-punctured sphere is a Delaunay metric. Along the way, we prove a sharp a priori bound for the conformal factor of these metrics, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>SU(n)-structures through quotient by torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $(X,g,J,\omega)$ is a K\"ahler manifold with an $SU(n+s)$-structure and a Hamiltonian holomorphic action of a compact torus $T^s$, then the usual symplectic quotient $Y$ inherits an $SU(n)$-structure provided the existence of special $1$-forms on $X$, called twist forms. We then give several applications of our results: on complex projective spaces, on cones over Fano K\"ahler-Einstein manifold and on toric $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ bundles. We also study the geometry behind these structures in the case of $n=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives new insights into the class of Generalized Douglas Weyl ($GDW$)-metrics. This projective invariant class of Finsler metrics, contains some well-known Finsler metrics such as Douglas, Weyl and $R$-quadratic metrics. Here, some new sub-classes of $GDW$-metrics are constructed and considered as the explicit Finsler metrics. Many illustrative and interesting examples are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of homogeneous minimal submanifolds in two families of closed Einstein manifolds, the Page space $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ and the Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$, which are equipped with cohomogeneity-one Einstein metrics admitting the isometric action of $SU(2) \times U(1)$ and $U(1) \times U(1) \times SU(2)$ respectively. We determine all the homogeneous, minimal hypersurfaces and explicitly compute the spectrum of their associated stability operators and determine their index.</description>

      <title>On anti-hyperbolicity for hyperk\"ahler varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By restricting to (a linear subspace of) an affine chart in projective space, a complex stably rational or unirational manifold of dimension $m$ is meromorphically dominable by $\mathbb C^m$, i.e., admits a meromorphic dominating map from $\mathbb C^m$. So are varieties that are birational to abelian varieties and Kummer K3 surfaces. G. Buzzard and the second author have shown that elliptic K3 surfaces are holomorphically dominable by $\mathbb C^2$, i.e. admitting a holomorphic map with nontrivial Jacobian. In this paper we explore various examples and criteria for meromorphic and holomorphic dominability by $\mathbb C^m$ of certain hyperk\"ahler manifolds, generalizing some known results about K3 surfaces. Anti-hyperbolicity has several interpretations in the sense of vanishing of the Kobayashi-Royden metrics, admitting dense entire holomorphic curves, or dominating holomorphic or meromorphic maps from the complex affine space of the same dimension.</description>

      <title>On the smooth Lorentzian optimal transport problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we want to establish some general results in the Lorentzian optimal transport theory that have well-known Riemannian counterparts. As a first result, we will provide non-trivial assumptions on the measures to ensure strong (Kantorovich) duality, i.e. the existence of a maximizing pair in the dual optimal transport formulation. We will also show that, under suitable assumptions, optimality of a causal coupling is characterized by $c$-cyclical monotonicity. The second result deals with the regularity of $c$-convex functions and (weak) Kantorovich potentials. We show that, in general, regularity results known in the Riemannian context do not extend to the Lorentzian setting. Under suitable assumptions on the measures, we will prove nevertheless that these (weak) potentials are locally semconvex on an open set of full measure. As our last result, we will prove that, under quite general assumptions, for any two intermediates measures along a displacement interpolation, there exists a $C^{1,1}_{loc}$-regular maximizing pair in the dual formulation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric surgery for flag structures, which are geometric structures locally modelled on the three-dimensional flag space under the action of ${\mathrm{PGL}}_3(\mathbb{R})$. Using such surgeries we provide examples of flag structures, of both uniformizable and non-uniformizable type.</description>

      <title>Reductions of path structures and classification of homogeneous structures in dimension three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that if a path structure has non-vanishing curvature at a point then it has a canonical reduction to a Z/2Z-structure at a neighbourhood of that point (in many cases it has a canonical parallelism). A simple implication of this result is that the automorphism group of a non-flat path structure is of maximal dimension three (a result by Tresse of 1896). We also classify the invariant path structures on three-dimensional Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Criticality, splitting theorems under spectral Ricci bounds and the topology of stable minimal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove general criticality criteria for operators $\Delta + V$ on manifolds with more than one end, where $V$ bounds the Ricci curvature, and a related spectral splitting theorem extending Cheeger-Gromoll's one. Our results give new insight on Li-Wang's theory of manifolds with a weighted Poincar\'e inequality. We apply them to study stable and $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with non-negative bi-Ricci or sectional curvature, in ambient dimension up to $5$ and $6$, respectively. In the special case where the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^4$, we prove that a $1/3$-stable minimal hypersurface must either have one end or be a catenoid, and that proper, $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces with $\delta &gt; 1/3$ must be hyperplanes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that simply connected toric hyperK\"ahler metrics of finite topological type with maximal volume growth are generically quasi-asymptotically conical, which allows us to compute explicitly their reduced $L^2$-cohomology groups. In the asymptotically conical case, we also provide a fine description of the geometry at infinity of their Taub-NUT deformations of order 1 in terms of a compactification by a manifold with corners, which allows us to show that those deformations are of bounded geometry, to estimate their curvature at infinity and their volume growth and to identify uniquely their tangent cone at infinity. In many instances, the dimension of this tangent cone at infinity is strictly smaller than the order of the volume growth. Finally, our methods show that the Taub-NUT deformations of maximal order of the Euclidean metric are quasi-fibered boundary metrics, which allows us to identify uniquely their tangent cone at infinity, to compute their reduced $L^2$ cohomology groups and to prove that Sen's S-duality conjecture holds for centered monopoles of type $(1,1,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct universal local deformations (Kuranishi families) for pairs consisting of a compact complex curve and a meromorphic 1-form.
  Each pair is assumed to be locally planar, a condition which in particular forces the periods of the meromorphic differential to be preserved by local deformations. The hyperelliptic case yields universal local deformations for the spectral data of integrable systems such as simply-periodic solutions of the KdV equation or of the sinh-Gordon equation (cylinders of constant mean curvature). This is the first of two papers in which we shall develop a deformation theory of the spectral curve data of an integrable system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss many surprising implications of a positive answer to a question raised in some cases by Greenberg in the $`70$s and more generally by Shalom in the early $2000$s. We refer to this positive answer as the Greenberg-Shalom hypothesis. This hypothesis then says that any infinite discrete subgroup of a semisimple Lie group with dense commensurator is a lattice in a product of some factors. For some applications it is natural to extend the hypothesis to cover semisimple algebraic groups over other fields as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of the non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this paper, in the bosonic closed sector of string geometry theory, we completely identify the perturbative vacua, which include general string backgrounds in bosonic closed string theory. From fluctuations around these configurations, we derive the path-integrals of perturbative strings on the string backgrounds up to any order.</description>
