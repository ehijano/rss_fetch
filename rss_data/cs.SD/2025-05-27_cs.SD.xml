      <title>Discovering Interpretable Concepts in Large Generative Music Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned implicit theories of the structure of such content through statistical learning alone. This could offer a novel lens on theories of human-generated media. Where these representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord progressions in music), they demonstrate how these can be inferred from statistical regularities. Where they diverge, they highlight potential limits in our theoretical frameworks -- patterns that we may have overlooked but that nonetheless hold significant explanatory power. In this paper, we focus on the specific case of music generators. We introduce a method to discover musical concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features from the residual stream activations of a transformer model. We evaluate this approach by extracting a large set of features and producing an automatic labeling and evaluation pipeline for them. Our results reveal both familiar musical concepts and counterintuitive patterns that lack clear counterparts in existing theories or natural language altogether. Beyond improving model transparency, our work provides a new empirical tool that might help discover organizing principles in ways that have eluded traditional methods of analysis and synthesis.</description>

      <title>ABHINAYA -- A System for Speech Emotion Recognition In Naturalistic Conditions Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) in naturalistic settings remains a challenge due to the intrinsic variability, diverse recording conditions, and class imbalance. As participants in the Interspeech Naturalistic SER Challenge which focused on these complexities, we present Abhinaya, a system integrating speech-based, text-based, and speech-text models. Our approach fine-tunes self-supervised and speech large language models (SLLM) for speech representations, leverages large language models (LLM) for textual context, and employs speech-text modeling with an SLLM to capture nuanced emotional cues. To combat class imbalance, we apply tailored loss functions and generate categorical decisions through majority voting. Despite one model not being fully trained, the Abhinaya system ranked 4th among 166 submissions. Upon completion of training, it achieved state-of-the-art performance among published results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for SER in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>MPE-TTS: Customized Emotion Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech Using Multi-Modal Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech(ZS-TTS) systems generate the unseen speech based on single prompt, such as reference speech or text descriptions, which limits their flexibility. We propose a customized emotion ZS-TTS system based on multi-modal prompt. The system disentangles speech into the content, timbre, emotion and prosody, allowing emotion prompts to be provided as text, image or speech. To extract emotion information from different prompts, we propose a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder. Additionally, we introduce an prosody predictor to fit the distribution of prosody and propose an emotion consistency loss to preserve emotion information in the predicted prosody. A diffusion-based acoustic model is employed to generate the target mel-spectrogram. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our system outperforms existing systems in terms of naturalness and similarity. The samples are available at https://mpetts-demo.github.io/mpetts_demo/.</description>

      <title>Token-Level Logits Matter: A Closer Look at Speech Foundation Models for Ambiguous Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional intelligence in conversational AI is crucial across domains like human-computer interaction. While numerous models have been developed, they often overlook the complexity and ambiguity inherent in human emotions. In the era of large speech foundation models (SFMs), understanding their capability in recognizing ambiguous emotions is essential for the development of next-generation emotion-aware models. This study examines the effectiveness of SFMs in ambiguous emotion recognition. We designed prompts for ambiguous emotion prediction and introduced two novel approaches to infer ambiguous emotion distributions: one analysing generated text responses and the other examining the internal processing of SFMs through token-level logits. Our findings suggest that while SFMs may not consistently generate accurate text responses for ambiguous emotions, they can interpret such emotions at the token level based on prior knowledge, demonstrating robustness across different prompts.</description>

      <title>Learning Emotion-Invariant Speaker Representations for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid progress in speaker verification (SV) technology has been driven by the extraction of speaker representations based on deep learning. However, such representations are still vulnerable to emotion variability. To address this issue, we propose multiple improvements to train speaker encoders to increase emotion robustness. Firstly, we utilize CopyPaste-based data augmentation to gather additional parallel data, which includes different emotional expressions from the same speaker. Secondly, we apply cosine similarity loss to restrict parallel sample pairs and minimize intra-class variation of speaker representations to reduce their correlation with emotional information. Finally, we use emotion-aware masking (EM) based on the speech signal energy on the input parallel samples to further strengthen the speaker representation and make it emotion-invariant. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of these various components. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a relative 19.29\% drop in EER compared to the baseline system.</description>

      <title>Audio Geolocation: A Natural Sounds Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we determine someone's geographic location purely from the sounds they hear? Are acoustic signals enough to localize within a country, state, or even city? We tackle the challenge of global-scale audio geolocation, formalize the problem, and conduct an in-depth analysis with wildlife audio from the iNatSounds dataset. Adopting a vision-inspired approach, we convert audio recordings to spectrograms and benchmark existing image geolocation techniques. We hypothesize that species vocalizations offer strong geolocation cues due to their defined geographic ranges and propose an approach that integrates species range prediction with retrieval-based geolocation. We further evaluate whether geolocation improves when analyzing species-rich recordings or when aggregating across spatiotemporal neighborhoods. Finally, we introduce case studies from movies to explore multimodal geolocation using both audio and visual content. Our work highlights the advantages of integrating audio and visual cues, and sets the stage for future research in audio geolocation.</description>

      <title>Improving Anomalous Sound Detection through Pseudo-anomalous Set Selection and Pseudo-label Utilization under Unlabeled Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses performance degradation in anomalous sound detection (ASD) when neither sufficiently similar machine data nor operational state labels are available. We present an integrated pipeline that combines three complementary components derived from prior work and extends them to the unlabeled ASD setting. First, we adapt an anomaly score based selector to curate external audio data resembling the normal sounds of the target machine. Second, we utilize triplet learning to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, enabling finer classification of operational sounds and detection of subtle anomalies. Third, we employ iterative training to refine both the pseudo-anomalous set selection and pseudo-label assignment, progressively improving detection accuracy. Experiments on the DCASE2022-2024 Task 2 datasets demonstrate that, in unlabeled settings, our approach achieves an average AUC increase of over 6.6 points compared to conventional methods. In labeled settings, incorporating external data from the pseudo-anomalous set further boosts performance. These results highlight the practicality and robustness of our methods in scenarios with scarce machine data and labels, facilitating ASD deployment across diverse industrial settings with minimal annotation effort.</description>

      <title>Serial-OE: Anomalous sound detection based on serial method with outlier exposure capable of using small amounts of anomalous data for training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Serial-OE, a new approach to anomalous sound detection (ASD) that leverages small amounts of anomalous data to improve the performance. Conventional ASD methods rely primarily on the modeling of normal data, due to the cost of collecting anomalous data from various possible types of equipment breakdowns. Our method improves upon existing ASD systems by implementing an outlier exposure framework that utilizes normal and pseudo-anomalous data for training, with the capability to also use small amounts of real anomalous data. A comprehensive evaluation using the DCASE2020 Task2 dataset shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ASD models. We also investigate the impact on performance of using a small amount of anomalous data during training, of using data without machine ID information, and of using contaminated training data. Our experimental results reveal the potential of using a very limited amount of anomalous data during training to address the limitations of existing methods using only normal data for training due to the scarcity of anomalous data. This study contributes to the field by presenting a method that can be dynamically adapted to include anomalous data during the operational phase of an ASD system, paving the way for more accurate ASD.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning method using multiple sampling strategies for general-purpose audio representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning method using multiple sampling strategies to obtain general-purpose audio representation. Multiple sampling strategies are used in the proposed method to construct contrastive losses from different perspectives and learn representations based on them. In this study, in addition to the widely used clip-level sampling strategy, we introduce two new strategies, a frame-level strategy and a task-specific strategy. The proposed multiple strategies improve the performance of frame-level classification and other tasks like pitch detection, which are not the focus of the conventional single clip-level sampling strategy. We pre-trained the method on a subset of Audioset and applied it to a downstream task with frozen weights. The proposed method improved clip classification, sound event detection, and pitch detection performance by 25%, 20%, and 3.6%.</description>

      <title>CloneShield: A Framework for Universal Perturbation Against Zero-Shot Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-speech (TTS) voice cloning have raised serious privacy concerns, allowing highly accurate vocal identity replication from just a few seconds of reference audio, while retaining the speaker's vocal authenticity. In this paper, we introduce CloneShield, a universal time-domain adversarial perturbation framework specifically designed to defend against zero-shot voice cloning. Our method provides protection that is robust across speakers and utterances, without requiring any prior knowledge of the synthesized text. We formulate perturbation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to ensure the robust protection across diverse utterances. To preserve natural auditory perception for users, we decompose the adversarial perturbation via Mel-spectrogram representations and fine-tune it for each sample. This design ensures imperceptibility while maintaining strong degradation effects on zero-shot cloned outputs. Experiments on three state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems, five benchmark datasets and evaluations from 60 human listeners demonstrate that our method preserves near-original audio quality in protected inputs (PESQ = 3.90, SRS = 0.93) while substantially degrading both speaker similarity and speech quality in cloned samples (PESQ = 1.07, SRS = 0.08).</description>

      <title>BR-ASR: Efficient and Scalable Bias Retrieval Framework for Contextual Biasing ASR in Speech LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have advanced standard automatic speech recognition (ASR), contextual biasing for named entities and rare words remains challenging, especially at scale. To address this, we propose BR-ASR: a Bias Retrieval framework for large-scale contextual biasing (up to 200k entries) via two innovations: (1) speech-and-bias contrastive learning to retrieve semantically relevant candidates; (2) dynamic curriculum learning that mitigates homophone confusion which negatively impacts the final performance. The is a general framework that allows seamless integration of the retrieved candidates into diverse ASR systems without fine-tuning. Experiments on LibriSpeech test-clean/-other achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) biased word error rates (B-WER) of 2.8%/7.1% with 2000 bias words, delivering 45% relative improvement over prior methods. BR-ASR also demonstrates high scalability: when expanding the bias list to 200k where traditional methods generally fail, it induces only 0.3 / 2.9% absolute WER / B-WER degradation with a 99.99% pruning rate and only 20ms latency per query on test-other.</description>

      <title>EnvSDD: Benchmarking Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing domains.</description>

      <title>Eta-WavLM: Efficient Speaker Identity Removal in Self-Supervised Speech Representations Using a Simple Linear Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has reduced the reliance on expensive labeling in speech technologies by learning meaningful representations from unannotated data. Since most SSL-based downstream tasks prioritize content information in speech, ideal representations should disentangle content from unwanted variations like speaker characteristics in the SSL representations. However, removing speaker information often degrades other speech components, and existing methods either fail to fully disentangle speaker identity or require resource-intensive models. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled representations. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves speaker independence and as such, when applied to content-driven tasks such as voice conversion, our representations yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Large Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and speech.</description>

      <title>RA-CLAP: Relation-Augmented Emotional Speaking Style Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining For Speech Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model has demonstrated excellent performance in general audio description-related tasks, such as audio retrieval. However, in the emerging field of emotional speaking style description (ESSD), cross-modal contrastive pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel speech retrieval task called emotional speaking style retrieval (ESSR), and ESS-CLAP, an emotional speaking style CLAP model tailored for learning relationship between speech and natural language descriptions. In addition, we further propose relation-augmented CLAP (RA-CLAP) to address the limitation of traditional methods that assume a strict binary relationship between caption and audio. The model leverages self-distillation to learn the potential local matching relationships between speech and descriptions, thereby enhancing generalization ability. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of RA-CLAP, providing valuable reference in ESSD.</description>

      <title>Room Impulse Response as a Prompt for Acoustic Echo Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) methods, predominantly trained on synthetic or constrained real-world datasets, encounter performance declines in unseen echo scenarios, especially in real environments where echo paths are not directly observable. Our proposed method counters this limitation by integrating room impulse response (RIR) as a pivotal training prompt, aiming to improve the generalization of AEC models in such unforeseen conditions. We also explore four RIR prompt fusion methods. Comprehensive evaluations, including both simulated RIR under unknown conditions and recorded RIR in real, demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves performance compared to baseline models. These results substantiate the effectiveness of our RIR-guided approach in strengthening the model's generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation Based on Direction-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is an important speech signal processing technology that can remove echoes from microphone signals to enable natural-sounding full-duplex speech communication. While single-channel AEC is widely adopted, multi-channel AEC can leverage spatial cues afforded by multiple microphones to achieve better performance. Existing multi-channel AEC approaches typically combine beamforming with deep neural networks (DNN). This work proposes a two-stage algorithm that enhances multi-channel AEC by incorporating sound source directional cues. Specifically, a lightweight DNN is first trained to predict the sound source directions, and then the predicted directional information, multi-channel microphone signals, and single-channel far-end signal are jointly fed into an AEC network to estimate the near-end signal. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline approaches and exhibits robust generalization across diverse acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Multi-Step Audio Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio source separation aims to separate a mixture into target sources. Previous audio source separation systems usually conduct one-step inference, which does not fully explore the separation ability of models. In this work, we reveal that pretrained one-step audio source separation models can be leveraged for multi-step separation without additional training. We propose a simple yet effective inference method that iteratively applies separation by optimally blending the input mixture with the previous step's separation result. At each step, we determine the optimal blending ratio by maximizing a metric. We prove that our method always yield improvement over one-step inference, provide error bounds based on model smoothness and metric robustness, and provide theoretical analysis connecting our method to denoising along linear interpolation paths between noise and clean distributions, a property we link to denoising diffusion bridge models. Our approach effectively delivers improved separation performance as a "free lunch" from existing models. Our empirical results demonstrate that our multi-step separation approach consistently outperforms one-step inference across both speech enhancement and music source separation tasks, and can achieve scaling performance similar to training a larger model, using more data, or in some cases employing a multi-step training objective. These improvements appear not only on the optimization metric during multi-step inference, but also extend to nearly all non-optimized metrics (with one exception). We also discuss limitations of our approach and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Decoding Speaker-Normalized Pitch from EEG for Mandarin Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The same speech content produced by different speakers exhibits significant differences in pitch contour, yet listeners' semantic perception remains unaffected. This phenomenon may stem from the brain's perception of pitch contours being independent of individual speakers' pitch ranges. In this work, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to Mandarin monosyllables with varying tones, phonemes, and speakers. The CE-ViViT model is proposed to decode raw or speaker-normalized pitch contours directly from EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can decode pitch contours with modest errors, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEG regression methods. Moreover, speaker-normalized pitch contours were decoded more accurately, supporting the neural encoding of relative pitch.</description>

      <title>STOPA: A Database of Systematic VariaTion Of DeePfake Audio for Open-Set Source Tracing and Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing - determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA, a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights, ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model transparency.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Real-World Assessment of Audio Watermarking Algorithms: Will They Survive Neural Codecs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to foster the evaluation of deep learning-based audio watermarking algorithms, establishing a standardized benchmark and allowing systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline, featuring various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, and propose a diverse test dataset, including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. By assessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our framework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain algorithms. Our contributions strengthen the robustness and perceptual assessment of audio watermarking algorithms across a wide range of applications, while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation approach. The evaluation framework, including the attack pipeline, is accessible at github.com/SonyResearch/wm_robustness_eval.</description>

      <title>Automated evaluation of children's speech fluency for low-resource languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessment of children's speaking fluency in education is well researched for majority languages, but remains highly challenging for low resource languages. This paper proposes a system to automatically assess fluency by combining a fine-tuned multilingual ASR model, an objective metrics extraction stage, and a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) network. The objective metrics include phonetic and word error rates, speech rate, and speech-pause duration ratio. These are interpreted by a GPT-based classifier guided by a small set of human-evaluated ground truth examples, to score fluency. We evaluate the proposed system on a dataset of children's speech in two low-resource languages, Tamil and Malay and compare the classification performance against Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as using ChatGPT-4o to predict fluency directly from speech input. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher accuracy than multimodal GPT or other methods.</description>

      <title>DiEmo-TTS: Disentangled Emotion Representations via Self-Supervised Distillation for Cross-Speaker Emotion Transfer in Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion embeddings.</description>

      <title>EmoSphere-SER: Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Through Spherical Representation with Auxiliary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition predicts a speaker's emotional state from speech signals using discrete labels or continuous dimensions such as arousal, valence, and dominance (VAD). We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Novel Loss-Enhanced Universal Adversarial Patches for Sustainable Speaker Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning voice models are commonly used nowadays, but the safety processing of personal data, such as human identity and speech content, remains suspicious. To prevent malicious user identification, speaker anonymization methods were proposed. Current methods, particularly based on universal adversarial patch (UAP) applications, have drawbacks such as significant degradation of audio quality, decreased speech recognition quality, low transferability across different voice biometrics models, and performance dependence on the input audio length. To mitigate these drawbacks, in this work, we introduce and leverage the novel Exponential Total Variance (TV) loss function and provide experimental evidence that it positively affects UAP strength and imperceptibility. Moreover, we present a novel scalable UAP insertion procedure and demonstrate its uniformly high performance for various audio lengths.</description>

      <title>Towards Video to Piano Music Generation with Chain-of-Perform Support Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate semantic and temporal alignment.However, existing evaluation datasets do not fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1) existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise semantic and temporal alignment between video content and piano audio via step-by-step Chain-of-Perform guidance; (2) a versatile evaluation framework for rigorous assessment of both general-purpose and specialized video-to-piano generation tasks; and (3) full open-sourcing of the dataset, annotations, and evaluation protocols. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/acappemin/Video-to-Audio-and-Piano, with a continuously updated leaderboard to promote ongoing research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Automated data curation for self-supervised learning in underwater acoustic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainability of the ocean ecosystem is threatened by increased levels of sound pollution, making monitoring crucial to understand its variability and impact. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems collect a large amount of underwater sound recordings, but the large volume of data makes manual analysis impossible, creating the need for automation. Although machine learning offers a potential solution, most underwater acoustic recordings are unlabeled. Self-supervised learning models have demonstrated success in learning from large-scale unlabeled data in various domains like computer vision, Natural Language Processing, and audio. However, these models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets for training in order to generalize well. To address this, a fully automated self-supervised data curation pipeline is proposed to create a diverse and balanced dataset from raw PAM data. It integrates Automatic Identification System (AIS) data with recordings from various hydrophones in the U.S. waters. Using hierarchical k-means clustering, the raw audio data is sampled and then combined with AIS samples to create a balanced and diverse dataset. The resulting curated dataset enables the development of self-supervised learning models, facilitating various tasks such as monitoring marine mammals and assessing sound pollution.</description>

      <title>Acoustic and Machine Learning Methods for Speech-Based Suicide Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicide remains a public health challenge, necessitating improved detection methods to facilitate timely intervention and treatment. This systematic review evaluates the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in assessing suicide risk through acoustic analysis of speech. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 33 articles selected from PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. These studies primarily explored acoustic differences between individuals at risk of suicide (RS) and those not at risk (NRS), and evaluated ML classifier performance. Findings consistently showed significant acoustic feature variations between RS and NRS populations, particularly involving jitter, fundamental frequency (F0), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and power spectral density (PSD). Classifier effectiveness varied based on algorithms, modalities, and speech elicitation methods, with multimodal approaches integrating acoustic, linguistic, and metadata features demonstrating superior performance. However, limitations such as methodological variability, small sample sizes, lack of longitudinal data, and limited linguistic and demographic diversity restrict generalizability. Future research should focus on standardizing methods, expanding multimodal analyses, and utilizing larger, diverse datasets to support AI integration in clinical suicide risk assessment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in handling various tasks and modalities. However, adapting these models for general-purpose audio-language tasks is challenging due to differences in acoustic environments and task variations. In this work, we introduce LiSTEN Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs), a framework for adapting LLMs to speech and audio tasks. LiSTEN uses a dynamic prompt selection strategy with learnable key-value pairs, allowing the model to balance general and task-specific knowledge while avoiding overfitting in a multitask setting. Our approach reduces dependence on large-scale ASR or captioning datasets, achieves competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters, and simplifies training by using a single-stage process. Additionally, LiSTEN enhances interpretability by analyzing the diversity and overlap of selected prompts across different tasks.</description>

      <title>MAVL: A Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Dataset for Animated Song Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization of Speech Large Language Models with Multi-Task Behavior Imitation and Speech-Text Interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization across tasks, leading to increased interest in integrating speech with LLMs. These speech LLMs (SLLMs) typically use supervised fine-tuning to align speech with text-based LLMs. However, the lack of annotated speech data across a wide range of tasks hinders alignment efficiency, resulting in poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task 'behavior imitation' method with speech-text interleaving, called MTBI, which relies solely on paired speech and transcripts. By ensuring the LLM decoder generates equivalent responses to paired speech and text, we achieve a more generalized SLLM. Interleaving is used to further enhance alignment efficiency. We introduce a simple benchmark to evaluate prompt and task generalization across different models. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTBI outperforms SOTA SLLMs on both prompt and task generalization, while requiring less supervised speech data.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Usefulness of Non-Diagnostic Speech Data for Developing Parkinson's Disease Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker performance.</description>

      <title>WHISTRESS: Enriching Transcriptions with Sentence Stress Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language conveys meaning not only through words but also through intonation, emotion, and emphasis. Sentence stress, the emphasis placed on specific words within a sentence, is crucial for conveying speaker intent and has been extensively studied in linguistics. In this work, we introduce WHISTRESS, an alignment-free approach for enhancing transcription systems with sentence stress detection. To support this task, we propose TINYSTRESS-15K, a scalable, synthetic training data for the task of sentence stress detection which resulted from a fully automated dataset creation process. We train WHISTRESS on TINYSTRESS-15K and evaluate it against several competitive baselines. Our results show that WHISTRESS outperforms existing methods while requiring no additional input priors during training or inference. Notably, despite being trained on synthetic data, WHISTRESS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across diverse benchmarks.

      <title>SpeakStream: Streaming Text-to-Speech with Interleaved Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latency bottleneck of traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems fundamentally hinders the potential of streaming large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI. These TTS systems, typically trained and inferenced on complete utterances, introduce unacceptable delays, even with optimized inference speeds, when coupled with streaming LLM outputs. This is particularly problematic for creating responsive conversational agents where low first-token latency is critical. In this paper, we present SpeakStream, a streaming TTS system that generates audio incrementally from streaming text using a decoder-only architecture. SpeakStream is trained using a next-step prediction loss on interleaved text-speech data. During inference, it generates speech incrementally while absorbing streaming input text, making it particularly suitable for cascaded conversational AI agents where an LLM streams text to a TTS system. Our experiments demonstrate that SpeakStream achieves state-of-the-art latency results in terms of first-token latency while maintaining the quality of non-streaming TTS systems.</description>

      <title>SoloSpeech: Enhancing Intelligibility and Quality in Target Speech Extraction through a Cascaded Generative Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness, and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments. On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction, reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset, SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>GSA-TTS : Toward Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis based on Gradual Style Adaptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the gradual style adaptor TTS (GSA-TTS) with a novel style encoder that gradually encodes speaking styles from an acoustic reference for zero-shot speech synthesis. GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>VoiceStar: Robust Zero-Shot Autoregressive TTS with Duration Control and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VoiceStar, the first zero-shot TTS model that achieves both output duration control and extrapolation. VoiceStar is an autoregressive encoder-decoder neural codec language model, that leverages a novel Progress-Monitoring Rotary Position Embedding (PM-RoPE) and is trained with Continuation-Prompt Mixed (CPM) training. PM-RoPE enables the model to better align text and speech tokens, indicates the target duration for the generated speech, and also allows the model to generate speech waveforms much longer in duration than those seen during. CPM training also helps to mitigate the training/inference mismatch, and significantly improves the quality of the generated speech in terms of speaker similarity and intelligibility. VoiceStar outperforms or is on par with current state-of-the-art models on short-form benchmarks such as Librispeech and Seed-TTS, and significantly outperforms these models on long-form/extrapolation benchmarks (20-50s) in terms of intelligibility and naturalness.

      <title>Mel-McNet: A Mel-Scale Framework for Online Multichannel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online multichannel speech enhancement has been intensively studied recently. Though Mel-scale frequency is more matched with human auditory perception and computationally efficient than linear frequency, few works are implemented in a Mel-frequency domain. To this end, this work proposes a Mel-scale framework (namely Mel-McNet). It processes spectral and spatial information with two key components: an effective STFT-to-Mel module compressing multi-channel STFT features into Mel-frequency representations, and a modified McNet backbone directly operating in the Mel domain to generate enhanced LogMel spectra. The spectra can be directly fed to vocoders for waveform reconstruction or ASR systems for transcription. Experiments on CHiME-3 show that Mel-McNet can reduce computational complexity by 60% while maintaining comparable enhancement and ASR performance to the original McNet. Mel-McNet also outperforms other SOTA methods, verifying the potential of Mel-scale speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>MFA-KWS: Effective Keyword Spotting with Multi-head Frame-asynchronous Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is essential for voice-driven applications, demanding both accuracy and efficiency. Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion-based Text-to-Speech Model Training with Dual Modality Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to optimize the training process of diffusion-based text-to-speech models. While recent studies have achieved remarkable advancements, their training demands substantial time and computational costs, largely due to the implicit guidance of diffusion models in learning complex intermediate representations. To address this, we propose A-DMA, an effective strategy for Accelerating training with Dual Modality Alignment. Our method introduces a novel alignment pipeline leveraging both text and speech modalities: text-guided alignment, which incorporates contextual representations, and speech-guided alignment, which refines semantic representations. By aligning hidden states with discriminative features, our training scheme reduces the reliance on diffusion models for learning complex representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A-DMA doubles the convergence speed while achieving superior performance over baselines.

      <description>arXiv:2505.19652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech disorders such as dysarthria and anarthria can severely impair the patient's ability to communicate verbally. Speech decoding brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a potential alternative by directly translating speech intentions into spoken words, serving as speech neuroprostheses. This paper reports an experimental protocol for Mandarin Chinese speech decoding BCIs, along with the corresponding decoding algorithms. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and synchronized audio data were collected from eight drug-resistant epilepsy patients as they conducted a word-level reading task. The proposed SEEG and Audio Contrastive Matching (SACM), a contrastive learning-based framework, achieved decoding accuracies significantly exceeding chance levels in both speech detection and speech decoding tasks. Electrode-wise analysis revealed that a single sensorimotor cortex electrode achieved performance comparable to that of the full electrode array. These findings provide valuable insights for developing more accurate online speech decoding BCIs.</description>

      <title>Reshaping Representation Space to Balance the Safety and Over-rejection in Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling audio-based human interactions. However, recent research has revealed that LALMs remain vulnerable to harmful queries due to insufficient safety-alignment. Despite advances in defence measures for text and vision LLMs, effective safety-alignment strategies and audio-safety dataset specifically targeting LALMs are notably absent. Meanwhile defence measures based on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) struggle to address safety improvement while avoiding over-rejection issues, significantly compromising helpfulness. In this work, we propose an unsupervised safety-fine-tuning strategy as remedy that reshapes model's representation space to enhance existing LALMs safety-alignment while balancing the risk of over-rejection. Our experiments, conducted across three generations of Qwen LALMs, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves LALMs safety under three modality input conditions (audio-text, text-only, and audio-only) while increasing over-rejection rate by only 0.88% on average. Warning: this paper contains harmful examples.</description>

      <title>Deep learning based spatial aliasing reduction in beamforming for audio capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial aliasing affects spaced microphone arrays, causing directional ambiguity above certain frequencies, degrading spatial and spectral accuracy of beamformers. Given the limitations of conventional signal processing and the scarcity of deep learning approaches to spatial aliasing mitigation, we propose a novel approach using a U-Net architecture to predict a signal-dependent de-aliasing filter, which reduces aliasing in conventional beamforming for spatial capture. Two types of multichannel filters are considered, one which treats the channels independently and a second one that models cross-channel dependencies. The proposed approach is evaluated in two common spatial capture scenarios: stereo and first-order Ambisonics. The results indicate a very significant improvement, both objective and perceptual, with respect to conventional beamforming. This work shows the potential of deep learning to reduce aliasing in beamforming, leading to improvements in multi-microphone setups.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Flow-Matching-Based Text-to-Speech via Empirically Pruned Step Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-matching-based text-to-speech (TTS) models, such as Voicebox, E2 TTS, and F5-TTS, have attracted significant attention in recent years. These models require multiple sampling steps to reconstruct speech from noise, making inference speed a key challenge. Reducing the number of sampling steps can greatly improve inference efficiency. To this end, we introduce Fast F5-TTS, a training-free approach to accelerate the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. By inspecting the sampling trajectory of F5-TTS, we identify redundant steps and propose Empirically Pruned Step Sampling (EPSS), a non-uniform time-step sampling strategy that effectively reduces the number of sampling steps. Our approach achieves a 7-step generation with an inference RTF of 0.030 on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, making it 4 times faster than the original F5-TTS while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, EPSS performs well on E2 TTS models, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.</description>

      <title>ALAS: Measuring Latent Speech-Text Alignment For Spoken Language Understanding In Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study examines the correlation between audio and text representations across transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across different layers and different tasks.</description>

      <title>DeepDialogue: A Multi-Turn Emotionally-Rich Spoken Dialogue Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have demonstrated impressive capabilities in single-turn responses, yet multi-turn dialogues remain challenging for even the most sophisticated language models. Current dialogue datasets are limited in their emotional range, domain diversity, turn depth, and are predominantly text-only, hindering progress in developing more human-like conversational systems across modalities. To address these limitations, we present DeepDialogue, a large-scale multimodal dataset containing 40,150 high-quality multi-turn dialogues spanning 41 domains and incorporating 20 distinct emotions with coherent emotional progressions. Our approach pairs 9 different language models (4B-72B parameters) to generate 65,600 initial conversations, which we then evaluate through a combination of human annotation and LLM-based quality filtering. The resulting dataset reveals fundamental insights: smaller models fail to maintain coherence beyond 6 dialogue turns; concrete domains (e.g., "cars," "travel") yield more meaningful conversations than abstract ones (e.g., "philosophy"); and cross-model interactions produce more coherent dialogues than same-model conversations. A key contribution of DeepDialogue is its speech component, where we synthesize emotion-consistent voices for all 40,150 dialogues, creating the first large-scale open-source multimodal dialogue dataset that faithfully preserves emotional context across multi-turn conversations.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Emotion Recognition Through Cross Modal Attention Alignment and Balanced Stacking Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion plays a fundamental role in human interaction, and therefore systems capable of identifying emotions in speech are crucial in the context of human-computer interaction. Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a challenging problem, particularly in natural speech and when the available data is imbalanced across emotions. This paper presents our proposed system in the context of the 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions Challenge. Our proposed architecture leverages cross-modality, utilizing cross-modal attention to fuse representations from different modalities. To address class imbalance, we employed two training designs: (i) weighted crossentropy loss (WCE); and (ii) WCE with an additional neutralexpressive soft margin loss and balancing. We trained a total of 12 multimodal models, which were ensembled using a balanced stacking model. Our proposed system achieves a MacroF1 score of 0.4094 and an accuracy of 0.4128 on 8-class speech emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding, reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the development of ALLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of large audio-language models for speech translation remains challenging due to their significant computational requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge through our system submissions to the "Model Compression" track at the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2025). We experiment with a combination of approaches including iterative layer pruning based on layer importance evaluation, low-rank adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), and knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we use Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct for speech translation into German and Chinese. Our pruned (student) models achieve up to a 50% reduction in both model parameters and storage footprint, while retaining 97-100% of the translation quality of the in-domain (teacher) models.</description>

      <title>PITCH: AI-assisted Tagging of Deepfake Audio Calls using Challenge-Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18085v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of AI voice-cloning technology, particularly audio Real-time Deepfakes (RTDFs), has intensified social engineering attacks by enabling real-time voice impersonation that bypasses conventional enrollment-based authentication. This technology represents an existential threat to phone-based authentication systems, while total identity fraud losses reached $43 billion. Unlike traditional robocalls, these personalized AI-generated voice attacks target high-value accounts and circumvent existing defensive measures, creating an urgent cybersecurity challenge. To address this, we propose PITCH, a robust challenge-response method to detect and tag interactive deepfake audio calls. We developed a comprehensive taxonomy of audio challenges based on the human auditory system, linguistics, and environmental factors, yielding 20 prospective challenges. Testing against leading voice-cloning systems using a novel dataset (18,600 original and 1.6 million deepfake samples from 100 users), PITCH's challenges enhanced machine detection capabilities to 88.7% AUROC score, enabling us to identify 10 highly-effective challenges.
  For human evaluation, we filtered a challenging, balanced subset on which human evaluators independently achieved 72.6% accuracy, while machines scored 87.7%. Recognizing that call environments require human control, we developed a novel human-AI collaborative system that tags suspicious calls as "Deepfake-likely." Contrary to prior findings, we discovered that integrating human intuition with machine precision offers complementary advantages, giving users maximum control while boosting detection accuracy to 84.5%. This significant improvement situates PITCH's potential as an AI-assisted pre-screener for verifying calls, offering an adaptable approach to combat real-time voice-cloning attacks while maintaining human decision authority.</description>

      <title>DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12363v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure the reliable operation of speech systems across diverse environments, noise addition methods have emerged as the prevailing solution. However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance. Our implementation and demonstrations are available at https://dgsna.github.io.</description>

      <title>Bridging The Multi-Modality Gaps of Audio, Visual and Linguistic for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) aims to improve the quality and intelligibility of speech in noisy environments. Recent studies have shown that incorporating visual cues in audio signal processing can enhance SE performance. Given that human speech communication naturally involves audio, visual, and linguistic modalities, it is reasonable to expect additional improvements by integrating linguistic information. However, effectively bridging these modality gaps, particularly during knowledge transfer remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework, termed DLAV-SE, which leverages a diffusion-based model integrating audio, visual, and linguistic information for audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE). Within this framework, the linguistic modality is modeled using a pretrained language model (PLM), which transfers linguistic knowledge to the audio-visual domain through a cross-modal knowledge transfer (CMKT) mechanism during training. After training, the PLM is no longer required at inference, as its knowledge is embedded into the AVSE model through the CMKT process. We conduct a series of SE experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that the proposed DLAV-SE system significantly improves speech quality and reduces generative artifacts, such as phonetic confusion, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, visualization analyses confirm that the CMKT method enhances the generation quality of the AVSE outputs. These findings highlight both the promise of diffusion-based methods for advancing AVSE and the value of incorporating linguistic information to further improve system performance.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant security risks, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific Jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also a range of audio editing techniques. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs, establishing the most comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark to date. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel deep learning network for Active Speech Cancellation (ASC), advancing beyond Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) methods by effectively canceling both noise and speech signals. The proposed Mamba-Masking architecture introduces a masking mechanism that directly interacts with the encoded reference signal, enabling adaptive and precisely aligned anti-signal generation-even under rapidly changing, high-frequency conditions, as commonly found in speech. Complementing this, a multi-band segmentation strategy further improves phase alignment across frequency bands. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven loss function that provides near-optimal supervisory signals for anti-signal generation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, achieving up to 7.2dB improvement in ANC scenarios and 6.2dB in ASC, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>FireRedTTS-1S: An Upgraded Streamable Foundation Text-to-Speech System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we upgrade FireRedTTS to a new version, FireRedTTS-1S, a high-quality streaming foundation text-to-speech system. FireRedTTS-1S achieves streaming speech generation via two steps: text-to-semantic decoding and semantic-to-acoustic decoding. In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware speech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be synthesized from the text via a language model in an auto-regressive manner. Meanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates generated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way. We implement two approaches to achieve this module: 1) a chunk-wise streamable flow-matching approach, and 2) a multi-stream language model-based approach. They both present high-quality and streamable speech generation but differ in real-time factor (RTF) and latency. Specifically, flow-matching decoding can generate speech by chunks, presenting a lower RTF of 0.1 but a higher latency of 300ms. Instead, the multi-stream language model generates speech by frames in an autoregressive manner, presenting a higher RTF of 0.3 but a low latency of 150ms. In experiments on zero-shot voice cloning, the objective results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality foundation model with comparable intelligibility and speaker similarity over industrial baseline systems. Furthermore, the subjective score of FireRedTTS-1S highlights its impressive synthesis performance, achieving comparable quality to the ground-truth recordings. These results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality streaming foundation TTS system.</description>

      <title>LoopGen: Training-Free Loopable Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.</description>

      <title>SepALM: Audio Language Models Are Error Correctors for Robust Speech Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While contemporary speech separation technologies adeptly process lengthy mixed audio waveforms, they are frequently challenged by the intricacies of real-world environments, including noisy and reverberant settings, which can result in artifacts or distortions in the separated speech. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SepALM, a pioneering approach that employs audio language models (ALMs) to rectify and re-synthesize speech within the text domain following preliminary separation. SepALM comprises four core components: a separator, a corrector, a synthesizer, and an aligner. By integrating an ALM-based end-to-end error correction mechanism, we mitigate the risk of error accumulation and circumvent the optimization hurdles typically encountered in conventional methods that amalgamate automatic speech recognition (ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we have developed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and knowledge distillation techniques to facilitate the reasoning and training processes of the ALM. Our experiments substantiate that SepALM not only elevates the precision of speech separation but also markedly bolsters adaptability in novel acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.</description>

Abstract: Spoken Keyword Spotting (KWS) is the task of distinguishing between the presence and absence of a keyword in audio. The accuracy of a KWS model hinges on its ability to correctly classify examples close to the keyword and non-keyword boundary. These boundary examples are often scarce in training data, limiting model performance. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically generate adversarial examples close to the decision boundary by making insertion/deletion/substitution edits on the keyword's graphemes. We evaluate this technique on held-out data for a popular keyword and show that the technique improves AUC on a dataset of synthetic hard negatives by 61% while maintaining quality on positives and ambient negative audio data.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End Training of Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian Pidgin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.11123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in spoken language applications has increased significantly in recent years. Notably, many African languages lack sufficient linguistic resources to support the robustness of these systems. This paper focuses on the development of an end-to-end speech recognition system customized for Nigerian Pidgin English. We investigated and evaluated different pretrained state-of-the-art architectures on a new dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate a notable performance of the variant Wav2Vec2 XLSR-53 on our dataset, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 29.6% on the test set, surpassing other architectures such as NEMO QUARTZNET and Wav2Vec2.0 BASE-100H in quantitative assessments. Additionally, we demonstrate that pretrained state-of-the-art architectures do not work well out-of-the-box. We performed zero-shot evaluation using XLSR-English as the baseline, chosen for its similarity to Nigerian Pidgin. This yielded a higher WER of 73.7%. By adapting this architecture to nuances represented in our dataset, we reduce error by 59.84%. Our dataset comprises 4,288 recorded utterances from 10 native speakers, partitioned into training, validation, and test sets. This study underscores the potential for improving ASR systems for under-resourced languages like Nigerian Pidgin English, contributing to greater inclusion in speech technology applications. We publicly release our unique parallel dataset (speech-to-text) on Nigerian Pidgin, as well as the model weights on Hugging Face. Our code would be made available to foster future research from the community.</description>

      <title>Personalized Voice Synthesis through Human-in-the-Loop Coordinate Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17068v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a human-in-the-loop approach to personalized voice synthesis in the absence of reference speech data from the target speaker. It is intended to help vocally disabled individuals restore their lost voices without requiring any prior recordings. The proposed approach leverages a learned speaker embedding space. Starting from an initial voice, users iteratively refine the speaker embedding parameters through a coordinate descent-like process, guided by auditory perception. By analyzing the latent space, it is noted that that the embedding parameters correspond to perceptual voice attributes, including pitch, vocal tension, brightness, and nasality, making the search process intuitive. Computer simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in approximating target voices across a diverse range of test cases.</description>

      <title>vec2wav 2.0: Advancing Voice Conversion via Discrete Token Vocoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new speech discrete token vocoder, vec2wav 2.0, which advances voice conversion (VC). We use discrete tokens from speech self-supervised models as the content features of source speech, and treat VC as a prompted vocoding task. To amend the loss of speaker timbre in the content tokens, vec2wav 2.0 utilizes the WavLM features to provide strong timbre-dependent information. A novel adaptive Snake activation function is proposed to better incorporate timbre into the waveform reconstruction process. In this way, vec2wav 2.0 learns to alter the speaker timbre appropriately given different reference prompts. Also, no supervised data is required for vec2wav 2.0 to be effectively trained. Experimental results demonstrate that vec2wav 2.0 outperforms all other baselines to a considerable margin in terms of audio quality and speaker similarity in any-to-any VC. Ablation studies verify the effects made by the proposed techniques. Moreover, vec2wav 2.0 achieves competitive cross-lingual VC even only trained on monolingual corpus. Thus, vec2wav 2.0 shows timbre can potentially be manipulated only by speech token vocoders, pushing the frontiers of VC and speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>The Faetar Benchmark: Speech Recognition in a Very Under-Resourced Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Faetar Automatic Speech Recognition Benchmark, a benchmark corpus designed to push the limits of current approaches to low-resource speech recognition. Faetar, a Franco-Proven\c{c}al variety spoken primarily in Italy, has no standard orthography, has virtually no existing textual or speech resources other than what is included in the benchmark, and is quite different from other forms of Franco-Proven\c{c}al. The corpus comes from field recordings, most of which are noisy, for which only 5 hrs have matching transcriptions, and for which forced alignment is of variable quality. The corpus contains an additional 20 hrs of unlabelled speech. We report baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual speech foundation models with a best phone error rate of 30.4%, using a pipeline that continues pre-training on the foundation model using the unlabelled set.</description>

      <title>DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</description>

      <title>TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TALKPLAY, a novel multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates recommendation as a token generation problem using large language models (LLMs). By leveraging the instruction-following and natural language generation capabilities of LLMs, our system effectively recommends music from diverse user queries while generating contextually relevant responses. While pretrained LLMs are primarily designed for text modality, TALKPLAY extends their scope through two key innovations: a multimodal music tokenizer that encodes audio features, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence signals; and a vocabulary expansion mechanism that enables unified processing and generation of both linguistic and music-relevant tokens. By integrating the recommendation system directly into the LLM architecture, TALKPLAY transforms conventional systems by: (1) unifying previous two-stage conversational recommendation systems (recommendation engines and dialogue managers) into a cohesive end-to-end system, (2) effectively utilizing long conversational context for recommendation while maintaining strong performance in extended multi-turn interactions, and (3) generating natural language responses for seamless user interaction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that TALKPLAY significantly outperforms unimodal approaches based solely on text or listening history in both recommendation performance and conversational naturalness.</description>

      <title>LipDiffuser: Lip-to-Speech Generation with Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LipDiffuser, a conditional diffusion model for lip-to-speech generation synthesizing natural and intelligible speech directly from silent video recordings. Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 and TCD-TIMIT demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment. Extensive ablation studies and cross-dataset evaluation confirm the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</description>

      <title>On the Relevance of Clinical Assessment Tasks for the Automatic Detection of Parkinson's Disease Medication State from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automatic identification of medication states of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients can assist clinicians in monitoring and scheduling personalized treatments, as well as studying the effects of medication in alleviating the motor symptoms that characterize the disease. This paper explores speech as a non-invasive and accessible biomarker for identifying PD medication states, introducing a novel approach that addresses this task from a speaker-independent perspective. While traditional machine learning models achieve competitive results, self-supervised speech representations prove essential for optimal performance, significantly surpassing knowledge-based acoustic descriptors. Experiments across diverse speech assessment tasks highlight the relevance of prosody and continuous speech in distinguishing medication states, reaching an F1-score of 88.2%. These findings may streamline clinicians' work and reduce patient effort in voice recordings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, the process of efficiently removing specific information from machine learning models, is a growing area of interest for responsible AI. However, few studies have explored the effectiveness of unlearning methods on complex tasks, particularly speech-related ones. This paper introduces UnSLU-BENCH, the first benchmark for machine unlearning in spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on four datasets spanning four languages. We address the unlearning of data from specific speakers as a way to evaluate the quality of potential "right to be forgotten" requests. We assess eight unlearning techniques and propose a novel metric to simultaneously better capture their efficacy, utility, and efficiency. UnSLU-BENCH sets a foundation for unlearning in SLU and reveals significant differences in the effectiveness and computational feasibility of various techniques.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Interpretable Multimodal Music Auto-Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music auto-tagging is essential for organizing and discovering music in extensive digital libraries. While foundation models achieve exceptional performance in this domain, their outputs often lack interpretability, limiting trust and usability for researchers and end-users alike. In this work, we present an interpretable framework for music auto-tagging that leverages groups of musically meaningful multimodal features, derived from signal processing, deep learning, ontology engineering, and natural language processing. To enhance interpretability, we cluster features semantically and employ an expectation maximization algorithm, assigning distinct weights to each group based on its contribution to the tagging process. Our method achieves competitive tagging performance while offering a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, paving the way for more transparent and user-centric music tagging systems.</description>

      <title>DualTalk: Dual-Speaker Interaction for 3D Talking Head Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters, where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker conversations. We recommend watching the supplementary video: https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/dualtalk.</description>
