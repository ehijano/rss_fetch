      <title>Species coexistence in the reinforcement learning paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal in ecology is to understand how biodiversity is maintained. Previous theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining the species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is jeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a conclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species coexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is adaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our results show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction probabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates. Mechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral tendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority (remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of the two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is a symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is responsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning species interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility exhibit a significant evolutionary advantage. Our study suggests that reinforcement learning may offer a promising new perspective for uncovering the mechanisms of biodiversity and informing conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Breaking co-existence: zealotry vs. nonlinear social impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while co-existence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry -- i.e., the presence of agents who never change state -- can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamic transformations and strange attractors in a tri-trophic predator-prey system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding predator-prey interactions is a fundamental issue in ecology, and the complex dynamics they induce are highly significant for maintaining community stability and self-organising biodiversity. Here, we investigate complex dynamical behaviors and bifurcation structures in a tri-trophic food web comprising a basal prey, an intermediate predator, and an omnivorous top predator. By combining Jacobian analysis with Hopf bifurcation theory, we derive explicit stability conditions and identify thresholds for oscillatory onset at the coexistence equilibrium. Further, we employ Shilnikov's theorem to establish criteria for the emergence of homoclinic orbit. Numerical simulations uncover a rich repertoire of dynamics, including stable limit cycles, Shilnikov homoclinic attractors, strange attractors, period-doubling cascades (with period-2 and 3 windows), chaotic bursts, and crisis-induced intermittency. These regimes are highly sensitive to the omnivore's foraging strategy: minor parameter shifts can destabilize oscillations or precipitate full system collapse. Our results highlight how omnivory and interaction structure critically modulate ecosystem complexity and resilience, offering new insights into the mechanisms that govern stability in multitrophic systems.</description>

      <title>Expand or better manage protected areas: a framework for minimising extinction risk when threats are concentrated near edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several international agreements have called for the rapid expansion of protected areas to halt biodiversity declines. However, recent research has shown that expanding protected areas may be less cost-effective than redirecting resources towards threat management in existing reserves. These findings often assume that threats are homogeneously distributed in the landscape. In some cases, threats are more concentrated near the edge of protected areas. As protected areas expand, core habitat in the centre expands more rapidly than its edge, potentially creating a refuge from threats. In this paper, we present a framework linking protected area expansion and threat management to extinction risk, via their impact on population carrying capacity and growth rate within core and edge habitats. We demonstrate the framework using a simple population model where individuals are uniformly distributed in a circular protected area threatened by poachers who penetrate the protected area to a fixed distance. We parameterise the model for Peter's Duiker (Cephalophus callipygus) harvested for food in the dense undergrowth of African forests using snares. Expanding protected areas can reduce extinction risk more effectively compared to an equivalent investment in snare removal for larger protected areas that already sustain core unhunted habitat. Our results demonstrate the importance of protected area expansion in buffering susceptible populations from fixed hunting pressure restricted to protected area edges. However, for cases where threats, wildlife, and managers respond to each other strategically in space, the relative importance of expansion versus increased management remains a significant open problem.</description>
