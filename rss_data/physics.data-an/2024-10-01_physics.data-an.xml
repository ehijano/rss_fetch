      <title>Closing the reproducibility gap: 2D materials research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D materials research has reached significant scientific milestones, accompanied by a rapidly growing industrial sector in the two decades since the field's inception. Such rapid progress requires pushing past the boundary of what is technically and scientifically feasible and carries the risk of disseminating irreproducible research results. This Expert Recommendation addresses the need for enhanced reproducibility in 2D materials science and physics. Through a comprehensive examination of the factors that affect reproducibility the authors present a set of concrete guidelines designed to improve the reliability of research results. The introduction of a Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures (STEP) offers a novel approach to documenting experimental details that are crucial for replication and troubleshooting. We emphasise the importance of involving stakeholders from research, industry, publishing, funding agencies, and policymaking to foster a culture of transparency, reliability, and trust without blind angles and critical oversights. By addressing systemic issues that hinder reproducibility and presenting actionable steps for improvement, we aim to pave the way for more robust research practices in 2D materials science, contributing to the field's scientific maturation and the subsequent development of beneficial technologies.</description>

      <title>Stable diffusion for the inverse design of microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In materials science, microstructures and their associated extrinsic properties are critical for engineering advanced structural and functional materials, yet their robust reconstruction and generation remain significant challenges. In this work, we developed a microstructure generation model based on the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, training it on a dataset of 576,000 2D synthetic microstructures containing both phase and grain orientation information. This model was applied to a range of tasks, including microstructure reconstruction, interpolation, inpainting, and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our image-based approach can analyze and generate complex microstructural features with exceptional statistical and morphological fidelity. Additionally, by integrating the ControlNet fine-tuning model, we achieved the inverse design of microstructures based on specific properties. Compared to conventional methods, our approach offers greater accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, showcasing its generative potential in exploring previously uncharted microstructures and paving the way for data-driven development of advanced materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Boosting SISSO Performance on Small Sample Datasets by Using Random Forests Prescreening for Complex Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In materials science, data-driven methods accelerate material discovery and optimization while reducing costs and improving success rates. Symbolic regression is a key to extracting material descriptors from large datasets, in particular the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) method. While SISSO needs to store the entire expression space to impose heavy memory demands, it limits the performance in complex problems. To address this issue, we propose a RF-SISSO algorithm by combining Random Forests (RF) with SISSO. In this algorithm, the Random Forest algorithm is used for prescreening, capturing non-linear relationships and improving feature selection, which may enhance the quality of the input data and boost the accuracy and efficiency on regression and classification tasks. For a testing on the SISSO's verification problem for 299 materials, RF-SISSO demonstrates its robust performance and high accuracy. RF-SISSO can maintain the testing accuracy above 0.9 across all four training sample sizes and significantly enhancing regression efficiency, especially in training subsets with smaller sample sizes. For the training subset with 45 samples, the efficiency of RF-SISSO was 265 times higher than that of original SISSO. As collecting large datasets would be both costly and time-consuming in the practical experiments, it is thus believed that RF-SISSO may benefit scientific researches by offering a high predicting accuracy with limited data efficiently.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond hardware regression trees in FPGA at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generic parallel implementation of the decision tree-based machine learning (ML) method in hardware description language (HDL) on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). A regression problem in high energy physics at the Large Hadron Collider is considered: the estimation of the magnitude of missing transverse momentum using boosted decision trees (BDT). A forest of twenty decision trees each with a maximum depth of ten using eight input variables of 16-bit precision is executed with a latency of less than 10 ns using O(0.1%) resources on Xilinx UltraScale+ VU9P -- approximately ten times faster and five times smaller compared to similar designs using high level synthesis (HLS) -- without the use of digital signal processors (DSP) while eliminating the use of block RAM (BRAM). We also demonstrate a potential application in the estimation of muon momentum for ATLAS RPC at HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Data Reduction for Low Energy Nuclear Physics Experiments Using Data Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low energy nuclear physics experiments are transitioning towards fully digital data acquisition systems. Realizing the gains in flexibility afforded by these systems relies on equally flexible data reduction techniques. In this paper, methods utilizing data frames and in-memory techniques to work with data, including data from self-triggering, digital data acquisition systems, are discussed within the context of a Python package, \texttt{sauce}. It is shown that data frame operations can encompass common analysis needs and allow interactive data analysis. Two event building techniques, dubbed referenced and referenceless event building, are shown to provide a means to transform raw list mode data into correlated multi-detector events. These techniques are demonstrated in the analysis of two example data sets.</description>

      <title>Burst-tree structure and higher-order temporal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding characteristics of temporal correlations in time series is crucial for developing accurate models in natural and social sciences. The burst-tree decomposition method was recently introduced to reveal higher-order temporal correlations in time series in a form of an event sequence, in particular, the hierarchical structure of bursty trains of events for the entire range of timescales [Jo et al., Sci.~Rep.~\textbf{10}, 12202 (2020)]. Such structure has been found to be simply characterized by the burst-merging kernel governing which bursts are merged together as the timescale for defining bursts increases. In this work, we study the effects of kernels on the higher-order temporal correlations in terms of burst size distributions, memory coefficients for bursts, and the autocorrelation function. We employ several kernels, including the constant, sum, product, and diagonal kernels as well as those inspired by empirical results. We generically find that kernels with preferential merging lead to heavy-tailed burst size distributions, while kernels with assortative merging lead to positive correlations between burst sizes. The decaying exponent of the autocorrelation function depends not only on the kernel but also on the power-law exponent of the interevent time distribution. In addition, thanks to the analogy to the coagulation process, analytical solutions of burst size distributions for some kernels could be obtained. Our findings may shed light on the role of burst-merging kernels as underlying mechanisms of higher-order temporal correlations in time series.</description>
