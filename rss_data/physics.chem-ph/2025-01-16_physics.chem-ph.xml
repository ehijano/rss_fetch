      <title>Study of Mass Transport in the Anode of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell with a New Hydrogen Flow-Rate Modulation Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen transport in the anode of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been studied with a modulation technique relating the hydrogen flow-rate $(\tilde{Q}_{H2})$ and the faradaic current $(\tilde{I})$, called $\textit{Current-modulated Hydrogen flow-rate Spectroscopy}$ (CH2S). A simple analytical expression for the transfer function, $H(j{\omega})=n \, F \, \tilde{Q}_{H2} \mathbin{/} \tilde{I}$, is provided, showing a skewed semicircle in Nyquist representation ($-H^{''}$ vs. $H^{'}$), extending from $H^{'}=0\:$ to $H^{'}=1$, and with the maximum frequency at ${\omega}_{max}=2.33\,(D_{H2}\mathbin{/}{L_{i}}^{2})$, where $D_{H2}$ is the effective hydrogen diffusivity and $L_i$ the thickness of the anode gas diffusion layer (GDL). The expression for CH2S is also calculated with an existing reversible chemical reaction in the GDL. Experimental results under different operation conditions show two transport processes limiting the anode reaction, one attributed to molecular diffusion through the partially saturated GDL, and the other to the microporous layer (MPL), or its interfaces with GDL or with the catalyst layer (CL). CH2S provides the hydrogen diffusivities $(D_{H2,i})$ associated to each process under the different conditions. Current density decreases slightly the diffusivity of the GDL, while it becomes activated in the MPL; using two GDLs in the anode improves both GDL and MPL diffusivities; humidification decreases the diffusivity in both, GDL and MPL; finally, a superhydrophobic anodic CL prepared by electrospray improves hydrogen diffusivity in GDL and MPL.</description>

      <title>Automated Quantum Chemistry Code Generation with the p$^\dagger$q Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article summarizes recent updates to the p$^\dagger$q package, which is a C++ accelerated Python library for generating equations and computer code corresponding to singly-reference many-body quantum chemistry methods such as coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC theory. Since 2021, the functionality in \pq has expanded to include boson operators, coupled fermion-boson operators, unitary cluster operators, non-particle-conserving EOM operators, spin tracing, multiple single-particle subspaces, and more. Additional developments allow for the generation of C++ and Python code that minimizes floating-point operations via contraction order optimization, sub-expression elimination, and the fusion of similar terms.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</description>

      <title>Ion correlations explain kinetic selectivity in diffusion-limited solid state synthesis reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08560v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Delayed Fluorescence in Non-Local Metasurfaces: The Role of Electronic Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter coupling has garnered significant attention for its potential to optimize optoelectronic responses. In this study, we designed open cavities featuring non-local metasurfaces composed of aluminum nanoparticle arrays. The surface lattice resonances in these metasurfaces exhibit electronic strong coupling with the boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative, known for its highly efficient thermally activated delayed f luorescence in the near-infrared. Our results show that delayed fluorescence induced by triplet-triplet annihilation can be enhanced by a factor of 2.0-2.6 in metasurfaces that are either tuned or detuned to the molecular electronic transition. We demonstrate that delayed fluorescence enhancements in these systems primarily stem from increased absorption in the organic layer caused by the nanoparticle array, while strong coupling has negligible effects on reverse intersystem crossing rates, aligning with previous studies. We support these findings with finite-difference-time-domain simulations. This study elucidates how light-matter interactions affect delayed fluorescence, highlighting the potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>An investigation of the relationship between morphology and chemistry of the D-type spherules from the recovery expedition of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide: Implications for origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic spherules have largely been classified into S-, I-, and G-types according to their compositions, and are identified to have chondritic or achondritic materials as precursors. A recent recovery expedition attempted to sample fragments of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide retrieved roughly 850 magnetic particles, some of which have unknown origins. Among those identified were a new group of highly differentiated materials consisting of close to 160 specimens categorized as "D-type" particles. We studied the D-type particles with the goal of comparing their various morphological features to their chemical compositional groupings. Four morphological classifications are considered: "scoriaceous," "stubby," "blocky," and "vesicular." The specimens from the "scoriaceous" and "stubby" groups exhibit a spinel/magnetite rim in at least one instance, characteristic of atmospheric entry, and textures indicative of quenching such as dendritic microcrystalline structures, suggesting that a subset of specimens from these groups are candidates for materials of extraterrestrial origin. The particles exhibiting "blocky" and "vesicular" textures are likely to be terrestrial in origin, with no obvious quench features or signs of ablation. The D-type particles identified and characterized in this study have a spectrum of terrestrial and probable extraterrestrial origins.</description>

      <title>Revealing Local Structures through Machine-Learning- Fused Multimodal Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic structures of materials offer valuable insights into their functionality. Determining these structures remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for systems with defects. While both experimental and computational methods exist, each has limitations in resolving nanoscale structures. Core-level spectroscopies, such as x-ray absorption (XAS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS), have been used to determine the local bonding environment and structure of materials. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding information from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data stream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition, and ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine local structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements and edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries, including those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample material system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from lithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental data. Beyond improving prediction accuracy, we find that ML model based on multimodal spectroscopic data is able to determine whether local defects such as oxygen vacancy and antisites are present, a task which is impossible for single mode spectra or other experimental techniques. Furthermore, our framework is able to provide physical interpretability, bridging spectroscopy with the local atomic and electronic structures.</description>

      <title>WeTICA: A directed search weighted ensemble based enhanced sampling method to estimate rare event kinetics in a reduced dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating rare event kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations is a non-trivial task despite the great advances in enhanced sampling methods. Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulation, a special class of enhanced sampling techniques, offers a way to directly calculate kinetic rate constants from biased trajectories without the need to modify the underlying energy landscape using bias potentials. Conventional WE algorithms use different binning schemes to partition the collective variable (CV) space separating the two metastable states of interest. In this work, we have developed a new "binless" WE simulation algorithm to bypass the hurdles of optimizing binning procedures. Our proposed protocol (WeTICA) uses a low-dimensional CV space to drive the WE simulation toward the specified target state. We have applied this new algorithm to recover the unfolding kinetics of three proteins: (A) TC5b Trp-cage mutant, (B) TC10b Trp-cage mutant, and (C) Protein G, with unfolding times spanning the range between 3 and 40 {\mu}s using projections along predefined fixed Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) eigenvectors as CVs. Calculated unfolding times converge to the reported values with good accuracy with more than one order of magnitude less cumulative WE simulation time than the unfolding time scales with or without a priori knowledge of the CVs that can capture unfolding. Our algorithm can be used with other linear CVs, not limited to TICA. Moreover, the new walker selection criteria for resampling employed in this algorithm can be used on more sophisticated nonlinear CV space for further improvements of binless WE methods.</description>

      <title>All-Electron Molecular Tunnel Ionization Based on the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory in the Integral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multielectron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, this in turn facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character.</description>

      <title>Multiconfigurational short-range on-top pair-density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the theory and implementation of a fully variational wave function -- density functional theory (DFT) hybrid model, which is applicable to many cases of strong correlation. We denote this model the multiconfigurational self-consistent on-top pair-density functional theory model (MC-srPDFT). We have previously shown how the multi-configurational short-range DFT hybrid model (MC-srDFT) can describe many multiconfigurational cases of any spin symmetry, and also state-specific calculations on excited states (Hedeg{\aa}rd et al. J. Chem. Phys. 148, 2018, 214103). However, the srDFT part of the MC-srDFT has some deficiencies that it shares with Kohn-Sham DFT; in particular (1) self-interaction errors (albeit reduced because of the range separation), (2) that different M$_S$ states incorrectly become non-degenerate, and (3) that singlet and non-singlet states dissociating to the same open-shell fragments incorrectly lead to different electronic energies at dissociation. The model we present in this paper corrects these deficiencies by introducing the on-top pair density as an auxiliary variable replacing the spin density. Unlike other models in the literature, our model is fully variational and employs a long-range version of the on-top pair density. The implementation is a second-order optimization algorithm ensuring robust convergence to both ground- and excited states. We show how MC-srPDFT solves the mentioned challenges by sample calculations on the ground state singlet curve of H$_2$, N$_2$, and Cr$_2$ and the lowest triplet curves for N$_2$ and Cr$_2$. Furthermore, the rotational barrier for ethene is investigated for the S$_0$ and T$_1$ states. The calculations show correct degeneracy between the singlet and triplet curves at dissociation and the results are invariant to the choice of M$_S$ value for the triplet curves.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical ODE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling atmospheric chemistry is complex and computationally intense. Given the recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we propose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We consider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential Equation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future time evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator (NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To efficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time embedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we use the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient computation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the training optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical dataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Toward Automated Simulation Research Workflow through LLM Prompt Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities for the automation of scientific research spanning both experimental processes and computational simulations. This study explores the feasibility of constructing an autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLMs through prompt engineering and automated program design to automate the entire simulation research process according to a human-provided research plan. This process includes experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, and report compilation. Using a well-studied simulation problem of polymer chain conformations as a test case, we assessed the long-task completion and reliability of ASAs powered by different LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, etc. Our findings revealed that ASA-GPT-4o achieved near-flawless execution on designated research missions, underscoring the potential of methods like ASA to achieve automation in simulation research processes to enhance research efficiency. The outlined automation can be iteratively performed for up to 20 cycles without human intervention, illustrating the potential of ASA for long-task workflow automation. Additionally, we discussed the intrinsic traits of ASA in managing extensive tasks, focusing on self-validation mechanisms, and the balance between local attention and global oversight.</description>
