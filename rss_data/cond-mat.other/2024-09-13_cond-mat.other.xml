      <title>Corotation of two quantized vortices coupled with collective modes in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically examine the corotation of two parallel quantized vortices in a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) employing the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations. The long-range gravitationally attractive interaction allows the BEC to self-confine without the need for external potentials, while the density-dependence of the gravitational potential induces intriguing behaviors in the quantized vortices. The aim of this study is to provide a clue for understanding the corotation of two quantized vortices under the influence of gravitational interactions. The corotation of two quantized vortices is coupled with collective modes of the BEC, which markedly differs from the behavior observed in typical BECs confined by an external potential. The rotational period increases linearly with the initial position from the center of the BEC. This deviation from the quadratic increase observed in a uniform BEC suggests that the gravitational interaction exerts a drag effect on the rotating quantized vortices. The two closely positioned quantized vortices rotate along elliptical orbits with radial fluctuations. However, when the quantized vortices are initially positioned beyond a critical radius comparable to their core sizes, their trajectory transitions into an outward spiral, implying the onset of effective dissipation. Our findings demonstrate that the radial fluctuations of the quantized vortex resonate with the quadrupole mode of the BEC, giving rise to a dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <title>CAVERNAUTE: a design and manufacturing pipeline of a rigid but foldable indoor airship aerial system for cave exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airships, best recognized for their unique quality of payload/energy ratio, present a fascinating challenge for the field of engineering. Their construction and operation require a delicate balance of materials and rules, making them a compelling object of study. They embody a distinct intersection of physics, design, and innovation, offering a wide array of possibilities for future transportation and exploration. Thanks to their long-flight endurance, they are suited for long-term missions. To operate in complex environments such as indoor cluttered spaces, their membrane and mechatronics need to be protected from impacts. This paper presents a new indoor airship design inspired by origami and the Kresling pattern. The airship structure combines a carbon fiber exoskeleton and UV resin micro-lattices for shock absorption. Our design strengthens the robot while granting the ability to access narrow spaces by folding the structure - up to a volume expansion ratio of 19.8. To optimize the numerous parameters of the airship, we present a pipeline for design, manufacture, and assembly. It takes into account manufacturing constraints, dimensions of the target deployment area, and aerostatics, allowing for easy and quick testing of new configurations. We also present unique features made possible by combining origami with airship design, which reduces the chances of mission-compromising failures. We demonstrate the potential of the design with a complete simulation including an effective control strategy leveraging lightweight mechatronics to optimize flight autonomy in exploration missions of unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Tuned ionic mobility by Ultrafast-laser pulses in Black Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly non-equilibrium conditions in femtosecond-laser excited solids cause a variety of ultrafast phenomena that are not accessible by thermal conditions, like sub-picosecond solid-to-liquid or solid-to-solid phase transitions. In recent years the microscopic pathways of various laser-induced crystal rearrangements could be identified and led to novel applications and/or improvements in optoelectronics, photonics, and nanotechnology. However, it remains unclear what effect a femtosecond-laser excitation has on ionic impurities within an altered crystal environment, in particular on the atomic mobility. Here, we performed ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations on laser-excited black silicon, a promising material for high-efficient solar cells, using the Code for Highly excIted Valence Electron Systems (CHIVES). By computing time-dependent Bragg peak intensities for doping densities of 0.16% and 2.31% we could identify the overall weakening of the crystal environment with increasing impurity density. The analysis of Si-S bond angles and lengths after different excitation densities, as well as computing interatomic forces allowed to identify a change in ion mobility with increasing impurity density and excitation strength. Our results indicate the importance of impurity concentrations for ionic mobility in laser-excited black silicon and could give significant insight for semiconductor device optimization and materials science advancement.</description>

      <title>Simulating anharmonic vibrational polaritons beyond the long wavelength approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate anharmonic vibrational polaritons formed due to strong light-matter interactions in an optical cavity between radiation modes and anharmonic vibrations beyond the long-wavelength limit. We introduce a conceptually simple description of light-matter interactions, where spatially localized cavity radiation modes couple to localized vibrations. Within this theoretical framework, we employ self-consistent phonon theory and vibrational dynamical mean-field theory to efficiently simulate momentum-resolved vibrational-polariton spectra, including effects of anharmonicity. Numerical simulations in model systems demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Unexpected changes in the band structure within AFM1 state of CeBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the evolution of the electronic structure of CeBi upon a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions. We find evidence for a new AFM transition in addition to two previously known from transport studies. We demonstrate the development of an additional Dirac state in the (+-+-) ordered phase and a transformation of unconventional surface-state pairs in the (++--) ordered phase. This revises the phase diagram of this intriguing material, where there are now three distinct AFM states below TN in zero magnetic field instead of two as it was previously thought.</description>
