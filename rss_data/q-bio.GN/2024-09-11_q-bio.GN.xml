      <title>Hierarchical novel class discovery for single-cell transcriptomic profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major challenges arising from single-cell transcriptomics experiments is the question of how to annotate the associated single-cell transcriptomic profiles. Because of the large size and the high dimensionality of the data, automated methods for annotation are needed. We focus here on datasets obtained in the context of developmental biology, where the differentiation process leads to a hierarchical structure. We consider a frequent setting where both labeled and unlabeled data are available at training time, but the sets of the labels of labeled data on one side and of the unlabeled data on the other side, are disjoint. It is an instance of the Novel Class Discovery problem. The goal is to achieve two objectives, clustering the data and mapping the clusters with labels. We propose extensions of k-Means and GMM clustering methods for solving the problem and report comparative results on artificial and experimental transcriptomic datasets. Our approaches take advantage of the hierarchical nature of the data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sample Size for Supervised Machine Learning with Bulk Transcriptomic Sequencing: A Learning Curve Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate sample classification using transcriptomics data is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Achieving this goal necessitates determining a suitable sample size that ensures adequate statistical power without undue resource allocation. Current sample size calculation methods rely on assumptions and algorithms that may not align with supervised machine learning techniques for sample classification. Addressing this critical methodological gap, we present a novel computational approach that establishes the power-versus-sample-size relationship by employing a data augmentation strategy followed by fitting a learning curve. We comprehensively evaluated its performance for microRNA and RNA sequencing data, considering diverse data characteristics and algorithm configurations, based on a spectrum of evaluation metrics. To foster accessibility and reproducibility, the Python and R code for implementing our approach is available on GitHub. Its deployment will significantly facilitate the adoption of machine learning in transcriptomics studies and accelerate their translation into clinically useful classifiers for personalized treatment.</description>

      <title>Advances in colored k-mer sets: essentials for the curious</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in k-mer-based data structures representing collections of several samples (sometimes called colored de Bruijn graphs) and their applications in large-scale sequence indexing and pangenomics. The review explores the evolution of k-mer set representations, highlighting the trade-offs between exact and inexact methods, as well as the integration of compression strategies and modular implementations. I discuss the impact of these structures on practical applications and describe recent utilization of these methods for analysis. By surveying the state-of-the-art techniques and identifying emerging trends, this work aims to guide researchers in selecting and developing methods for large scale and reference-free genomic data. For a broader overview of k-mer set representations and foundational data structures, see the accompanying article on practical k-mer sets.</description>

      <title>CRADLE-VAE: Enhancing Single-Cell Gene Perturbation Modeling with Counterfactual Reasoning-based Artifact Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to various perturbations is a critical focus in drug discovery and personalized therapeutics, with deep learning models playing a significant role in this endeavor. Single-cell datasets contain technical artifacts that may hinder the predictability of such models, which poses quality control issues highly regarded in this area. To address this, we propose CRADLE-VAE, a causal generative framework tailored for single-cell gene perturbation modeling, enhanced with counterfactual reasoning-based artifact disentanglement. Throughout training, CRADLE-VAE models the underlying latent distribution of technical artifacts and perturbation effects present in single-cell datasets. It employs counterfactual reasoning to effectively disentangle such artifacts by modulating the latent basal spaces and learns robust features for generating cellular response data with improved quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves not only treatment effect estimation performance but also generative quality as well. The CRADLE-VAE codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/CRADLE-VAE.</description>
