      <title>Variable Rate Neural Compression for Sparse Detector Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy large-scale particle colliders generate data at extraordinary rates. Developing real-time high-throughput data compression algorithms to reduce data volume and meet the bandwidth requirement for storage has become increasingly critical. Deep learning is a promising technology that can address this challenging topic. At the newly constructed sPHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) serves as the main tracking detector, which records three-dimensional particle trajectories in a volume of a gas-filled cylinder. In terms of occupancy, the resulting data flow can be very sparse reaching $10^{-3}$ for proton-proton collisions. Such sparsity presents a challenge to conventional learning-free lossy compression algorithms, such as SZ, ZFP, and MGARD. In contrast, emerging deep learning-based models, particularly those utilizing convolutional neural networks for compression, have outperformed these conventional methods in terms of compression ratios and reconstruction accuracy. However, research on the efficacy of these deep learning models in handling sparse datasets, like those produced in particle colliders, remains limited. Furthermore, most deep learning models do not adapt their processing speeds to data sparsity, which affects efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for TPC data compression via key-point identification facilitated by sparse convolution. Our proposed algorithm, BCAE-VS, achieves a $75\%$ improvement in reconstruction accuracy with a $10\%$ increase in compression ratio over the previous state-of-the-art model. Additionally, BCAE-VS manages to achieve these results with a model size over two orders of magnitude smaller. Lastly, we have experimentally verified that as sparsity increases, so does the model's throughput.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of a novel thermal neutron detection system using event mode camera and LYSO scintillation crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feasibility study of a new technique for thermal neutron detection using a Timepix3 camera (TPX3Cam) with custom-made optical add-ons operated in event-mode data acquisition is presented. The camera has a spatial resolution of ~ 16 um and a temporal resolution of 1.56 ns. Thermal neutrons react with 6 Lithium to produce a pair of 2.73 MeV tritium and 2.05 MeV alpha particles, which in turn interact with a thin layer of LYSO crystal to produce localized scintillation photons. These photons are directed by a pair of lenses to an image intensifier, before being recorded by the TPX3Cam. The results were reconstructed through a custom clustering algorithm utilizing the Time-of-Arrival (ToA) and geometric centre of gravity of the hits. Filtering parameters were found through data analysis to reduce the background of gamma and other charged particles. The efficiency of the converter is 4%, and the overall detection efficiency of the system including the lead shielding and polythene moderator is ~ 0.34%, all converted thermal neutrons can be seen by the TPX3Cam. The experiment used a weak thermal neutron source against a large background, the measured signal-to-noise ratio is 1/67.5. Under such high noise, thermal neutrons were successfully detected and predicted the reduced neutron rate, and matched the simulated rate of the thermal neutrons converted from the source. This result demonstrated the excellent sensitivity of the system.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of SiC radiation detector technologies with synchrotron X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To cope with environments with high levels of radiation, non-silicon semiconductors such as silicon carbide detectors are being proposed for instrumentation.
  4H-SiC diodes for radiation detection have been fabricated in the IMB-CNM Clean Room, for which different strategies to define the electrical contact of the implants had been implemented, in an attempt to optimise the technology for, e.g., medical applications or low energy radiation detection, as the material choice can affect the sensitivity of the device. Among these technologies, it is included an epitaxially-grown graphene layer as part of the electrical contact.
  In this paper, a selection of four configurations of the IMB-CNM SiC diodes are characterised in terms of radiation detector response. Photodiode performance under 20 keV X-rays irradiation in the XALOC beam line at ALBA Synchrotron is presented. Over-responses in the range of 12-19% linked to the interaction of the radiation with the metallic layers are observed. A good uniformity response as well as a good linearity at 0~V bias is reported, even in the under-depleted devices. This work exemplifies the good performance of SiC detectors fabricated at IMB-CNM specifically for low-energy X ray characterization at high X-ray intensities.</description>

      <title>Reward based optimization of resonance-enhanced piezoresponse spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic spectroscopies in Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) are critical for probing material properties, such as force interactions, mechanical properties, polarization switching, and electrochemical reactions and ionic dynamics. However, the practical implementation of these measurements is constrained by the need to balance imaging time and data quality. Signal to noise requirements favor long acquisition times and high frequencies to improve signal fidelity. However, these are limited on the low end by contact resonant frequency and photodiode sensitivity, and on the high end by the time needed to acquire high-resolution spectra, or the propensity for samples degradation under high field excitation over long times. The interdependence of key parameters such as instrument settings, acquisition times, and sampling rates makes manual tuning labor-intensive and highly dependent on user expertise, often yielding operator-dependent results. These limitations are prominent in techniques like Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) that utilize multiple concurrent feedback loops for topography and resonance frequency tracking. Here, a reward-driven workflow is proposed that automates the tuning process, adapting experimental conditions in real time to optimize data quality. This approach significantly reduces the complexity and time required for manual adjustments and can be extended to other SPM spectroscopic methods, enhancing overall efficiency and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Rapid Differentiation between Microplastic Particles Using Integrated Microwave Cytometry with 3D Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid identification of microparticles in liquid is an important problem in environmental and biomedical applications such as for microplastic detection in water sources and physiological fluids. Existing spectro-scopic techniques are usually slow and not compatible with flow-through systems. Here we analyze single microparticles in the 14 - 20 micrometer range using a combination of two electronic sensors in the same microfluidic system: a microwave capacitive sensor and a resistive pulse sensor. Together, this integrated sen-sor system yields the effective electrical permittivity of the analyte particles. To simplify data analysis, 3D electrode arrangements were used instead of planar electrodes, so that the generated signal is unaffected by the height of the particle in the microfluidic channel. With this platform, we were able to distinguish between polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) microparticles. We showcase the sensitivity and speed of this tech-nique and discuss the implications for the future application of microwave cytometry technology in the en-vironmental and biomedical fields.</description>

      <title>Implementation and performance of a fiber-coupled CMOS camera in an ultrafast reflective high-energy electron diffraction experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implementation of a monolithic fiber-optically coupled CMOS-based TemCam-XF416 camera into our ultra-high vacuum (UHV) ultrafast reflection high-energy electron diffraction setup is reported. A combination of a pumpable gate valve and a self-built cooling collar allows UHV conditions to be reached without the need to remove the heat-sensitive device. The water-cooled collar is mounted to the camera housing and prevents heating of the detector upon bake-out of the UHV chamber. The TemCam provides an one order of magnitude higher spatial resolution than the previously used microchannel plate (MCP) based detector (Burle Chevron 3040FM) which enables a 30% higher resolution in reciprocal space. The low background intensity and the 4$\times$ lager dynamic range enables analysis of the diffuse intensity of the diffraction pattern like Kikuchi lines and bands. A key advantage over the previous MCP detector is the complete absence of the blooming effect, which enables the quantitative spot profile analysis of the diffraction spots. The inherent light sensitivity in an optical pump experiment can be overcome by using photons with h{\nu} &lt; 1.12 eV, i.e., the indirect band gap of silicon, or by shielding any stray light.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <title>TCAD Simulation of Stitching for Passive CMOS Strip Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the tracking detectors for high energy particle experiments are filled with silicon detectors since they are radiation hard, they can give very small spatial resolution and they can take advantage of the silicon electronics foundries developments and production lines.
  Strip detectors are very useful to cover large areas for tracking purposes, while consuming less power per area compared to pixel sensors. The majority of particle physics experiments use conventional silicon strip detectors fabricated in foundries that do not use stitching, relying on a very small number of foundries worldwide that can provide large amounts of strip detectors. Fabricating strip detectors in a CMOS foundry opens the possibility to use more foundries and to include active elements in the strips for future productions. For the passive CMOS strip detectors project we fabricated strip detectors in a CMOS foundry using two 1 cm2 reticles that are stitched together along the wafer. The fabricated strips stitched the reticles three and five times, and it was shown that the performance of those strips is not affected by the stitching.
  This paper shows 3D TCAD simulations of the stitching area to investigate the possible effects stitching can have on the performance of the strip detectors, considering different stitching mismatches. We will show that the mismatch of stitched structures up to 1 um does not impact the performance with TCAD simulations which agrees with the results obtained from the measurements.</description>

      <title>New methods of neutrino and anti-neutrino detection from 0.115 to 105 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a neutrino detector with threshold energies from ~0.115 to 105 MeV in a clean detection mode almost completely void of accidental backgrounds. It was initially developed for the NASA $\nu$SOL project to put a solar neutrino detector very close to the Sun with 1,000 to 10,000 times higher solar neutrino flux than on Earth. Similar interactions have been found for anti-neutrinos, which were initially intended for Beta decay neutrinos from reactors, geological sources, or for nuclear security applications. These techniques work at the 1 to 100 MeV region for neutrinos from the ORNL Spallation Neutron Source or low energy accelerator neutrino and anti-neutrino production targets less than $\sim$100 MeV. The identification process is clean, with a double pulse detection signature within a time window between the first interaction producing the conversion electron or positron and the secondary gamma emission 100 ns to ~1 $\mu$s, which removes most accidental backgrounds. These new modes for neutrino and anti-neutrino detection of low energy neutrinos and anti-neutrinos could allow improvements to neutrino interaction measurements from an accelerator beam on a target.</description>

      <title>Comparison of time-of-flight with MIEZE spectroscopy of H$_2$O: Necessity to go beyond the spin-echo approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we discuss the comparability of data acquisitioned with the Modulation of IntEnsity with Zero Effort data, a neutron spin-echo (NSE) technique to neutron Time-of-Flight (ToF) spectroscopy data. As a NSE technique MIEZE records the intermediate scattering function $\mathcal{I}(Q, \tau)$ making it necessary to perform a Fourier transform to directly compare it to $S(Q, E)$, measured by ToF spectroscopy. Transforming either data set into the complementary parameter space requires detailed knowledge of detector efficiency, instrumental resolution, and background. We discuss these aspects by comparing measurements on pure water performed on the spectrometers RESEDA and TOFTOF under the same experimental conditions. Additionally, we discuss the data evaluation of spin-echo data beyond the SE approximation, which limits these techniques to small energy transfers. Furthermore, computational methods like molecular dynamics simulations are essential for understanding these processes and will become increasingly important as we study more complex systems.</description>
