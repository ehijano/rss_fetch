      <title>Problem Framing in the AI era: a new model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective problem-solving in physics extends beyond the mere application of mathematical formulas; it necessitates an understanding of how mathematical concepts connect to and reflect the physical world. A strong epistemological framework based on problem framing (PF) is essential for students, as it enables them to justify their mathematical decisions and recognize the relationship between abstract mathematics and real-world physical phenomena. This becomes increasingly important in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), where the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is growing rapidly. This paper explores the impact of AI, specifically LLMs like ChatGPT, on upper-level students' PF in physics education. Building on existing models, in this exploratory theoretical paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional framework grounded in Situated Cognition Theory and Greeno's extended semantic model, aiming to elucidate how AI could influence students' epistemological framing during Cooperative Problem Solving activities (CPS). We advocate for instructors to encourage AI-assisted CPS to foster critical thinking and enhance student engagement with real-world scenarios. Preliminary results suggest that ChatGPT can aid in developing symbolic and visual languages within problem framing, though further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the potential of AI-driven intelligent tutoring systems for personalized learning.</description>

      <title>The physics of diamagnetic levitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.02160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a problem on diamagnetic levitation, which may be suitable for specialized high-school or first-year students in physical sciences. We guide the students, step-by-step, through the physics of diamagnetic levitation. The calculations are simplified by assuming a ring-shaped geometry of the diamagnetic object residing above a magnetic dipole. This problem was originally intended for the International Physics Olympiad 2016 (IPHO 2016), but was finally deemed surplus and therefore not set.</description>

      <title>Addressing misconceptions in university physics: A review and experiences from quantum physics educators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Students often begin physics courses with misconceptions rooted in everyday experience and intuition, which can be resistant to change. While research has identified strategies for addressing misconceptions across physics, it remains unclear whether different domains, like classical and quantum physics, require different approaches. On one hand, quantum concepts are further removed from daily experience, possibly requiring specialized strategies. On the other, all physics must be learned rather than innately understood, and classical physics already contains many counterintuitive ideas, suggesting the same strategies may be equally valid. To explore this question, we first develop a structure to organize the existing literature on addressing misconceptions in physics education. We identify 126 studies, which we group into six categories, three of which include further subcategories. Rather than offering a comprehensive literature review, this scheme provides a structural lens through which to compare how various strategies align. We then take an instructor-centered approach, using our framework to guide interviews with quantum physics instructors. We interview 12 instructors from the University of Waterloo's Institute for Quantum Computing and the Perimeter Institute who have collectively taught over 100 quantum courses. Our findings suggest that quantum physics instructors find strategies similar to those used in classical physics effective for identifying and addressing misconceptions. This highlights the potential to adapt, rather than replace, existing instructional tools to better meet the conceptual challenges of quantum physics. Our work provides practical insights for educators and curriculum designers aiming to support deeper understanding in quantum mechanics.</description>
