      <title>Threshold for loss of Landau damping in double-harmonic rf systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau damping is a natural stabilization mechanism that mitigates coherent beam instabilities. In the longitudinal plane, loss of Landau damping~(LLD) occurs when a coherent mode of oscillation emerges from the incoherent band of the bunch synchrotron frequencies. This work extends the recent LLD studies to the relevant case of double-harmonic rf systems. Specifically, it is shown that in the bunch shortening mode (both rf systems in phase at the bunch position for a non-accelerating bucket), inductive impedance above transition energy results in a vanishing LLD threshold for a binominal particle distribution, similar to the single-harmonic rf case. In this configuration, refined analytical estimates of the synchrotron frequency distribution enabled the derivation of an analytical equation for the LLD threshold by introducing an upper cutoff frequency to the impedance. The LLD threshold is studied through the concept of van Kampen modes and takes into account the effect of the voltage ratio, as well as the relative phase between the two rf systems for an inductive impedance above transition energy (or capacitive below). The validity of the theoretical studies is supported by extensive beam measurements conducted under different bucket-filling conditions in two synchrotrons, the PS and the SPS at CERN. Beyond the analytical estimates, the observations are moreover compared with the semi-analytical code MELODY and macroparticle tracking simulations in BLonD.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Beam on Plasma Stopping Power in the Resonance Regions of Fusion Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent proposal of accelerator based fusion reactor considers a scheme where an ion beam from the accelerator hits the target plasma on the resonance of the fusion reaction so that the reactivity ($\sigma v$) can be an order of magnitude larger than that of a thermonuclear reactor. One of the important inputs is the stopping power which is needed to assess the energy loss of the beam in the plasma. In this work, we shall use the analytic formulation of Brown, Preston and Singleton~\cite{Brown:2005ji} to calculate the temperature dependence of the stopping power due to the target $t, {}^3H_e$, and ${}^{11}B$ plasmas in the resonance regions of their respective fusion reactions, i.e., $ d + t \rightarrow n + \alpha, d + {}^3H_e \rightarrow p + \alpha$, and $p + {}^{11}B \rightarrow 3 \alpha$. It is found that the calculated stopping power, especially when the quantum corrections are included, does not go down with temperature as fast at $T^{-3/2}$. Instead it decreases slower, more like $T^{-x}$ with $x \le 1$ in the range of T from $\sim$ 5 to 50 keV for $d$ on $t$ and ${}^3H_e$ plasmas around their resonance energies.</description>

      <title>Injection Optimization at Particle Accelerators via Reinforcement Learning: From Simulation to Real-World Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the injection process in particle accelerators is crucial for enhancing beam quality and operational efficiency. This paper presents a framework for utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the injection process at accelerator facilities. By framing the optimization challenge as an RL problem, we developed an agent capable of dynamically aligning the beam's transverse space with desired targets. Our methodology leverages the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, enhanced with domain randomization and dense neural networks, to train the agent in simulated environments with varying dynamics promoting it to learn a generalized robust policy. The agent was evaluated in live runs at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY and it has successfully optimized the beam cross-section reaching human operator level but in notably less time. An empirical study further validated the importance of each architecture component in achieving a robust and generalized optimization strategy. The results demonstrate the potential of RL in automating and improving optimization tasks at particle acceleration facilities.</description>
