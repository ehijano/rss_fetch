      <title>Utilizing Weak-to-Strong Consistency for Semi-Supervised Glomeruli Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of glomerulus instances attains high clinical significance in the automated analysis of renal biopsies to aid in diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. Analyzing real-world histopathology images often encompasses inter-observer variability and requires a labor-intensive process of data annotation. Therefore, conventional supervised learning approaches generally achieve sub-optimal performance when applied to external datasets. Considering these challenges, we present a semi-supervised learning approach for glomeruli segmentation based on the weak-to-strong consistency framework validated on multiple real-world datasets. Our experimental results on 3 independent datasets indicate superior performance of our approach as compared with existing supervised baseline models such as U-Net and SegFormer.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diagnostic Reliability of Foundation Model with Uncertainty Estimation in OCT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inability to express the confidence level and detect unseen classes has limited the clinical implementation of artificial intelligence in the real-world. We developed a foundation model with uncertainty estimation (FMUE) to detect 11 retinal conditions on optical coherence tomography (OCT). In the internal test set, FMUE achieved a higher F1 score of 96.76% than two state-of-the-art algorithms, RETFound and UIOS, and got further improvement with thresholding strategy to 98.44%. In the external test sets obtained from other OCT devices, FMUE achieved an accuracy of 88.75% and 92.73% before and after thresholding. Our model is superior to two ophthalmologists with a higher F1 score (95.17% vs. 61.93% &amp;71.72%). Besides, our model correctly predicts high uncertainty scores for samples with ambiguous features, of non-target-category diseases, or with low-quality to prompt manual checks and prevent misdiagnosis. FMUE provides a trustworthy method for automatic retinal anomalies detection in the real-world clinical open set environment.</description>

      <title>Research on Feature Extraction Data Processing System For MRI of Brain Diseases Based on Computer Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the existing wavelet image processing techniques are carried out in the form of single-scale reconstruction and multiple iterations. However, processing high-quality fMRI data presents problems such as mixed noise and excessive computation time. This project proposes the use of matrix operations by combining mixed noise elimination methods with wavelet analysis to replace traditional iterative algorithms. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the auditory cortex of a single subject is analyzed and compared to the wavelet domain signal processing technology based on repeated times and the world's most influential SPM8. Experiments show that this algorithm is the fastest in computing time, and its detection effect is comparable to the traditional iterative algorithm. However, this has a higher practical value for the processing of FMRI data. In addition, the wavelet analysis method proposed signal processing to speed up the calculation rate.</description>

      <title>On Instabilities of Unsupervised Denoising Diffusion Models in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models offer a promising approach to accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and producing diagnostic-level images in an unsupervised manner. However, our study demonstrates that even tiny worst-case potential perturbations transferred from a surrogate model can cause these models to generate fake tissue structures that may mislead clinicians. The transferability of such worst-case perturbations indicates that the robustness of image reconstruction may be compromised due to MR system imperfections or other sources of noise. Moreover, at larger perturbation strengths, diffusion models exhibit Gaussian noise-like artifacts that are distinct from those observed in supervised models and are more challenging to detect. Our results highlight the vulnerability of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based reconstruction models to possible worst-case perturbations and underscore the need for further research to improve their robustness and reliability in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Are Vision xLSTM Embedded UNet More Reliable in Medical 3D Image Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of developing efficient medical image segmentation has evolved from initial dependence on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the present investigation of hybrid models that combine CNNs with Vision Transformers. Furthermore, there is an increasing focus on creating architectures that are both high-performing in medical image segmentation tasks and computationally efficient to be deployed on systems with limited resources. Although transformers have several advantages like capturing global dependencies in the input data, they face challenges such as high computational and memory complexity. This paper investigates the integration of CNNs and Vision Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Vision-xLSTM) models by introducing a novel approach called UVixLSTM. The Vision-xLSTM blocks captures temporal and global relationships within the patches extracted from the CNN feature maps. The convolutional feature reconstruction path upsamples the output volume from the Vision-xLSTM blocks to produce the segmentation output. Our primary objective is to propose that Vision-xLSTM forms a reliable backbone for medical image segmentation tasks, offering excellent segmentation performance and reduced computational complexity. UVixLSTM exhibits superior performance compared to state-of-the-art networks on the publicly-available Synapse dataset.

      <title>Leveraging Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Skin Cancer Classification: Balancing Accuracy and Computational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin cancer is a major concern to public health, accounting for one-third of the reported cancers. If not detected early, the cancer has the potential for severe consequences. Recognizing the critical need for effective skin cancer classification, we address the limitations of existing models, which are often too large to deploy in areas with limited computational resources. In response, we present a knowledge distillation based approach for creating a lightweight yet high-performing classifier. The proposed solution involves fusing three models, namely ResNet152V2, ConvNeXtBase, and ViT Base, to create an effective teacher model. The teacher model is then employed to guide a lightweight student model of size 2.03 MB. This student model is further compressed to 469.77 KB using 16-bit quantization, enabling smooth incorporation into edge devices. With six-stage image preprocessing, data augmentation, and a rigorous ablation study, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.75% on the HAM10000 dataset and 98.94% on the Kaggle dataset in classifying benign and malignant skin cancers. With its high accuracy and compact size, our model appears to be a potential choice for accurate skin cancer classification, particularly in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Aperture Fusion of Transformer-Convolutional Network (MFTC-Net) for 3D Medical Image Segmentation and Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers have shown superior performance to the traditional convolutional-based frameworks in many vision applications, including but not limited to the segmentation of 3D medical images. To further advance this area, this study introduces the Multi-Aperture Fusion of Transformer-Convolutional Network (MFTC-Net), which integrates the output of Swin Transformers and their corresponding convolutional blocks using 3D fusion blocks. The Multi-Aperture incorporates each image patch at its original resolutions with its pyramid representation to better preserve minute details. The proposed architecture has demonstrated a score of 89.73 and 7.31 for Dice and HD95, respectively, on the Synapse multi-organs dataset an improvement over the published results. The improved performance also comes with the added benefits of the reduced complexity of approximately 40 million parameters.

      <title>Diff3Dformer: Leveraging Slice Sequence Diffusion for Enhanced 3D CT Classification with Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manifestation of symptoms associated with lung diseases can vary in different depths for individual patients, highlighting the significance of 3D information in CT scans for medical image classification. While Vision Transformer has shown superior performance over convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks, their effectiveness is often demonstrated on sufficiently large 2D datasets and they easily encounter overfitting issues on small medical image datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a Diffusion-based 3D Vision Transformer (Diff3Dformer), which utilizes the latent space of the Diffusion model to form the slice sequence for 3D analysis and incorporates clustering attention into ViT to aggregate repetitive information within 3D CT scans, thereby harnessing the power of the advanced transformer in 3D classification tasks on small datasets. Our method exhibits improved performance on two different scales of small datasets of 3D lung CT scans, surpassing the state of the art 3D methods and other transformer-based approaches that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its robust and superior performance across different scales of data. Experimental results underscore the superiority of our proposed method, indicating its potential for enhancing medical image classification tasks in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Cross-Task Interaction for Survival Analysis in Whole Slide Pathological Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival prediction, utilizing pathological images and genomic profiles, is increasingly important in cancer analysis and prognosis. Despite significant progress, precise survival analysis still faces two main challenges: (1) The massive pixels contained in whole slide images (WSIs) complicate the process of pathological images, making it difficult to generate an effective representation of the tumor microenvironment (TME). (2) Existing multimodal methods often rely on alignment strategies to integrate complementary information, which may lead to information loss due to the inherent heterogeneity between pathology and genes. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Cross-Task Interaction (MCTI) framework to explore the intrinsic correlations between subtype classification and survival analysis tasks. Specifically, to capture TME-related features in WSIs, we leverage the subtype classification task to mine tumor regions. Simultaneously, multi-head attention mechanisms are applied in genomic feature extraction, adaptively performing genes grouping to obtain task-related genomic embedding. With the joint representation of pathological images and genomic data, we further introduce a Transport-Guided Attention (TGA) module that uses optimal transport theory to model the correlation between subtype classification and survival analysis tasks, effectively transferring potential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approaches, with MCTI outperforming state-of-the-art frameworks on three public benchmarks. \href{https://github.com/jsh0792/MCTI}{https://github.com/jsh0792/MCTI}.</description>

      <title>A benchmark for 2D foetal brain ultrasound analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain development involves a sequence of structural changes from early stages of the embryo until several months after birth. Currently, ultrasound is the established technique for screening due to its ability to acquire dynamic images in real-time without radiation and to its cost-efficiency. However, identifying abnormalities remains challenging due to the difficulty in interpreting foetal brain images. In this work we present a set of 104 2D foetal brain ultrasound images acquired during the 20th week of gestation that have been co-registered to a common space from a rough skull segmentation. The images are provided both on the original space and template space centred on the ellipses of all the subjects. Furthermore, the images have been annotated to highlight landmark points from structures of interest to analyse brain development. Both the final atlas template with probabilistic maps and the original images can be used to develop new segmentation techniques, test registration approaches for foetal brain ultrasound, extend our work to longitudinal datasets and to detect anomalies in new images.</description>

      <title>Robustly Optimized Deep Feature Decoupling Network for Fatty Liver Diseases Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current medical image classification efforts mainly aim for higher average performance, often neglecting the balance between different classes. This can lead to significant differences in recognition accuracy between classes and obvious recognition weaknesses. Without the support of massive data, deep learning faces challenges in fine-grained classification of fatty liver. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning framework that combines feature decoupling and adaptive adversarial training. Firstly, we employ two iteratively compressed decouplers to supervised decouple common features and specific features related to fatty liver in abdominal ultrasound images. Subsequently, the decoupled features are concatenated with the original image after transforming the color space and are fed into the classifier. During adversarial training, we adaptively adjust the perturbation and balance the adversarial strength by the accuracy of each class. The model will eliminate recognition weaknesses by correctly classifying adversarial samples, thus improving recognition robustness. Finally, the accuracy of our method improved by 4.16%, achieving 82.95%. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, our method is a generalized learning framework that can be directly used to eliminate the recognition weaknesses of any classifier while improving its average performance.

      <title>Deep learning-based brain segmentation model performance validation with clinical radiotherapy CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual segmentation of medical images is labor intensive and especially challenging for images with poor contrast or resolution. The presence of disease exacerbates this further, increasing the need for an automated solution. To this extent, SynthSeg is a robust deep learning model designed for automatic brain segmentation across various contrasts and resolutions. This study validates the SynthSeg robust brain segmentation model on computed tomography (CT), using a multi-center dataset. An open access dataset of 260 paired CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from radiotherapy patients treated in 5 centers was collected. Brain segmentations from CT and MRI were obtained with SynthSeg model, a component of the Freesurfer imaging suite. These segmentations were compared and evaluated using Dice scores and Hausdorff 95 distance (HD95), treating MRI-based segmentations as the ground truth. Brain regions that failed to meet performance criteria were excluded based on automated quality control (QC) scores. Dice scores indicate a median overlap of 0.76 (IQR: 0.65-0.83). The median HD95 is 2.95 mm (IQR: 1.73-5.39). QC score based thresholding improves median dice by 0.1 and median HD95 by 0.05mm. Morphological differences related to sex and age, as detected by MRI, were also replicated with CT, with an approximate 17% difference between the CT and MRI results for sex and 10% difference between the results for age. SynthSeg can be utilized for CT-based automatic brain segmentation, but only in applications where precision is not essential. CT performance is lower than MRI based on the integrated QC scores, but low-quality segmentations can be excluded with QC-based thresholding. Additionally, performing CT-based neuroanatomical studies is encouraged, as the results show correlations in sex- and age-based analyses similar to those found with MRI.</description>

      <title>Medical Image Segmentation Using Directional Window Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of medical images is crucial for diagnostic purposes, including cell segmentation, tumor identification, and organ localization. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches struggled to achieve precise segmentation results due to their limited receptive fields, particularly in cases involving multi-organ segmentation with varying shapes and sizes. The transformer-based approaches address this limitation by leveraging the global receptive field, but they often face challenges in capturing local information required for pixel-precise segmentation. In this work, we introduce DwinFormer, a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture for medical image segmentation comprising a directional window (Dwin) attention and global self-attention (GSA) for feature encoding. The focus of our design is the introduction of Dwin block within DwinFormer that effectively captures local and global information along the horizontal, vertical, and depthwise directions of the input feature map by separately performing attention in each of these directional volumes. To this end, our Dwin block introduces a nested Dwin attention (NDA) that progressively increases the receptive field in horizontal, vertical, and depthwise directions and a convolutional Dwin attention (CDA) that captures local contextual information for the attention computation. While the proposed Dwin block captures local and global dependencies at the first two high-resolution stages of DwinFormer, the GSA block encodes global dependencies at the last two lower-resolution stages. Experiments over the challenging 3D Synapse Multi-organ dataset and Cell HMS dataset demonstrate the benefits of our DwinFormer over the state-of-the-art approaches. Our source code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Daniyanaj/DWINFORMER}.</description>

      <title>MedMNIST-C: Comprehensive benchmark and improved classifier robustness by simulating realistic image corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of neural-network-based systems into clinical practice is limited by challenges related to domain generalization and robustness. The computer vision community established benchmarks such as ImageNet-C as a fundamental prerequisite to measure progress towards those challenges. Similar datasets are largely absent in the medical imaging community which lacks a comprehensive benchmark that spans across imaging modalities and applications. To address this gap, we create and open-source MedMNIST-C, a benchmark dataset based on the MedMNIST+ collection covering 12 datasets and 9 imaging modalities. We simulate task and modality-specific image corruptions of varying severity to comprehensively evaluate the robustness of established algorithms against real-world artifacts and distribution shifts. We further provide quantitative evidence that our simple-to-use artificial corruptions allow for highly performant, lightweight data augmentation to enhance model robustness. Unlike traditional, generic augmentation strategies, our approach leverages domain knowledge, exhibiting significantly higher robustness when compared to widely adopted methods. By introducing MedMNIST-C and open-sourcing the corresponding library allowing for targeted data augmentations, we contribute to the development of increasingly robust methods tailored to the challenges of medical imaging.

      <title>Advancing Cell Detection in Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anterior uveitis, a common form of eye inflammation, can lead to permanent vision loss if not promptly diagnosed. Monitoring this condition involves quantifying inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber (AC) of the eye, which can be captured using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT). However, manually identifying cells in AS-OCT images is time-consuming and subjective. Moreover, existing automated approaches may have limitations in both the effectiveness of detecting cells and the reliability of their detection results. To address these challenges, we propose an automated framework to detect cells in the AS-OCT images. This framework consists of a zero-shot chamber segmentation module and a cell detection module. The first module segments the AC area in the image without requiring human-annotated training data. Subsequently, the second module identifies individual cells within the segmented AC region. Through experiments, our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods for both AC segmentation and cell detection tasks. Notably, we find that previous cell detection approaches could suffer from low recall, potentially overlooking a significant number of cells. In contrast, our framework offers an improved solution, which could benefit the diagnosis and study of anterior uveitis. Our code for cell detection is publicly available at: https://github.com/joeybyc/cell_detection.</description>

      <title>Sparse-view Signal-domain Photoacoustic Tomography Reconstruction Method Based on Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography is a hybrid biomedical technology, which combines the advantages of acoustic and optical imaging. However, for the conventional image reconstruction method, the image quality is affected obviously by artifacts under the condition of sparse sampling. in this paper, a novel model-based sparse reconstruction method via implicit neural representation was proposed for improving the image quality reconstructed from sparse data. Specially, the initial acoustic pressure distribution was modeled as a continuous function of spatial coordinates, and parameterized by a multi-layer perceptron. The weights of multi-layer perceptron were determined by training the network in self-supervised manner. And the total variation regularization term was used to offer the prior knowledge. We compared our result with some ablation studies, and the results show that out method outperforms existing methods on simulation and experimental data. Under the sparse sampling condition, our method can suppress the artifacts and avoid the ill-posed problem effectively, which reconstruct images with higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio than traditional methods. The high-quality results for sparse data make the proposed method hold the potential for further decreasing the hardware cost of photoacoustic tomography system.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based segmentation of adnexal lesions and ovarian implants in CT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two self-supervised pretrained transformer-based segmentation models (SMIT and Swin UNETR) fine-tuned on a dataset of ovarian cancer CT images provided reasonably accurate delineations of the tumors in an independent test dataset. Tumors in the adnexa were segmented more accurately by both transformers (SMIT and Swin UNETR) than the omental implants. AI-assisted labeling performed on 72 out of 245 omental implants resulted in smaller manual editing effort of 39.55 mm compared to full manual correction of partial labels of 106.49 mm and resulted in overall improved accuracy performance. Both SMIT and Swin UNETR did not generate any false detection of omental metastases in the urinary bladder and relatively few false detections in the small bowel, with 2.16 cc on average for SMIT and 7.37 cc for Swin UNETR respectively.</description>

      <title>Brain Tumor Classification using Vision Transformer with Selective Cross-Attention Mechanism and Feature Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor classification is a challenging task in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to brain tumor classification using a vision transformer with a novel cross-attention mechanism. Our approach leverages the strengths of transformers in modeling long-range dependencies and multi-scale feature fusion. We introduce two new mechanisms to improve the performance of the cross-attention fusion module: Feature Calibration Mechanism (FCM) and Selective Cross-Attention (SCA). FCM calibrates the features from different branches to make them more compatible, while SCA selectively attends to the most informative features. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in brain tumor classification, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency. The proposed FCM and SCA mechanisms can be easily integrated into other vision transformer architectures, making them a promising direction for future research in medical image analysis. Experimental results confirm that our approach surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Mask-Guided Attention U-Net for Enhanced Neonatal Brain Extraction and Image Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce MGA-Net, a novel mask-guided attention neural network, which extends the U-net model for precision neonatal brain imaging. MGA-Net is designed to extract the brain from other structures and reconstruct high-quality brain images. The network employs a common encoder and two decoders: one for brain mask extraction and the other for brain region reconstruction. A key feature of MGA-Net is its high-level mask-guided attention module, which leverages features from the brain mask decoder to enhance image reconstruction. To enable the same encoder and decoder to process both MRI and ultrasound (US) images, MGA-Net integrates sinusoidal positional encoding. This encoding assigns distinct positional values to MRI and US images, allowing the model to effectively learn from both modalities. Consequently, features learned from a single modality can aid in learning a modality with less available data, such as US. We extensively validated the proposed MGA-Net on diverse datasets from varied clinical settings and neonatal age groups. The metrics used for assessment included the DICE similarity coefficient, recall, and accuracy for image segmentation; structural similarity for image reconstruction; and root mean squared error for total brain volume estimation from 3D ultrasound images. Our results demonstrate that MGA-Net significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering superior performance in brain extraction and segmentation while achieving high precision in image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Thus, MGA-Net represents a robust and effective preprocessing tool for MRI and 3D ultrasound images, marking a significant advance in neuroimaging that enhances both research and clinical diagnostics in the neonatal period and beyond.</description>

      <title>Expansive Synthesis: Generating Large-Scale Datasets from Minimal Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of limited availability of data for training in machine learning arises in many applications and the impact on performance and generalization is serious. Traditional data augmentation methods aim to enhance training with a moderately sufficient data set. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) often face problematic convergence when generating significant and diverse data samples. Diffusion models, though effective, still struggle with high computational cost and long training times. This paper introduces an innovative Expansive Synthesis model that generates large-scale, high-fidelity datasets from minimal samples. The proposed approach exploits expander graph mappings and feature interpolation to synthesize expanded datasets while preserving the intrinsic data distribution and feature structural relationships. The rationale of the model is rooted in the non-linear property of neural networks' latent space and in its capture by a Koopman operator to yield a linear space of features to facilitate the construction of larger and enriched consistent datasets starting with a much smaller dataset. This process is optimized by an autoencoder architecture enhanced with self-attention layers and further refined for distributional consistency by optimal transport. We validate our Expansive Synthesis by training classifiers on the generated datasets and comparing their performance to classifiers trained on larger, original datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that classifiers trained on synthesized data achieve performance metrics on par with those trained on full-scale datasets, showcasing the model's potential to effectively augment training data. This work represents a significant advancement in data generation, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and paving the way for enhanced data availability in machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>HD snapshot diffractive spectral imaging and inferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel high-definition (HD) snapshot diffractive spectral imaging system utilizing a diffractive filter array (DFA) to capture a single image that encodes both spatial and spectral information. This single diffractogram can be computationally reconstructed into a spectral image cube, providing a high-resolution representation of the scene across 25 spectral channels in the 440-800 nm range at 1304x744 spatial pixels (~1 MP). This unique approach offers numerous advantages including snapshot capture, a form of optical compression, flexible offline reconstruction, the ability to select the spectral basis after capture, and high light throughput due to the absence of lossy filters. We demonstrate a 30-50 nm spectral resolution and compared our reconstructed spectra against ground truth obtained by conventional spectrometers. Proof-of-concept experiments in diverse applications including biological tissue classification, food quality assessment, and simulated stellar photometry validate our system's capability to perform robust and accurate inference. These results establish the DFA-based imaging system as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing scientific and industrial imaging applications.</description>

      <title>UHD-IQA Benchmark Database: Pushing the Boundaries of Blind Photo Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Image Quality Assessment (IQA) dataset comprising 6073 UHD-1 (4K) images, annotated at a fixed width of 3840 pixels. Contrary to existing No-Reference (NR) IQA datasets, ours focuses on highly aesthetic photos of high technical quality, filling a gap in the literature. The images, carefully curated to exclude synthetic content, are sufficiently diverse to train general NR-IQA models. The dataset is annotated with perceptual quality ratings obtained through a crowdsourcing study. Ten expert raters, comprising photographers and graphics artists, assessed each image at least twice in multiple sessions spanning several days, resulting in highly reliable labels. Annotators were rigorously selected based on several metrics, including self-consistency, to ensure their reliability. The dataset includes rich metadata with user and machine-generated tags from over 5,000 categories and popularity indicators such as favorites, likes, downloads, and views. With its unique characteristics, such as its focus on high-quality images, reliable crowdsourced annotations, and high annotation resolution, our dataset opens up new opportunities for advancing perceptual image quality assessment research and developing practical NR-IQA models that apply to modern photos. Our dataset is available at https://database.mmsp-kn.de/uhd-iqa-benchmark-database.html</description>

      <title>TRIP: Trainable Region-of-Interest Prediction for Hardware-Efficient Neuromorphic Processing on Event-based Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic processors are well-suited for efficiently handling sparse events from event-based cameras. However, they face significant challenges in the growth of computing demand and hardware costs as the input resolution increases. This paper proposes the Trainable Region-of-Interest Prediction (TRIP), the first hardware-efficient hard attention framework for event-based vision processing on a neuromorphic processor. Our TRIP framework actively produces low-resolution Region-of-Interest (ROIs) for efficient and accurate classification. The framework exploits sparse events' inherent low information density to reduce the overhead of ROI prediction. We introduced extensive hardware-aware optimizations for TRIP and implemented the hardware-optimized algorithm on the SENECA neuromorphic processor. We utilized multiple event-based classification datasets for evaluation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracies in all datasets and produces reasonable ROIs with varying locations and sizes. On the DvsGesture dataset, our solution requires 46x less computation than the state-of-the-art while achieving higher accuracy. Furthermore, TRIP enables more than 2x latency and energy improvements on the SENECA neuromorphic processor compared to the conventional solution.</description>

      <title>Embedded event based object detection with spiking neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of event-based object detection (OD) poses considerable challenges. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promising results and pave the way for efficient event-based OD. Despite this success, the path to efficient SNNs on embedded devices remains a challenge. This is due to the size of the networks required to accomplish the task and the ability of devices to take advantage of SNNs benefits. Even when "edge" devices are considered, they typically use embedded GPUs that consume tens of watts. In response to these challenges, our research introduces an embedded neuromorphic testbench that utilizes the SPiking Low-power Event-based ArchiTecture (SPLEAT) accelerator. Using an extended version of the Qualia framework, we can train, evaluate, quantize, and deploy spiking neural networks on an FPGA implementation of SPLEAT. We used this testbench to load a state-of-the-art SNN solution, estimate the performance loss associated with deploying the network on dedicated hardware, and run real-world event-based OD on neuromorphic hardware specifically designed for low-power spiking neural networks. Remarkably, our embedded spiking solution, which includes a model with 1.08 million parameters, operates efficiently with 490 mJ per prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skin cancer poses a significant public health challenge, necessitating efficient diagnostic tools. We introduce UCM-Net, a novel skin lesion segmentation model combining Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This lightweight, efficient architecture, deviating from traditional UNet designs, dramatically reduces computational demands, making it ideal for mobile health applications. Evaluated on PH2, ISIC 2017, and ISIC 2018 datasets, UCM-Net demonstrates robust performance with fewer than 50KB parameters and requires less than 0.05 Giga Operations Per Second (GLOPs). Moreover, its minimal memory requirement is just 1.19MB in CPU environment positions. It is a potential benchmark for efficiency in skin lesion segmentation, suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings. In order to facilitate accessibility and further research in the field, the UCM-Net source code is https://github.com/chunyuyuan/UCM-Net.</description>

Abstract: Clinical dermatology necessitates precision and innovation for efficient diagnosis and treatment of various skin conditions. This paper introduces the development of a cutting-edge hyperspectral dermatoscope (the Hyperscope) tailored for human skin analysis. We detail the requirements to such a device and the design considerations, from optical configurations to sensor selection, necessary to capture a wide spectral range with high fidelity. Preliminary results from 15 individuals and 160 recorded skin images demonstrate the potential of the Hyperscope in identifying and characterizing various skin conditions, offering a promising avenue for non-invasive skin evaluation and a platform for future research in dermatology-related hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</description>

      <title>MRISegmentator-Abdomen: A Fully Automated Multi-Organ and Structure Segmentation Tool for T1-weighted Abdominal MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Segmentation of organs and structures in abdominal MRI is useful for many clinical applications, such as disease diagnosis and radiotherapy. Current approaches have focused on delineating a limited set of abdominal structures (13 types). To date, there is no publicly available abdominal MRI dataset with voxel-level annotations of multiple organs and structures. Consequently, a segmentation tool for multi-structure segmentation is also unavailable. Methods: We curated a T1-weighted abdominal MRI dataset consisting of 195 patients who underwent imaging at National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. The dataset comprises of axial pre-contrast T1, arterial, venous, and delayed phases for each patient, thereby amounting to a total of 780 series (69,248 2D slices). Each series contains voxel-level annotations of 62 abdominal organs and structures. A 3D nnUNet model, dubbed as MRISegmentator-Abdomen (MRISegmentator in short), was trained on this dataset, and evaluation was conducted on an internal test set and two large external datasets: AMOS22 and Duke Liver. The predicted segmentations were compared against the ground-truth using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Normalized Surface Distance (NSD). Findings: MRISegmentator achieved an average DSC of 0.861$\pm$0.170 and a NSD of 0.924$\pm$0.163 in the internal test set. On the AMOS22 dataset, MRISegmentator attained an average DSC of 0.829$\pm$0.133 and a NSD of 0.908$\pm$0.067. For the Duke Liver dataset, an average DSC of 0.933$\pm$0.015 and a NSD of 0.929$\pm$0.021 was obtained. Interpretation: The proposed MRISegmentator provides automatic, accurate, and robust segmentations of 62 organs and structures in T1-weighted abdominal MRI sequences. The tool has the potential to accelerate research on various clinical topics, such as abnormality detection, radiotherapy, disease classification among others.</description>

      <title>Instance-level quantitative saliency in multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09335</link>

Abstract: In recent years, explainable methods for artificial intelligence (XAI) have tried to reveal and describe models' decision mechanisms in the case of classification tasks. However, XAI for semantic segmentation and in particular for single instances has been little studied to date. Understanding the process underlying automatic segmentation of single instances is crucial to reveal what information was used to detect and segment a given object of interest. In this study, we proposed two instance-level explanation maps for semantic segmentation based on SmoothGrad and Grad-CAM++ methods. Then, we investigated their relevance for the detection and segmentation of white matter lesions (WML), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS). 687 patients diagnosed with MS for a total of 4043 FLAIR and MPRAGE MRI scans were collected at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. Data were randomly split into training, validation and test sets to train a 3D U-Net for MS lesion segmentation. We observed 3050 true positive (TP), 1818 false positive (FP), and 789 false negative (FN) cases. We generated instance-level explanation maps for semantic segmentation, by developing two XAI methods based on SmoothGrad and Grad-CAM++. We investigated: 1) the distribution of gradients in saliency maps with respect to both input MRI sequences; 2) the model's response in the case of synthetic lesions; 3) the amount of perilesional tissue needed by the model to segment a lesion. Saliency maps (based on SmoothGrad) in FLAIR showed positive values inside a lesion and negative in its neighborhood. Peak values of saliency maps generated for these four groups of volumes presented distributions that differ significantly from one another, suggesting a quantitative nature of the proposed saliency. Contextual information of 7mm around the lesion border was required for their segmentation.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Accurate Diagnosis of Acute Aortic Syndrome using Non-contrast CT: A Large-scale, Retrospective, Multi-center and AI-based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chest pain symptoms are highly prevalent in emergency departments (EDs), where acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a catastrophic cardiovascular emergency with a high fatality rate, especially when timely and accurate treatment is not administered. However, current triage practices in the ED can cause up to approximately half of patients with AAS to have an initially missed diagnosis or be misdiagnosed as having other acute chest pain conditions. Subsequently, these AAS patients will undergo clinically inaccurate or suboptimal differential diagnosis. Fortunately, even under these suboptimal protocols, nearly all these patients underwent non-contrast CT covering the aorta anatomy at the early stage of differential diagnosis. In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence model (DeepAAS) using non-contrast CT, which is highly accurate for identifying AAS and provides interpretable results to assist in clinical decision-making. Performance was assessed in two major phases: a multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750) and an exploration in real-world emergency scenarios (n = 137,525). In the multi-center cohort, DeepAAS achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the real-world cohort, DeepAAS detected 109 AAS patients with misguided initial suspicion, achieving 92.6% (95% CI 76.2%-97.5%) in mean sensitivity and 99.2% (95% CI 99.1%-99.3%) in mean specificity. Our AI model performed well on non-contrast CT at all applicable early stages of differential diagnosis workflows, effectively reduced the overall missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis rate from 48.8% to 4.8% and shortened the diagnosis time for patients with misguided initial suspicion from an average of 681.8 (74-11,820) mins to 68.5 (23-195) mins. DeepAAS could effectively fill the gap in the current clinical workflow without requiring additional tests.</description>

      <title>X-ray2CTPA: Generating 3D CTPA scans from 2D X-ray conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chest X-rays or chest radiography (CXR), commonly used for medical diagnostics, typically enables limited imaging compared to computed tomography (CT) scans, which offer more detailed and accurate three-dimensional data, particularly contrast-enhanced scans like CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA). However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools. The code for this project is available: https://github.com/NoaCahan/X-ray2CTPA .</description>

      <title>Sampling Strategies in Bayesian Inversion: A Study of RTO and Langevin Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies two classes of sampling methods for the solution of inverse problems, namely Randomize-Then-Optimize (RTO), which is rooted in sensitivity analysis, and Langevin methods, which are rooted in the Bayesian framework. The two classes of methods correspond to different assumptions and yield samples from different target distributions. We highlight the main conceptual and theoretical differences between the two approaches and compare them from a practical point of view by tackling two classical inverse problems in imaging: deblurring and inpainting. We show that the choice of the sampling method has a significant impact on the quality of the reconstruction and that the RTO method is more robust to the choice of the parameters.</description>

      <title>The Ninth NTIRE 2024 Efficient Super-Resolution Challenge Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the NTIRE 2024 challenge, focusing on efficient single-image super-resolution (ESR) solutions and their outcomes. The task of this challenge is to super-resolve an input image with a magnification factor of x4 based on pairs of low and corresponding high-resolution images. The primary objective is to develop networks that optimize various aspects such as runtime, parameters, and FLOPs, while still maintaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of approximately 26.90 dB on the DIV2K_LSDIR_valid dataset and 26.99 dB on the DIV2K_LSDIR_test dataset. In addition, this challenge has 4 tracks including the main track (overall performance), sub-track 1 (runtime), sub-track 2 (FLOPs), and sub-track 3 (parameters). In the main track, all three metrics (ie runtime, FLOPs, and parameter count) were considered. The ranking of the main track is calculated based on a weighted sum-up of the scores of all other sub-tracks. In sub-track 1, the practical runtime performance of the submissions was evaluated, and the corresponding score was used to determine the ranking. In sub-track 2, the number of FLOPs was considered. The score calculated based on the corresponding FLOPs was used to determine the ranking. In sub-track 3, the number of parameters was considered. The score calculated based on the corresponding parameters was used to determine the ranking. RLFN is set as the baseline for efficiency measurement. The challenge had 262 registered participants, and 34 teams made valid submissions. They gauge the state-of-the-art in efficient single-image super-resolution. To facilitate the reproducibility of the challenge and enable other researchers to build upon these findings, the code and the pre-trained model of validated solutions are made publicly available at https://github.com/Amazingren/NTIRE2024_ESR/.</description>

      <title>ECLIPSE: Expunging Clean-label Indiscriminate Poisons via Sparse Diffusion Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clean-label indiscriminate poisoning attacks add invisible perturbations to correctly labeled training images, thus dramatically reducing the generalization capability of the victim models. Recently, some defense mechanisms have been proposed such as adversarial training, image transformation techniques, and image purification. However, these schemes are either susceptible to adaptive attacks, built on unrealistic assumptions, or only effective against specific poison types, limiting their universal applicability. In this research, we propose a more universally effective, practical, and robust defense scheme called ECLIPSE. We first investigate the impact of Gaussian noise on the poisons and theoretically prove that any kind of poison will be largely assimilated when imposing sufficient random noise. In light of this, we assume the victim has access to an extremely limited number of clean images (a more practical scene) and subsequently enlarge this sparse set for training a denoising probabilistic model (a universal denoising tool). We then begin by introducing Gaussian noise to absorb the poisons and then apply the model for denoising, resulting in a roughly purified dataset. Finally, to address the trade-off of the inconsistency in the assimilation sensitivity of different poisons by Gaussian noise, we propose a lightweight corruption compensation module to effectively eliminate residual poisons, providing a more universal defense approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our defense approach outperforms 10 state-of-the-art defenses. We also propose an adaptive attack against ECLIPSE and verify the robustness of our defense scheme. Our code is available at https://github.com/CGCL-codes/ECLIPSE.</description>

      <title>CEST-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for CEST MRI Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to propose and investigate the feasibility of using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for CEST MRI data analysis (CEST-KAN). Methods: CEST MRI data were acquired from twelve healthy volunteers at 3T. Data from ten subjects were used for training, while the remaining two were reserved for testing. The performance of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and KAN models with the same network settings were evaluated and compared to the conventional multi-pool Lorentzian fitting (MPLF) method in generating water and multiple CEST contrasts, including amide, relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE), and magnetization transfer (MT). Results: The water and CEST maps generated by both MLP and KAN were visually comparable to the MPLF results. However, the KAN model demonstrated higher accuracy in extrapolating the CEST fitting metrics, as evidenced by the smaller validation loss during training and smaller absolute error during testing. Voxel-wise correlation analysis showed that all four CEST fitting metrics generated by KAN consistently exhibited higher Pearson coefficients than the MLP results, indicating superior performance. Moreover, the KAN models consistently outperformed the MLP models in varying hidden layer numbers despite longer training time. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of utilizing KAN for CEST MRI data analysis, highlighting its superiority over MLP in this task. The findings suggest that CEST-KAN has the potential to be a robust and reliable post-analysis tool for CEST MRI in clinical settings.</description>
