      <title>Nonlinear Voltage Regulation of an Auxiliary Energy Storage of a Multiport Interconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a nonlinear voltage control to ensure power exchange in a multiport interconnected system, which consists of a bidirectional DC-DC converter and generating-storing devices. The converter topology under consideration is two-stage, composed of an interconnection of a buck with a boost converter. The motivation for this work is the explosive increase in the use of DC-DC converters due to the massification of renewable energies, electric vehicles powertrains, and energy storage systems, where fuel cells or batteries can be used as power backup or high-power support during transient phenomena. The converter's voltage step-up and step-down capabilities allow the use of supercapacitors with voltage limits that exceed those required by the load, thus enabling its use in a broader range of applications. The control design for this system does not correspond to that in standard applications involving power converters. As it is known, the latter consists of finding a control law such that the closed-loop system has an asymptotically stable equilibrium point fulfilling the voltage regulation objectives. Instead, in this application, the state does not tend to an equilibrium value in order for the system to be regulated. The converter voltage is regulated at desired some setpoint whereas the other variables are only required to be bounded. To achieve a dynamic response that best adapts to changes in system demand and ensure stability over the defined wide operating range we propose a novel control strategy that exploits the partially cascaded structure of the system. Numerical and experimental results validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Keeping Up With the Winner! Targeted Advertisement to Communities in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a new product enters a market already dominated by an existing product, will it survive along with this dominant product? Most of the existing works have shown the coexistence of two competing products spreading/being adopted on overlaid graphs with same set of users. However, when it comes to the survival of a weaker product on the same graph, it has been established that the stronger one dominates the market and wipes out the other. This paper makes a step towards narrowing this gap so that a new/weaker product can also survive along with its competitor with a positive market share. Specifically, we identify a locally optimal set of users to induce a community that is targeted with advertisement by the product launching company under a given budget constraint. To this end, we model the system as competing Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemics and employ perturbation techniques to quantify and attain a positive market share in a cost-efficient manner. Our extensive simulation results with real-world graph dataset show that with our choice of target users, a new product can establish itself with positive market share, which otherwise would be dominated and eventually wiped out of the competitive market under the same budget constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies quadcopters obstacle avoidance trajectory control (OATC) problem for express delivery. A new nonlinear adaptive learning controller that is low-cost and portable to different wheelbase sizes is proposed to adapt to large-angle maneuvers and load changes in UAV delivery missions. The controller consists of a nonlinear variable gain (NLVG) function and an extreme value search (ES) algorithm to reduce overshoot and settling time. Finally, simulations were conducted on a quadcopter to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under two typical collision-free trajectories.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Signal Distortion in Molecular Communication Channels Using Frequency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a concept in communication engineering, where diffusive molecules are used to transmit information between nano or micro-scale chemical reaction systems. Engineering MC to control the reaction systems in cells is expected for many applications such as targeted drug delivery and biocomputing. Toward control of the reaction systems as desired via MC, it is important to transmit signals without distortion by MC since the reaction systems are often triggered depending on the concentration of signaling molecules arriving at the cells. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze signal distortion caused by diffusion-based MC channels using frequency response of channels. The proposed method provides indices that quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of distortion and shows parameter conditions of MC channels that suppress signal distortion. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate the design procedure of specific MC channels that satisfy given specifications. Finally, the roles of MC channels in nature are discussed from the perspective of signal distortion.</description>

      <title>Development of a full-Scale approach to predict overlay reflective crack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resurfacing a moderately deteriorated Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement with asphalt concrete (AC) layers is considered an efficient rehabilitation practice. However, reflective cracks may develop shortly after resurfacing because of discontinuities (e.g. joints and cracks) in existing PCC pavement. In this paper, a new accelerated full-scale testing approach was developed to study reflective crack growth in AC overlays. Two hydraulic actuators were used to simulate a moving dual-tire assembly with a loading rate of more than five-thousand-wheel passes per hour. A load cycle consists of three steps, simulating a tire approaching, moving across, and leaving a PCC discontinuity. Experiments were conducted to compare the reflective crack behaviour of two overlay configurations. Both test sections were fully cracked in less than an hour. The initiation and propagation of reflective cracks were explicitly documented using crack detectors in conjunction with a camera. The proposed full-scale testing protocol offers a repeatable and efficient approach to systematically investigate the effects of various overlay configurations, thus enabling the identification of optimal design against reflective cracking.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based Echo-State Networks: A Step Towards Interpretability and Minimalism in Reservoir Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and interpretable recurrent neural-network structure using the echo-state network (ESN) paradigm for time-series prediction. While the traditional ESNs perform well for dynamical systems prediction, it needs a large dynamic reservoir with increased computational complexity. It also lacks interpretability to discern contributions from different input combinations to the output. Here, a systematic reservoir architecture is developed using smaller parallel reservoirs driven by different input combinations, known as features, and then they are nonlinearly combined to produce the output. The resultant feature-based ESN (Feat-ESN) outperforms the traditional single-reservoir ESN with less reservoir nodes. The predictive capability of the proposed architecture is demonstrated on three systems: two synthetic datasets from chaotic dynamical systems and a set of real-time traffic data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Decentralized Federated Learning in Energy and Latency Constrained Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), with parameter aggregated by a central node, the communication overhead is a substantial concern. To circumvent this limitation and alleviate the single point of failure within the FL framework, recent studies have introduced Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) as a viable alternative. Considering the device heterogeneity, and energy cost associated with parameter aggregation, in this paper, the problem on how to efficiently leverage the limited resources available to enhance the model performance is investigated. Specifically, we formulate a problem that minimizes the loss function of DFL while considering energy and latency constraints. The proposed solution involves optimizing the number of local training rounds across diverse devices with varying resource budgets. To make this problem tractable, we first analyze the convergence of DFL with edge devices with different rounds of local training. The derived convergence bound reveals the impact of the rounds of local training on the model performance. Then, based on the derived bound, the closed-form solutions of rounds of local training in different devices are obtained. Meanwhile, since the solutions require the energy cost of aggregation as low as possible, we modify different graph-based aggregation schemes to solve this energy consumption minimization problem, which can be applied to different communication scenarios. Finally, a DFL framework which jointly considers the optimized rounds of local training and the energy-saving aggregation scheme is proposed. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm achieves a better performance than the conventional schemes with fixed rounds of local training, and consumes less energy than other traditional aggregation schemes.</description>

      <title>Simple inverse kinematics computation considering joint motion efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse kinematics is an important and challenging problem in the operation of industrial manipulators. This study proposes a simple inverse kinematics calculation scheme for an industrial serial manipulator. The proposed technique can calculate appropriate values of the joint variables to realize the desired end-effector position and orientation while considering the motion costs of each joint. Two scalar functions are defined for the joint variables: one is to evaluate the end-effector position and orientation, whereas the other is to evaluate the motion efficiency of the joints. By combining the two scalar functions, the inverse kinematics calculation of the manipulator is formulated as a numerical optimization problem. Furthermore, a simple algorithm for solving the inverse kinematics via the aforementioned optimization is constructed on the basis of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation with a norm-limited update vector (NLSPSA). The proposed scheme considers not only the accuracy of the position and orientation of the end-effector but also the efficiency of the robot movement. Therefore, it yields a practical result of the inverse problem. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement owing to the high calculation efficiency of NLSPSA. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical examples using a redundant manipulator.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Stochastic Decision-Making of PV Power in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of conformal prediction (CP), an emerging probabilistic forecasting method, for day-ahead photovoltaic power predictions to enhance participation in electricity markets. First, machine learning models are used to construct point predictions. Thereafter, several variants of CP are implemented to quantify the uncertainty of those predictions by creating CP intervals and cumulative distribution functions. Optimal quantity bids for the electricity market are estimated using several bidding strategies under uncertainty, namely: trust-the-forecast, worst-case, Newsvendor and expected utility maximization (EUM). Results show that CP in combination with k-nearest neighbors and/or Mondrian binning outperforms its corresponding linear quantile regressors. Using CP in combination with certain bidding strategies can yield high profit with minimal energy imbalance. In concrete, using conformal predictive systems with k-nearest neighbors and Mondrian binning after random forest regression yields the best profit and imbalance regardless of the decision-making strategy. Combining this uncertainty quantification method with the EUM strategy with conditional value at risk (CVaR) can yield up to 93\% of the potential profit with minimal energy imbalance.</description>

      <title>Minimizing End-to-End Latency for Joint Source-Channel Coding Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While existing studies have highlighted the advantages of deep learning (DL)-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) schemes in enhancing transmission efficiency, they often overlook the crucial aspect of resource management during the deployment phase. In this paper, we propose an approach to minimize the transmission latency in an uplink JSCC-based system. We first analyze the correlation between end-to-end latency and task performance, based on which the end-to-end delay model for each device is established. Then, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem aiming at minimizing the maximum end-to-end latency across all devices, which is proved to be NP-hard. We then transform the original problem into a more tractable one, from which we derive the closed form solution on the optimal compression ratio, truncation threshold selection policy, and resource allocation strategy. We further introduce a heuristic algorithm with low complexity, leveraging insights from the structure of the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that both the proposed optimal algorithm and the heuristic algorithm significantly reduce end-to-end latency. Notably, the proposed heuristic algorithm achieves nearly the same performance to the optimal solution but with considerably lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Fixed-Time Stabilization of Stochastic Systems under Measurement Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of risk-aware fixed-time stabilization of a class of uncertain, output-feedback nonlinear systems modeled via stochastic differential equations. First, novel classes of certificate functions, namely risk-aware fixed-time- and risk-aware path-integral-control Lyapunov functions, are introduced. Then, it is shown how the use of either for control design certifies that a system is both stable in probability and probabilistically fixed-time convergent (for a given probability) to a goal set. That is, the system trajectories probabilistically reach the set within a finite time, independent of the initial condition, despite the additional presence of measurement noise. These methods represent an improvement over the state-of-the-art in stochastic fixed-time stabilization, which presently offers bounds on the settling-time function in expectation only. The theoretical results are verified by an empirical study on an illustrative, stochastic, nonlinear system and the proposed controllers are evaluated against an existing method. Finally, the methods are demonstrated via a simulated fixed-wing aerial robot on a reach-avoid scenario to highlight their ability to certify the probability that a system safely reaches its goal.</description>

      <title>Invertibility of Discrete-Time Linear Systems with Sparse Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of interest for discrete-time linear systems is whether its input sequence may be recovered given its output sequence, a.k.a. the left inversion problem. Many conditions on the state space geometry, dynamics, and spectral structure of a system have been used to characterize the well-posedness of this problem, without assumptions on the inputs. However, certain structural assumptions, such as input sparsity, have been shown to translate to practical gains in the performance of inversion algorithms, surpassing classical guarantees. Establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for left invertibility of systems with sparse inputs is therefore a crucial step toward understanding the performance limits of system inversion under structured input assumptions. In this work, we provide the first necessary and sufficient characterizations of left invertibility for linear systems with sparse inputs, echoing classic characterizations for standard linear systems. The key insight in deriving these results is in establishing the existence of two novel geometric invariants unique to the sparse-input setting, the weakly unobservable and strongly reachable subspace arrangements. By means of a concrete example, we demonstrate the utility of these characterizations. We conclude by discussing extensions and applications of this framework to several related problems in sparse control.</description>

      <title>Orbital Facility Location Problem for Satellite Constellation Servicing Depots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an adaptation of the Facility Location Problem for the optimal placement of on-orbit servicing depots for satellite constellations in high-altitude orbit. The high-altitude regime, such as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), is a unique dynamical environment where existing low-thrust propulsion systems can provide the necessary thrust to conduct plane-change maneuvers between the various orbital planes of the constellation. As such, on-orbit servicing architectures involving servicer spacecraft that conduct round-trips between servicing depots and the client satellites of the constellation may be conceived. To this end, orbital facility location problem is a binary linear program, where the costs of operating and allocating the facility(ies) to satellites are considered in terms of the sum of Equivalent Mass to Low Earth Orbit (EMLEO), is proposed. The low-thrust transfers between the facilities and the clients are computed using a parallel implementation of a Lyapunov feedback controller. The total launch cost of the depot along with its servicers, propellant, and payload are taken into account as the cost to establish a given depot. The proposed approach is applied to designing on-orbit servicing depots for the Galileo and the GPS constellations.</description>

Abstract: The problem of coverage control, i.e., of coordinating multiple agents to optimally cover an area, arises in various applications. However, coverage applications face two major challenges: (1) dealing with nonlinear dynamics while respecting system and safety critical constraints, and (2) performing the task in an initially unknown environment. We solve the coverage problem by using a hierarchical framework, in which references are calculated at a central server and passed to the agents' local model predictive control (MPC) tracking schemes. Furthermore, to ensure that the environment is actively explored by the agents a probabilistic exploration-exploitation trade-off is deployed. In addition, we derive a control framework that avoids the hierarchical structure by integrating the reference optimization in the MPC formulation. Active learning is then performed drawing inspiration from Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) approaches. For all developed control architectures, we guarantee closed-loop constraint satisfaction and convergence to an optimal configuration. Furthermore, all methods are tested and compared on hardware using a miniature car platform.</description>

      <title>Online learning for robust voltage control under uncertain grid topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid's topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.</description>

      <title>Feature-Driven Strategies for Trading Wind Power and Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a feature-driven model for hybrid power plants, enabling them to exploit available contextual information such as historical forecasts of wind power, and make optimal wind power and hydrogen trading decisions in the day-ahead stage. For that, we develop different variations of feature-driven linear policies, including a variation where policies depend on price domains, resulting in a price-quantity bidding curve. In addition, we propose a real-time adjustment strategy for hydrogen production. Our numerical results show that the final profit obtained from our proposed feature-driven trading mechanism in the day-ahead stage together with the real-time adjustment strategy is very close to that in an ideal benchmark with perfect information.</description>

      <title>Credit vs. Discount-Based Congestion Pricing: A Comparison Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tolling, or congestion pricing, offers a promising traffic management policy for regulating congestion, but has also attracted criticism for placing outsized financial burdens on low-income users. Credit-based congestion pricing (CBCP) and discount-based congestion pricing (DBCP) policies, which respectively provide travel credits and toll discounts to low-income users on tolled roads, have emerged as promising mechanisms for reducing traffic congestion without worsening societal inequities. However, the optimal design of CBCP and DBCP policies, as well as their relative advantages and disadvantages, remain poorly understood. To address this, we study the effects of implementing CBCP and DBCP policies to route users on a network of multi-lane highways with tolled express lanes. We formulate a non-atomic routing game framework in which a subset of eligible users is granted toll relief in the form of a fixed budget or toll discount, while the remaining ineligible users must pay out-of-pocket. We prove the existence of Nash equilibrium traffic flow patterns corresponding to any given CBCP or DBCP policy. Under the additional assumption that eligible users have time-invariant VoTs, we provide a convex program to efficiently compute these equilibria. For networks consisting of a single edge, we identify conditions under which CBCP policies outperform DBCP policies (and vice versa), in the sense of improving eligible users' access to the express lane. Finally, we present empirical results from a CBCP pilot study of the San Mateo 101 Express Lane Project in California. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical analysis of the impact of deploying credit-based and discount-based policies, and lend insights into the sensitivity of their impact with respect to the travel demand and users' VoTs.</description>

      <title>Prioritize Team Actions: Multi-Agent Temporal Logic Task Planning with Ordering Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of linear temporal logic (LTL) path planning for multi-agent systems, introducing the new concept of \emph{ordering constraints}. Specifically, we consider a generic objective function that is defined for the path of each individual agent. The primary objective is to find a global plan for the team of agents, ensuring they collectively meet the specified LTL requirements. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain a pre-determined order in the values of the objective function for each agent, which we refer to as the ordering constraints. This new requirement stems from scenarios like security-aware planning, where relative orders outweigh absolute values in importance. We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, supported by proofs of correctness that demonstrate the optimality of our solution. Additionally, we provide a case study in security-aware path planning to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Implicit Tracking-Based Distributed Constraint-Coupled Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of distributed optimization problem with a globally coupled equality constraint and local constrained sets is studied in this paper. For its special case where local constrained sets are absent, an augmented primal-dual gradient dynamics is proposed and analyzed, but it cannot be implemented distributedly since the violation of the coupled constraint needs to be used. Benefiting from the brand-new comprehending of a classical distributed unconstrained optimization algorithm, the novel implicit tracking approach is proposed to track the violation distributedly, which leads to the birth of the \underline{i}mplicit tracking-based \underline{d}istribut\underline{e}d \underline{a}ugmented primal-dual gradient dynamics (IDEA). A projected variant of IDEA, i.e., Proj-IDEA, is further designed to deal with the general case where local constrained sets exist. With the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory, the convergences of IDEA and Pro-IDEA over undigraphs and digraphs are analyzed respectively. As far as we know, Proj-IDEA is the first constant step-size distributed algorithm which can solve the studied problem without the need of the strict convexity of local cost functions. Besides, if local cost functions are strongly convex and smooth, IDEA can achieve exponential convergence with a weaker condition about the coupled constraint. Finally, numerical experiments are taken to corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Indirect Swarm Control: Characterization and Analysis of Emergent Swarm Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergence and emergent behaviors are often defined as cases where changes in local interactions between agents at a lower level effectively changes what occurs in the higher level of the system (i.e., the whole swarm) and its properties. However, the manner in which these collective emergent behaviors self-organize is less understood. The focus of this paper is in presenting a new framework for characterizing the conditions that lead to different macrostates and how to predict/analyze their macroscopic properties, allowing us to indirectly engineer the same behaviors from the bottom up by tuning their environmental conditions rather than local interaction rules. We then apply this framework to a simple system of binary sensing and acting agents as an example to see if a re-framing of this swarms problem can help us push the state of the art forward. By first creating some working definitions of macrostates in a particular swarm system, we show how agent-based modeling may be combined with control theory to enable a generalized understanding of controllable emergent processes without needing to simulate everything. Whereas phase diagrams can generally only be created through Monte Carlo simulations or sweeping through ranges of parameters in a simulator, we develop closed-form functions that can immediately produce them revealing an infinite set of swarm parameter combinations that can lead to a specifically chosen self-organized behavior. While the exact methods are still under development, we believe simply laying out a potential path towards solutions that have evaded our traditional methods using a novel method is worth considering. Our results are characterized through both simulations and real experiments on ground robots.</description>

      <title>An Anomaly Behavior Analysis Framework for Securing Autonomous Vehicle Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a rapidly growing cyber-physical platform, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are encountering more security challenges as their capabilities continue to expand. In recent years, adversaries are actively targeting the perception sensors of autonomous vehicles with sophisticated attacks that are not easily detected by the vehicles' control systems. This work proposes an Anomaly Behavior Analysis approach to detect a perception sensor attack against an autonomous vehicle. The framework relies on temporal features extracted from a physics-based autonomous vehicle behavior model to capture the normal behavior of vehicular perception in autonomous driving. By employing a combination of model-based techniques and machine learning algorithms, the proposed framework distinguishes between normal and abnormal vehicular perception behavior. To demonstrate the application of the framework in practice, we performed a depth camera attack experiment on an autonomous vehicle testbed and generated an extensive dataset. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using this real-world data and released the dataset for public access. To our knowledge, this dataset is the first of its kind and will serve as a valuable resource for the research community in evaluating their intrusion detection techniques effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in using price signals to coordinate the electricity consumption of a group of users is the operator's lack of knowledge of the users due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we develop a two-time-scale incentive mechanism that alternately updates between the users and a system operator. As long as the users can optimize their own consumption subject to a given price, the operator does not need to know or attempt to learn any private information of the users for price design. Users adjust their consumption following the price and the system redesigns the price based on the users' consumption. We show that under mild assumptions, this iterative process converges to the social welfare solution. In particular, the cost of the users need not always be convex and its consumption can be the output of a machine learning-based load control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Feedback Optimization via Sensitivity Decoupling: Stability and Sub-optimality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online feedback optimization is a controller design paradigm for optimizing the steady-state behavior of a dynamical system. It employs an optimization algorithm as a dynamic feedback controller and utilizes real-time measurements to bypass knowing exact plant dynamics and disturbances. Different from existing centralized settings, we present a fully decentralized feedback optimization controller for networked systems to lift the communication burden and improve scalability. We approximate the overall input-output sensitivity matrix through its diagonal elements, which capture local model information. For the closed-loop behavior, we characterize the stability and bound the sub-optimality due to decentralization. We prove that the proposed decentralized controller yields solutions that correspond to the Nash equilibria of a non-cooperative game.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safe Formation Control for Coupled Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of research, where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while simultaneously avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our previously developed theory for distributed collaborative safety-critical control for networked dynamic systems, we propose a distributed algorithm for the formation control of robot swarms given individual agent dynamics, induced formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and velocity information within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety guarantees for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors to restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety conditions derived from high-order control barrier functions. We provide conditions under which a swarm is guaranteed to achieve collective safety with respect to multiple obstacles using a modified collaborative safety algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our distributed algorithm via simulation in a simplified physics-based environment.</description>

      <title>DASA: Delay-Adaptive Multi-Agent Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which $N$ agents aim to speedup a common Stochastic Approximation (SA) problem by acting in parallel and communicating with a central server. We assume that the up-link transmissions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. To mitigate the effect of delays and stragglers while reaping the benefits of distributed computation, we propose \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent Stochastic Approximation. We provide a finite-time analysis of \texttt{DASA} assuming that the agents' stochastic observation processes are independent Markov chains. Significantly advancing existing results, \texttt{DASA} is the first algorithm whose convergence rate depends only on the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$ and on the average delay $\tau_{avg}$ while jointly achieving an $N$-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling. Our work is relevant for various SA applications, including multi-agent and distributed temporal difference (TD) learning, Q-learning and stochastic optimization with correlated data.</description>
