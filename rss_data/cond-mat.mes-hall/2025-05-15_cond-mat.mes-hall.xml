      <title>Higher-order Topological Parity Anomaly and Half-integer Hall Effect in High-dimensional Synthetic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in constructing synthetic dimension provide a powerful tool for exploring exotic topological states of matter in high dimensions. Here we report that the parity anomaly and associated \textit{half-integer} quantized Hall conductance, arising in 2$j$+1 (space-time) dimensions with a single or odd number of Dirac cones, can be realized by the boundary states of $n$-th order topological insulators in (2$j$+$n$)-dimensional synthetic lattices. We establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence by integrating the ``nested" Wilson loop theory with the time-reversal polarization at highly-symmetric momenta, a set of $Z_2$ topological invariants are extracted which determines the number of higher-order-boundary Dirac cones and their locations. We develop a general construction procedure for Hamiltonians supporting such higher-order topological parity anomaly. Moreover, we propose an experimental implementation scheme based on photonic synthetic dimensions and provide a method for probing the associated half-integer Hall conductance by the transmission spectra. Our work offers the realization and characterization of parity anomaly in general high-dimensional higher-order topological insulators and opens an avenue for exploring fundamental physics and possible device applications enabled by manipulating Dirac cones.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Spin Waves in Doubly Periodic Magnonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards the development of strategies for tailoring spin-wave band gaps in magnonic crystals, this work examines the band gap properties in a one-dimensional magnonic crystal with double periodicity. A long and narrow yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film strip is etched with an array of transverse groove lines separated by alternating distances, where the second distance is twice the first. This double periodicity in the magnonic crystal translates into dissimilar band gaps in the frequency domain, with the third and sixth band gaps being more pronounced than others. These band gaps are more pronounced because the corresponding wavenumbers simultaneously satisfy the Bragg scattering conditions for the periods equal to the two groove separations as well as their sum. Experimental observations are reproduced by numerical simulations. Together, the experimental and numerical results demonstrate how multiple periodicities could be an effective design parameter for creating magnonic crystals with desired band gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a combination of Majorana edge modes (MEMs) and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) located in the vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors represent a new platform for the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum gates. By calculating the full many-body dynamics of the system, we demonstrate the successful simulation and visualization of $Z$-, $X$- and Hadamard gates, with MEMs being functionalized as quantum memory. Our results open a new platform for the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Ten-valley excitonic complexes in charge-tunable monolayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as monolayer WSe$_2$ is dominated by excitons. Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flat band with zero Chern number, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we present a numerical study to demonstrate the emergence of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such isolated flat band with zero Chern number, which is hosted by a fluxed dice lattice with anisotropic hopping strength. While being topologically trivial, this flat band features an intriguing quantum geometry: the difference between the trace of quantum metric tensor and the Berry curvature is a constant. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure that the isolated band limit is always satisfied, where band renormalization by interaction leaves the flat band quantum geometry unchanged and introduce a tiny band width only. At $2/3$ filling of the isolated flat band, our exact diagonalization calculations show unambiguous evidences for the FCI states, both from the many-body spectra and the many-body Chern number that demonstrates a fractionally quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/3h$. And the 3-fold ground state degeneracy on torus suggests that band-folding Hall crystal scenario is not compatible with the observed $1/3$ quantized Hall conductance at $2/3$ filling. We find the finite dispersion acquired from interaction renormalization, albeit tiny in the isolated band limit, is necessary for FCI to emerge. With anisotropy getting stronger towards the disconnected-chains limit, the FCI undergoes a topological phase transition to inter-chain charge density wave.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced reversal of electromagnetic non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between band topology and material nonlinearity gives rise to a variety of novel phenomena, such as topological solitons and nonlinearity-induced topological phase transitions. However, most previous studies fall within the Hermitian regime, leaving the impact of nonlinearity on non-Hermitian topology seldom explored. Here, we investigate the effects of nonlinearity on the non-Hermitian skin effect, a well-known non-Hermitian phenomenon induced by the point-gap topology unique to non-Hermitian systems. Interestingly, we discover a nonlinearity-induced point-gap topological phase transition accompanied by a reversal of the skin mode localization, which is distinct from previous nonlinearity-induced line-gap topological phases. This phenomenon is experimentally demonstrated in a nonlinear microwave metamaterial, where electromagnetic waves are localized around one end of the sample under a low-intensity pump, whereas at a high-intensity pump, the waves are localized around the other end. Our results open a new route towards nonlinear topological physics in non-Hermitian systems and are promising for reconfigurable topological wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Rashba and Dirac dispersions on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulator decorated with transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac cone originates from the bulk topology, yet its primary contribution comes from the surface since spatially, the Dirac state emerges at the boundary between the trivial and topological phases. At the same time, the Rashba states emerge in regions where inversion symmetry is broken. On the surface of the centrosymmetric topological insulators, both Rashba and Dirac bands are present and their hybridization produces the giant Rashba effect, modifying both Rashba's and Dirac's bands. Therefore, pure Rashba and Dirac fermions are inherently incompatible on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulators if the material is homogeneous. Inspired by recent experiments, we focused on the (111) polar surface of PbSe, which becomes a topological crystalline insulator under compressive strain, and we established the conditions under which a topological system can simultaneously host pure Rashba and Dirac surface states close to the Fermi level. The coexistence of pure Dirac and Rashba dispersions is only possible in a non-homogeneous centrosymmetric topological insulator, where the spatial origins of the two bands are effectively separated. In the experimentally observed case of PbSe, we demonstrate that a metallic overlayer induces a strong electrostatic potential gradient in the subsurface region, which in turn generates the electric field responsible for Rashba splitting in the subsurface layers. Consequently, in PbSe(111), the Rashba states arise from subsurface layers, while the Dirac states live mainly on the surface layers. Finally, we compare the properties of the Rashba in the trivial and topological phases; the calculated Rashba coefficient agrees qualitatively with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Quantum Dot Cavity Placement Using Hyperspectral Imaging with High Spatial Accuracy and Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single emitters in solid state are great sources of single and entangled photons. To boost their extraction efficiency and tailor their emission properties, they are often incorporated in photonic nanostructures. However, achieving accurate and reproducible placement inside the cavity is challenging but necessary to ensure the highest mode overlap and optimal device performance. For many cavity types -- such as photonic crystal cavities or circular Bragg grating cavities -- even small displacements lead to a significantly reduced emitter-cavity coupling. For circular Bragg grating cavities, this yields a significant reduction in Purcell effect, a slight reduction in efficiency and it introduces polarization on the emitted photons. Here we show a method to achieve high accuracy and precision for deterministically placed cavities on the example of circular Bragg gratings on randomly distributed semiconductor quantum dots. We introduce periodic alignment markers for improved marker detection accuracy and investigate overall imaging accuracy achieving $(9.1 \pm 2.5) nm$ through image correction. Since circular Bragg grating cavities exhibit a strong polarization response when the emitter is displaced, they are ideal devices to probe the cavity placement accuracy far below the diffraction limit. From the measured device polarizations, we derive a total spatial process accuracy of $(33.5 \pm 9.9) nm$ based on the raw data, and an accuracy of $(15 \pm 11) nm$ after correcting for the system response, resulting in a device yield of $68 \%$ for well-placed cavities.</description>

      <title>High Chern Number Quantum Anomalous Hall States in Haldane-Graphene Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems with high Chern number ($|C|&gt;1$) are rare. This Letter introduces a Haldane-graphene multilayer heterostructure hosting QAH states with arbitrary Chern number. In a rhombohedral-stacked graphene $N$-layer, the Dirac points at $K_{\pm}$ become $N^\text{th}$-order zeros of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. When an extra layer of Haldane model is stacked on top of the multilayer, the high-order Dirac points are gapped out and the heterostructure enters QAH phases with $|C|=N+1$. Therefore, gapping out high-order Dirac points paves a new way to high Chern number QAH states.</description>

      <title>Spin phase detection by spin current in a chiral helimagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helimagnets, characterized by a helical arrangement of magnetic moments, possess unique internal degrees of freedom, including the spin phase, defined by the phase of the helical magnetic structure. Electrical detection of the spin phase is essential for both practical applications and fundamental research in helimagnets. Here, we demonstrate the electrical detection of the spin phase in a van der Waals nanoscale chiral helimagnet CrNb$_3$S$_6$ using nonlocal spin valve measurements. Due to the short spin diffusion length in CrNb$_3$S$_6$ ($\sim5$~nm), the surface magnetic moment direction, which corresponds to the spin phase, can be detected via spin currents. The experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of the nonlocal spin valve signal is consistent with that of the surface magnetic moment in the helical magnetic structure, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results establish spin currents as a powerful tool for detecting the spin phase in helimagnets, opening avenues for utilizing the spin phase as a novel internal degree of freedom in nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>On-surface Synthesis of a Ferromagnetic Molecular Spin Trimer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangulenes are prototypical examples of open-shell nanographenes. Their magnetic properties, arising from the presence of unpaired $\pi$ electrons, can be extensively tuned by modifying their size and shape or by introducing heteroatoms. Different triangulene derivatives have been designed and synthesized in recent years, thanks to the development of on-surface synthesis strategies. Triangulene-based nanostructures with polyradical character, hosting several interacting spin units, can be challenging to fabricate but are particularly interesting for potential applications in carbon-based spintronics. Here, we combine pristine and N-doped triangulenes into a more complex nanographene, \textbf{TTAT}, predicted to possess three unpaired $\pi$ electrons delocalized along the zigzag periphery. We generate the molecule on an Au(111) surface and detect direct fingerprints of multi-radical coupling and high-spin state using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. With the support of theoretical calculations, we show that its three radical units are localized at distinct parts of the molecule and couple via symmetric ferromagnetic interactions, which result in a $S=3/2$ ground state, thus demonstrating the realization of a molecular ferromagnetic Heisenberg-like spin trimer</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of dark matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth of gold films on the elemental superconductors V(100), Nb(100) and Nb(110)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies require a new generation of superconducting electronic devices and circuitry. However, the superconducting materials used to construct them are restricted to a class of bulk superconductors. Gold films grown in contact with superconducting materials can exhibit superconducting correlations through the proximity effect, with various possible implementations in quantum technology. Here, we study the growth of flat Au films on various surfaces of the elemental superconductors vanadium and niobium through a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In particular, we investigate the growth morphology and composition as a function of temperature and coverage. We find that gold films can grow flat and oxygen-free when annealed to sufficiently high temperatures; however, they are also susceptible to partial intermixing with the substrate elements. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements elucidate the emergence of a proximitized superconducting gap at the gold surface. Additionally, we demonstrate the survival of the magnetic state of FeTPP-Cl molecules on the surface of these gold films, proving that they behave as a good support for probing molecular magnetism. We found that the exchange interaction between the molecular spin and the superconducting condensate can be inferred by the measurement of sub-gap Yu-Shiva-Rusinov states. Our work shows that proximitised Au films constitute a promising platform to explore on-superconducting-surface synthesis and the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism in a large spin-orbit coupling environment.</description>

Abstract: We examine the spectral properties of collective excitations with finite angular momentum $l$ for a system of interacting fermions near a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point, both in the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. Previous studies found that deep in the Fermi liquid regime, the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ behave differently - the latter is suppressed compared to the former because of kinematic constraints on scattering processes. The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Modulated Electrical Switching in an Antiferromagnetic Transistor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin version of transistor, where magnetism is used to influence electrical behaviors of the semiconductor, has been a long-pursued device concept in spintronics. In this work, we experimentally study a field-effect transistor with CrSBr, a van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic semiconductor, as the channel material. Unlike the weak magnetic tunability of in-plane currents previously reported in vdW magnets, the channel current of our transistor is efficiently tuned by both gate voltage and magnetic transitions, achieving a magnetoresistance ratio as high as 1500%. Combining measurement and theoretical modeling, we reveal magnetically modulated carrier concentration as the origin of the large magnetoresistance. The strategy of using both magnetic ordering and electric field in the same device to control ON/OFF states of a transistor opens a new avenue of energy-efficient spintronics for memory, logic and magnetic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Polarization switching in sliding ferroelectrics: the roles of fluctuation and domain wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is highly attractive for its low energy barriers and fatigue resistance. As the origin of these exotic properties, its unconventional switching dynamics remains poorly understood: how an electric field drives a perpendicular sliding? Taking $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, its switching dynamics is studied using \textit{ab initio} calculations. The off-diagonal Born effective charge leads to the perpendicular relationship between the electric field and ionic movements. Interestingly, the rules of intrinsic coercive field are distinct between $h$-BN bilayer and conventional ferroelectrics. For $h$-BN bilayer, any perturbation breaking the in-plane symmetry plays a key role to assist the avalanche-like switching dynamics. Moreover, the exotic large off-diagonal Born effective charge near the $P=0$ intermediate state results in a wriggling motion of domain walls in $h$-BN bilayer. Our results reveal the key factors in the ferroelectric switching of sliding ferroelectrics at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Spin Pumping and Magnetization dynamics in Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/MoS$_2$ stack via interface modification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for realizing spin orbit torque (SOT) based magnetic memory devices. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for such appli cations because of their inherently high SOC strength. In this study, we investigate the spin pumping effect at the interface between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS$_2$) and Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. FMR measurements reveal a notable enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping factor for the ML-MoS$_2$/Py (Pt = 0 nm) interface compared to the reference Py thin films, attributed to spin pumping across the ML-MoS$_2$/Py interface. To further quantify spin pumping efficiency, we introduce a high SOC platinum (Pt) interlayer at the ML-MoS$_2$/Py interface and systematically vary its thickness. This allows us to evaluate key spin transport parameters, including the enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping parameter, the effective spin mixing conductance that reflects the transfer of spin angular momentum from Py to ML-MoS$_2$ and the effective spin current density.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Control of a Strongly Coupled Electro-Nuclear Spin-Photon Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long distance quantum networking requires combining efficient spin-photon interfaces with long-lived local memories. Group-IV color centers in diamond (SiV, GeV, and SnV) are promising candidates for this application, containing an electronic spin-photon interface and dopant nuclear spin memory. Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spin-photon coupling and spin-spin entanglement. However, coupling between the electron and nuclear spins introduces a phase kickback during optical excitation that limits the utility of the nuclear memory. Here, we propose using the large hyperfine coupling of SnV-117 to operate the device at zero magnetic field in a regime where the memory is insensitive to optical excitation. We further demonstrate ground state spin control of a SnV-117 color center integrated in a photonic integrated circuit, showing 97.8% gate fidelity and 2.5 ms coherence time for the memory spin level. This shows the viability of the zero-field protocol for high fidelity operation, and lays the groundwork for building quantum network nodes with SnV-117 devices.</description>

Abstract: Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are generally not current-conserving. We introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of quasi-1D JJs with current conservation, with phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads matching the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard methods and calculate the current-phase relationship (CPR) for superconductor--normal metal--superconductor JJs with different gate voltages applied to the normal metal. We show that our approach can weaken or even reverse forward skewedness of the CPR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is the leading tool for studying the symmetry and structure of the order parameter in superconductors. The recent improvement of the technique made it possible to detect the superconducting energy gap at the surface of topological t-PtBi2 via observation of the record-breaking narrow line shapes. The promising new physics uncovered requires further investigation of the spectral and gap functions of t-PtBi2, but the challenging experimental conditions severely limit the application of conventional ARPES setups. In this work, we use synchrotron-based measurements and show that the gap at the surface Fermi arc in t-PtBi2 can be detected even with more relaxed experimental conditions than in our previous laser-based studies. At the same time, using simple model of ARPES spectra, we identify the minimum requirements to detect the gap and consider cases where the gap cannot be resolved.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronic properties and performance optimization for photovoltaic applications of R3m-RbGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites: A combined DFT and SCAPS-1D study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of an all-inorganic non-toxic perovskite solar cell (PSC) with enhanced performance, we have investigated the rhombohedral phase of the germanium-based rubidium halide perovskites RbGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I). The structural analysis followed by an in-depth study of the electronic and optical properties of these materials is performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). A detailed investigation of the electronic properties is carried out by examining the band structure and partial density of states (PDOS). PBE and TB-mBJ exchange-correlation functionals are used with and without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), thereby obtaining accurate predictions of the band gaps. The key optical properties such as the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, absorption coefficient and refractive index are studied using PBE functional and compared among the three halides. RbGeI$_3$ exhibits the lowest band gap of 0.96 eV with the TB-mBJ + SOC functional, along with the most favorable optical properties, hence, it was identified as the most suitable candidate for the absorber layer (AL) of the PSC. SCAPS-1D simulation is performed using various input parameters for the AL such as the band gap, the effective densities of states for the conduction and valence bands and the electron and hole mobilities extracted from the DFT calculation. Performance optimization is done by exploring the impact of different inorganic hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs). The impact of different layer thicknesses, doping densities, defect densities at the AL, ETL/AL, and AL/HTL interfaces, various back contacts, and the influence of series and shunt resistance on the overall device performance are studied. The optimized all-inorganic device demonstrated a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of $25.76\%$ with a fill factor (FF) of $79.81\%$.</description>

      <title>A unified bonding entropy model to determine magnetic properties in graphene nanoflakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) exhibit rich magnetic behaviors arising from two primary mechanisms: geometry frustration in non-Kekul\'e structures and electron delocalization-driven aromatic stabilization in Kekul\'e-type systems. Herein, we develop a unified bonding entropy model (BEM) to quantitatively characterize the magnetic properties in GNFs within a statistical framework, providing an entropy-based criterion for understanding and predicting bond occupancy numbers and unpaired electron distributions. While non-Kekul\'e systems naturally favor high-spin configurations due to topological frustration, the BEM reveals that even Kekul\'e-type GNFs can exhibit magnetic character when the entropy gain from unpaired electrons outweighs the loss of aromatic stabilization. The model predictions show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations in terms of spin density distributions and unpaired electron counts. Our results establish bonding entropy as a general guiding principle for designing carbon-based magentic materials with tunable magnetic properties.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spin states obtained by extracting $n$ electrons from closed-shell fermionic states. A partition of the system is defined through the introduction of the extraction modes. We derive the expression of the $n$-body reduced density matrices, which represent the extracted spin states. We show that these states exhibit different forms of spin entanglement, whose detection is discussed in terms of the spin squeezing inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological properties of triplon excitations in spin-1/2 dimer-singlet ground states defined on the maple leaf and star lattices. Our analysis is based on a model that includes Heisenberg interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, and an external magnetic field. In the absence of an in-plane DM vector, we demonstrate that the triplon Hamiltonian maps onto the magnon Hamiltonian of the Kagome lattice, inheriting its nontrivial topological characteristics, including Berry curvature and topological invariants such as the Z2 invariant and Chern numbers. This correspondence enables us to derive analytical expressions for the spin Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities at low temperatures. Furthermore, we explore the effects of realistic finite in-plane DM interactions, uncovering multiple topological transitions and a complex thermal Hall conductivity behavior, including potential sign reversals as functions of magnetic field and temperature. Using layer groups, we also provide a symmetry classification of the star and maple leaf lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing, and its controlled generation and detection remain key challenges in scalable quantum architectures. Here, we numerically demonstrate the deterministic generation of entangled spin states in a solid-state platform by implementing quantum gates via electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). Using two titanium atoms on a MgO/Ag(100) substrate as a model, we construct a two-qubit system whose dynamics are coherently manipulated through tailored microwave pulse sequences. We generate Bell states by implementing a Hadamard gate followed by a controlled-NOT gate, and evaluate its fidelity and concurrence using the quantum-master equation-based code TimeESR. Our results demonstrate that ESR-STM can create entangled states with significant fidelity. This study paves the way for the realization of atom-based quantum circuits and highlights ESR-STM as a powerful tool for probing and engineering entangled states on surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09488v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Scale-Free Phase-Field Studies of $\alpha$ to $\omega$ Phase Transformation in Single Crystal Zirconium under Nonhydrostatic Loadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zirconium (Zr) is an important engineering material with numerous practical applications. It undergoes martensitic $\alpha$ to $\omega$ phase transformation (PT) at pressures that vary from 0.67 GPa to 17 GPa under different loading conditions. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, the effect of the nonhydrostatic stresses is not well understood. To separate the effect of nonhydrostatic stresses from the plastic deformation, a scale-free phase field approach (PFA) for multivariant $\alpha$ to $\omega$ PT in a single crystal Zr under general nonhydrostatic loadings is presented. Explicit conditions for the direct and reverse PTs between austenite and martensitic variants and between martensitic variants under general stress tensor are derived and analyzed. In particular, the effect of the deviatoric stresses on the PT pressures is elucidated. It is shown that their effect cannot explain much larger reduction in the transformation pressure observed during plastic flow, i.e., specific mechanisms of strain-induced phase transformations should be involved. Under assumption of the homogeneous fields in the sample, complete analytical solutions that include stress-strain curves during the PT, PT start and finish stresses (i.e., stress hysteresis), and volume fraction of the variants, are determined for different loadings. Finite element method (FEM) solutions are found for the phase field simulations of the microstructure evolution for the same loadings, as well as for two grains of the polycrystalline sample. Macroscopic averaged characteristics of the PFA solutions are well described by an analytical solution, which also simplifies their interpretations. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with existing experiments. In addition, some controversies of the previous approaches are analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the widely used plasma analogy is unreliable at predicting edge properties of quantum Hall states. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between quantum Hall droplets and plasmas (Coulomb gases): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. Consequently, the plasma analogy fails at the edge, except in fine-tuned geometries, as it does not account for the emergent local edge velocity. We quantitatively show how the analogy's failure affects physical quantities, such as fluctuations of local observables and absorption rates in microwave spectroscopy, measurable in both solid-state experiments and quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Switchable Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Bogoliubov Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctuations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian linear perturbation to a Hamiltonian with a constant electromagnetic field and Hall conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stationary Schr\"odinger equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field with a non-Hermitian linear perturbation is studied. The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>On the non-hermitian Kitaev chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-hermitian Kitaev chain model, for arbitrary complex parameters. In particular, we give a concise characterisation of the curves of eigenvalues in the complex plane in the infinite size limit, using a novel method which can be applied to other non-hermitian systems. Using this solution, we characterise under which conditions the skin effect is absent, and for which eigenstates this is the case. We also fully determine the region in parameter space for which the model has a zero mode.</description>

      <title>Bending-strain effects in conventional superconductors and superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of bending-strain in thin films of clean, conventional superconductors (S), and the proximity-induced effect of this strain in SN bilayers with a normal metal (N), and SNS junctions with equal curvatures in each superconductor. We find that the effective spin-orbit coupling due to strain in the superconductor induces both spin-polarized and unequal-spin even-frequency p-wave triplet pairings throughout the superconductor. When interfaced with a normal metal, additional odd-frequency pairings are induced, and their magnitudes can be tuned with the strain. In SNS junctions, the strain alone can induce a superconducting spin current in the junction. The spin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\pi$-transition, resulting in an in-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the strain. We discuss the underlying physics and its implications for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</description>

      <title>Platforms for the realization and characterization of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.</description>
