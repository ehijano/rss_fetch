      <title>Geometric Linearization for Constraint Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the geometric linearization of constraint Hamiltonian systems using the Jacobi metric and the Eisenhart lift. We establish a connection between linearization and maximally symmetric spacetimes, focusing on the Noether symmetries admitted by the constraint Hamiltonian systems. Specifically, for systems derived from the singular Lagrangian $$ L\left( N,q^{k},\dot{q}^{k}\right) =\frac{1}{2N}g_{ij}\dot{q}^{i}\dot{q}^{j}-NV(q^{k}), $$ where $N$ and $q^{i}$ are dependent variables and $\dim g_{ij}=n$, the existence of $\frac{n\left( n+1\right) }{2}$ Noether symmetries is shown to be equivalent to the linearization of the equations of motion. The application of these results is demonstrated through various examples of special interest. This approach opens new directions in the study of differential equation linearization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the regularized integrals for decorated graphs on elliptic curves, which produces an almost holomorphic function on upper half plane. Then we give the graph version of holomorphic anomaly equation to study the anti-holomorphic dependence of the graph integral. Finally, we give a general method to compute the graph integral.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy Algorithms for the Binary Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary perceptron problem asks us to find a sign vector in the intersection of independently chosen random halfspaces with intercept $-\kappa$. We analyze the performance of the canonical discrepancy minimization algorithms of Lovett-Meka and Rothvoss/Eldan-Singh for the asymmetric binary perceptron problem. We obtain new algorithmic results in the $\kappa = 0$ case and in the large-$|\kappa|$ case. In the $\kappa\to-\infty$ case, we additionally characterize the storage capacity and complement our algorithmic results with an almost-matching overlap-gap lower bound.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Bosonic and Fermionic One-Form Symmetries in $2+1$d and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fundamental role that bosonic and fermionic symmetries play in physics, we study (non-invertible) one-form symmetries in $2 + 1$d consisting of topological lines with bosonic and fermionic self-statistics. We refer to these lines as Bose-Fermi-Braided (BFB) symmetries and argue that they can be classified. Unlike the case of generic anyonic lines, BFB symmetries are closely related to groups. In particular, when BFB lines are non-invertible, they are non-intrinsically non-invertible. Moreover, BFB symmetries are, in a categorical sense, weakly group theoretical. Using this understanding, we study invariants of renormalization group flows involving non-topological QFTs with BFB symmetry.</description>

      <title>Three cases of complex eigenvalue/vector distributions of symmetric order-three random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random tensor models have applications in a variety of fields, such as quantum gravity, quantum information theory, mathematics of modern technologies, etc., and studying their statistical properties, e.g., tensor eigenvalue/vector distributions, are interesting and useful. Recently some tensor eigenvalue/vector distributions have been computed by expressing them as partition functions of zero-dimensional quantum field theories. In this paper, using the method, we compute three cases of complex eigenvalue/vector distributions of symmetric order-three random tensors, where the three cases can be characterized by the Lie-group invariances, $O(N,\mathbb{R})$, $O(N,\mathbb{C})$, and $U(N,\mathbb{C})$, respectively. Exact closed-form expressions of the distributions are obtained by computing partition functions of four-fermi theories, where the last case is of the "signed" distribution which counts the distribution with a sign factor coming from a Hessian matrix. As an application, we compute the injective norm of the complex symmetric order-three random tensor in the large-$N$ limit by computing the edge of the last signed distribution, obtaining agreement with a former numerical result in the literature.</description>

      <title>Morse Theory and Meron Mediated Interactions Between Disclination Lines in Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological understanding of nematic liquid crystals is traditionally centered on singularities, or defects, and their classification via homotopy theory. However, this approach has ultimately proved insufficient to properly capture a range of complex behaviours that have been reported in three dimensions. To address this, we argue that a finer understanding of topology is required, in which non-singular but non-trivial topological solitons - so-called merons - play a central role in mediating interactions between disclination lines. We present a comprehensive framework for capturing such behaviour that draws heavily on aspects of Morse theory; the key notion being that merons appear singular under projection onto a two-dimensional surface. This permits the use of singularity theory and dividing curves to characterise nematic textures via tomography, as well as an understanding of topological transitions via surgery theory. We use our ideas to understand and classify complex three-dimensional behaviours, such as the linking, rewiring and crossing of disclination lines, as well as to provide a new perspective on defect charge.</description>

      <title>PSP-GEN: Stochastic inversion of the Process-Structure-Property chain in materials design through deep, generative probabilistic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse material design is a cornerstone challenge in materials science, with significant applications across many industries. Traditional approaches that invert the structure-property (SP) linkage to identify microstructures with targeted properties often overlook the feasibility of production processes, leading to microstructures that may not be manufacturable. Achieving both desired properties and a realizable manufacturing procedure necessitates inverting the entire Process-Structure-Property (PSP) chain. However, this task is fraught with challenges, including stochasticity along the whole modeling chain, the high dimensionality of microstructures and process parameters, and the inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem. This paper proposes a novel framework, named PSP-GEN, for the goal-oriented material design that effectively addresses these challenges by modeling the entire PSP chain with a deep generative model. It employs two sets of continuous, microstructure- and property-aware, latent variables, the first of which provides a lower-dimensional representation that captures the stochastic aspects of microstructure generation, while the second is a direct link to processing parameters. This structured, low-dimensional embedding not only simplifies the handling of high-dimensional microstructure data but also facilitates the application of gradient-based optimization techniques. The effectiveness and efficiency of this method are demonstrated in the inverse design of two-phase materials, where the objective is to design microstructures with target effective permeability. We compare state-of-the-art alternatives in challenging settings involving limited training data, target property regions for which no training data is available, and design tasks where the process parameters and microstructures have high-dimensional representations.</description>

      <title>Self-Excited Gravitational Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to constructing gravitational instantons based on the observation that the gravitational action of general relativity in its teleparallel formulation can be expressed as a product of torsion and excitation forms. We introduce a new class of solutions where these two forms are equal, which we term the self-excited instantons, and advocate for their use over the self-dual instantons of Eguchi and Hanson. These new self-excited instantons exhibit striking similarities to BPST instantons in Yang-Mills theory, as their action reduces to a topological Nieh-Yan term, which allows us to identify the axial torsion as a topological current and to define a topological charge.</description>

      <title>Regularity and temperature of stationary black hole event horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Available proofs of the regularity of stationary black hole event horizons rely on some assumptions on the existence of sections that imply a $C^1$ differentiability assumption. By using a quotient bundle approach, we remedy this problem by proving directly that, indeed, under the null energy condition event horizons of stationary black holes are totally geodesic null hypersurfaces as regular as the metric. Only later, by using this result, we show that the cross-sections, whose existence was postulated in previous works, do indeed exist. These results hold true under weak causality conditions. Subsequently, we prove that under the dominant energy condition stationary black hole event horizons indeed admit constant surface gravity, a result that does not require any non-degeneracy assumption, requirements on existence of cross-sections or a priori smoothness conditions. We are able to make sense of the angular velocity and of the value (not just sign) of surface gravity as quantities related to the horizon, without the need of assuming Einstein's vacuum equations and the Killing extension. Physically, the result means that under very general conditions every stationary black hole has indeed a constant temperature (the zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics).</description>

      <title>On the sub-adjacent Hopf algebra of the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the notion of post-Hopf algebra was introduced, with the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra as the fundamental example. A novel property is that any cocommutative post-Hopf algebra gives rise to a sub-adjacent Hopf algebra with a generalized Grossman-Larson product. By twisting the post-Hopf product, we provide a combinatorial antipode formula for the sub-adjacent Hopf algebra of the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra. Relating to such a sub-adjacent Hopf algebra, we also obtain a closed inverse formula for the Oudom-Guin isomorphism in the context of post-Lie algebras. Especially as a byproduct, we derive a cancellation-free antipode formula for the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra of ordered trees through a concrete tree-grafting expression.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Swanson oscillator forms a prototypical example of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and non-Hermitian system with a quadratic Hamiltonian. The system is described by the generic quadratic Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\rm Swanson} = \hbar \Omega_0 \big( \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2}\big) + \alpha \hat{a}^2 + \beta ({\hat{a}^\dagger})^2$, where $\Omega_0 &gt; 0$, $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\alpha \neq \beta$. We show that such a system may be realized as a harmonic oscillator in the presence of an imaginary-valued gauge field. In the position representation, we solve the problem exactly, i.e., we find the wavefunctions and the spectrum. We then also propose a similar non-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension of the isotonic oscillator which is exactly solved for a certain range of the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the class of Derezi{\'n}ski-Enss pair-potentials which includes Coulomb potentials a stationary scattering theory for $N$-body systems was recently developed \cite {Sk1}. In particular the wave and scattering matrices as well as the restricted wave operators are all defined at any non-threshold energy, and this holds without imposing any a priori decay condition on channel eigenstates. In this paper we improve for the case of $3$-body systems on the known \emph{weak continuity} properties in that we show that all non-threshold energies are \emph{stationary complete} in this case, resolving a conjecture from \cite {Sk1} in the special case $N=3$. A consequence is that the above scattering quantities depend \emph{strongly continuously} on the energy parameter at all non-threshold energies, hence not only almost everywhere as previously demonstrated (for an arbitrary $N$). Another consequence is that the  scattering matrix is unitary at any such energy. As a side result we give an independent stationary proof of asymptotic completeness for $3$-body systems with long-range pair-potentials. This is an alternative to the known time-dependent proofs \cite{De, En}.</description>

      <title>A subspace-adaptive weights cubature method with application to the local hyperreduction of parameterized finite element models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with quadrature/cubature rules able to deal with multiple subspaces of functions, in such a way that the integration points are common for all the subspaces, yet the weights are tailored to each specific subspace. These subspace-adaptive weights cubature rules can be used to accelerate computational mechanics applications requiring efficiently evaluating spatial integrals whose integrand function dynamically switches between multiple pre-computed subspaces. One of such applications is local hyperreduced-order modeling (HROM), in which the solution manifold is approximately represented as a collection of basis matrices, each basis matrix corresponding to a different region in parameter space. We pose the optimization problem and propose two algorithms for its resolution. The first one is a greedy strategy based on an enhanced version of the Empirical Cubature Method (ECM) developed by the authors elsewhere (we call it the Subspace-Adaptive Weights ECM, SAW-ECM for short), while the second method is based on a convexification of the cubature problem so that it can be addressed by linear programming algorithms. We show in a toy problem involving integration of polynomial functions that the SAW-ECM clearly outperforms the other method both in terms of computational cost and optimality. We illustrate the performance of the SAW-ECM in the construction of a local HROMs in a highly nonlinear equilibrium problem (large strains regime). We demonstrate that, provided that the subspace-transition errors are negligible, the error associated to hyperreduction using adaptive weights can be controlled by the truncation tolerances of the SVDs used for determining the basis matrices. The Python source codes of the proposed SAW-ECM are openly accessible in the public repository https://github.com/Rbravo555/localECM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work of 2014 on a quantum system governed by the repulsive Hamiltonian, the author proved uniqueness for short-range interactions described by a scattering operator consisting of regular and singular parts. In this paper, the singular part is assumed to have much stronger singularities and the same uniqueness theorem is proved. By applying the time-dependent method invented by Enss and Weder in 1995, the high-velocity limit for a wider class of the scattering operator with stronger singularities also uniquely determines the interactions of a multi-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Power laws and logarithmic oscillations in diffusion processes on infinite countable ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that if the initial condition of the Cauchy problem for the diffusion equation on a general infinite countable ultrametric space is spherically symmetric with respect to some point, then this problem has an exact analytical solution. A general solution of this problem is presented for pure ultrametric diffusion, as well as for ultrametric diffusion with a reaction sink concentrated at the center of spherical symmetry. Conditions on the ultrametric and the distribution of the number of states in ultrametric spheres are found that lead at large times to the asymptotic behavior of the solutions obtained in the form of a power law modulated by a bounded function that is log-periodic under some additional conditions.</description>

      <title>Clustering of higher order connected correlations in C$^*$ dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of $C^*$ dynamical systems, we consider a locally compact group $G$ acting by $^*$-automorphisms on a C$^*$ algebra $\mathfrak{U}$ of observables, and assume a state of $\mathfrak{U}$ that satisfies the clustering property with respect to a net of group elements of $G$. That is, the two-point connected correlation function vanishes in the limit on the net, when one observable is translated under the group action. Then we show that all higher order connected correlation functions (Ursell functions, or classical cumulants) and all free correlation functions (free cumulants, from free probability) vanish at the same rate in that limit. Additionally, we show that mean clustering, also called ergodicity, extends to higher order correlations. We then apply those results to equilibrium states of quantum spin lattice models. Under certain assumptions on the range of the interaction, high temperature Gibbs states are known to be exponentially clustering w.r.t. space translations. Combined with the Lieb-Robinson bound, one obtains exponential clustering for space-time translations outside the Lieb-Robinson light-cone. Therefore, by our present results, all the higher order connected and free correlation functions will vanish exponentially under space-time translations outside the Lieb-Robinson light cone, in high temperature Gibbs states. Another consequence is that their long-time averaging over a space-time ray vanishes for almost every ray velocity.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of integrable long-range spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  The limit $q\to1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. At finite size, only the latter is U(1)-symmetric.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry (HS) chains, as well as the Inozemtsev chain and its recent q-deformation. We find that the two landscapes only share a single point: the rational HS chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the anti-periodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

Abstract: We revisit Fourier's approach to solve the heat equation on the circle in the context of (twisted) reduced group C*-algebras, convergence of Fourier series and semigroups associated to negative definite functions. We introduce some heat properties for countably infinite groups and investigate when they are satisfied. Kazhdan's property (T) is an obstruction to the weakest property, and our findings leave open the possibility that this might be the only one. On the other hand, many groups with the Haagerup property satisfy the strongest version. We show that this heat property implies that the associated heat problem has a unique solution regardless of the choice of the initial datum.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic fluctuations of linear eigenvalue statistics of random centrosymmetric matrices with i.i.d. entries. We prove that for a complex analytic test function, the centered and normalized linear eigenvalue statistics of random centrosymmetric matrices converge to a normal distribution. We find the exact expression of the variance of the limiting normal distribution via combinatorial arguments. Moreover, we also argue that the limiting spectral distribution of properly scaled centrosymmetric matrices follows the circular law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider semiclassically scaled, weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with external confining potentials and additional angular-momentum rotation term. This type of model arises in the Gross-Pitaevskii theory of trapped, rotating quantum gases. We construct asymptotic solutions in the form of semiclassical wave-packets, which are concentrated in both space and in frequency around an classical Hamiltonian phase-space flow. The rotation term is thereby seen to alter this flow, but not the corresponding classical action.</description>

      <title>Axialgravisolitons at infinite corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational solitons (gravisolitons) are particular exact solutions of Einstein field equation in vacuum build on a given background solution. Their interpretation is not yet fully clear but they contain many of the physically relevant solutions low $N$-solitons solutions. However, a systematic study and characterization of gravisolitons solution for every $N$ is lacking and their relevance in a theory of quantum gravity is not fully understood. This work aims to investigate and characterize some properties of $N$-axialsoliton solutions such as their asymptotically behaviour and asymptotic symmetries given minimal assumptions on the background metric. We develop an explicit systematic asymptotically expansion for the $N$-axialsoliton solution and we compute the leading order of the asymptotic killing vectors. Moreover, in the perspective to better understand the role of gravisolitons in quantum gravity we make a link, and a one of the first explicit test, to the corner symmetry proposal deriving which subalgebra of the universal corner symmetry algebra is generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors of $N$-axialsoliton solution. In the spirit of the corner proposal, the axialgravisoliton corner symmetry algebra (\textfrak{agcsa}) can be useful for the quantization of the non-asymptotically flat sector of gravity while, in the spirit of IR triangle, new soft theorems and memory effects could emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heat equation, based on Fourier's law, is commonly used for description of heat conduction. However, Fourier's law is valid under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is violated in very small dimensions and short timescales, and at low temperatures. In the paper R. Kovacs and P. Van, Generalized heat conduction in heat pulse experiments, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 83:613-620, 2015, a ballistic-conductive (BC) model of heat conduction was developed. In this paper, we study the behavior of solutions to an initial value problem (IVP) in 1D in the framework of the linearized ballistic-conductive (BC) model. As a result of the study, an unphysical effect has been found when part of the initial thermal energy does not spread anywhere.</description>

      <title>Critical Fermions are Universal Embezzlers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal embezzlers are bipartite quantum systems from which any entangled state may be extracted to arbitrary precision using local operations while perturbing the state of the system arbitrarily little. Here, we show that universal embezzlers are ubiquitous in many-body physics: The ground state sector of every local, translation-invariant, and critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice is a universal embezzler if bi-partitioned into two half-chains. The same property holds in locally-interacting, dual spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Universal embezzlement manifests already for finite system sizes, not only in the thermodynamic limit: For any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. On a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground state sectors of the given models are type III$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>A Sufficient Criterion for Divisibility of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel $\Phi$ is divisible, i.e. that there exists a non-trivial factorization $\Phi=\Phi_1\Phi_2$. The idea is to first define an "elementary" channel $\Phi_2$ and then to analyze when $\Phi\Phi_2^{-1}$ is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way -- which even yields an explicit factorization of $\Phi$ -- is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors $x,x^\perp$ such that $\langle x^\perp|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\langle x|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\{0\}$ where $\mathcal K_\Phi$ is the Kraus subspace of $\Phi$ and $\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp$ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application -- if possible -- results in a factorization of $\Phi$ into in some sense "simple" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.</description>

Abstract: The Fibonacci topological order is the prime candidate for the realization of universal topological quantum computation. We devise minimal quantum circuits to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, as realized in the Levin-Wen string net model. Our circuits effectively initialize the ground state, create excitations, twist and braid them, all in the smallest lattices possible. We further design methods to determine the fusion amplitudes and braiding phases of multiple excitations by carrying out a single qubit measurement. We show that the fusion channels of the doubled Fibonacci model can be detected using only three qubits, twisting phases can be measured using five, and braiding can be demonstrated using nine qubits. These designs provide the simplest possible settings for demonstrating the properties of Fibonacci anyons and can be used as realistic blueprints for implementation on many modern quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic windings, surface helicity and their applications in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, J. Parsley, J. Geom. Phys. 60:1127 (2010)] Cantarella and Parsley introduced the notion of submanifold helicity. In the present paper we investigate properties of surface helicity and in particular answer two open questions posed in the aforementioned work: (i) We give a precise mathematically rigorous physical interpretation of surface helicity in terms of linking of distinct field lines. (ii) We prove that surface helicity is non-trivial if and only if the underlying surface has non-trivial topology (i.e. at least one hole).
  We then focus on toroidal surfaces which are of relevance in plasma physics and express surface helicity in terms of average poloidal and toroidal windings of the individual field lines of the underlying vector field which enables us to provide a connection between surface helicity and rotational transform. Further, we show how some of our results may be utilised in the context of coil designs for plasma fusion confinement devices in order to obtain coil configurations of particular "simple" shape.
  Lastly, we consider the problem of optimising surface helicity among toroidal surfaces of fixed area and show that toroidal surfaces admitting a symmetry constitute global minimisers.</description>
