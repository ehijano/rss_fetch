      <title>Breaking the wire: the impact of critical length on melting pathways in silver nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the melting mechanisms of silver nanowires through molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical modelling, where we observe that two distinct mechanisms or pathways emerge that dictate how the solid-liquid interface melts during the phase transition. For wires longer than a critical length ($L&gt;L_{\textrm{crit}}$), an Arrhenius-type diffusion model successfully predicts the solid-liquid interface velocity, highlighting diffusion-driven melting pathways. In contrast, wires shorter than the critical length ($L\leq L_{\textrm{crit}}$) exhibit unique behaviours driven by non-equilibrium effects, including rapid overheating of the solid core, stabilization of the solid-liquid interface, and the pronounced impact of higher energy densities. These mechanisms lead to accelerated melting and distinct phase transition dynamics. Our findings reveal how geometry and nanoscale effects critically shape melting behaviour, offering insights for the design and stability of nanostructures in advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-thermodynamic phase transition in strained phosphorous-doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore quantum-thermodynamic effects in a phosphorous (P)-doped graphene monolayer subjected to biaxial tensile strain. Introducing substitutional P atoms in the graphene lattice generates a tunable spin magnetic moment controlled by the strain control parameter $\varepsilon$. This leads to a magnetic quantum phase transition (MQPT) at zero temperature modulated by $\varepsilon$. The system transitions from a magnetic phase, characterized by an out-of-plane $sp^3$ type hybridization of the P-carbon (P-C) bonds, to a non-magnetic phase when these bonds switch to in-plane $sp^2$ hybridization. Employing a Fermi-Dirac statistical model, we calculate key thermodynamic quantities as the electronic entropy $S_e$ and electronic specific heat $C_e$. At finite temperatures, we find the MQPT is reflected in both $S_e$ and $C_e$, which display a distinctive $\Lambda$-shaped profile as a function of $\varepsilon$. These thermodynamic quantities sharply increase up to $\varepsilon = 5\% $ in the magnetic regime, followed by a sudden drop at $\varepsilon = 5.5\% $, transitioning to a linear dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the nonmagnetic regime. Notably, $S_e$ and $C_e$ capture the MQPT behavior for low and moderate temperature ranges, providing insights into the accessible electronic states in P-doped graphene. This controllable magnetic-to-nonmagnetic switch offers potential applications in electronic nanodevices operating at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Two-terminal transport in biased lattices: transition from ballistic to diffusive current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze quantum transport of charged fermionic particles in the tight-binding lattice connecting two particle reservoirs (the leads). If the lead chemical potentials are different they create an electric field which tilts the lattice. We study the effect of this tilt on quantum transport in the presence of weak relaxation/decoherence processes in the lattice. It is shown that the Landauer ballistic transport regime for a weak tilt (small chemical potential difference) changes to the diffusive Esaki-Tsu transport regime for a strong tilt (large chemical potential difference), where the critical tilt for this crossover is determined by the condition that the Wannier-Stark localization length coincides with the lattice length.</description>

      <title>RC circuit based on magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are nano-sized magnetic whirls attractive for spintronic applications due to their innate stability. They can emulate the characteristic behavior of various spintronic and electronic devices such as spin-torque nano-oscillators, artificial neurons and synapses, logic devices, diodes, and ratchets. Here, we show that skyrmions can emulate the physics of an RC circuit, the fundamental electric circuit composed of a resistor and a capacitor, on the nanosecond time scale. The equation of motion of a current-driven skyrmion in a quadratic energy landscape is mathematically equivalent to the differential equation characterizing an RC circuit: the applied current resembles the applied input voltage, and the skyrmion position resembles the output voltage at the capacitor. These predictions are confirmed via micromagnetic simulations. We show that such a skyrmion system reproduces the characteristic exponential voltage decay upon charging and discharging the capacitor under constant input. Furthermore, it mimics the low-pass filter behavior of RC circuits by filtering high-frequencies in periodic input signals. Since RC circuits are mathematically equivalent to the Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) model widely used to describe biological neurons, our device concept can also be regarded as a perfect artificial LIF neuron.</description>

      <title>Orbital Description of Landau Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a minimal lattice model to provide an orbital description of lowest and first Landau levels. With the maximally localized Wannier functions with $s$, $p_-$, $p_+$ orbital characteristics, a three-orbital model is developed, where the lowest two Chern bands are flat with $\mathcal{C}=1$. This model can be viewed as consecutive band inversions between these Wannier states at $\Gamma$ and $K$ in momentum space, which adiabatically connects the atomic insulator limit to Landau level physics. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that the Abelian states can appear in the 1/3-filled lowest Chern band, while the signatures of the non-Abelian states are found in the half-filled first Chern band. This construction can be further extended to realize flat Chern bands resembling the higher Landau levels. Our results offer a new perspective to understand the lattice analogue of Landau levels, potentially enabling the realization of the fascinating topological phenomena at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary magnetoresistance in high-quality graphene devices with daisy chains and Fermi-level pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied daisy-chained extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) devices based on high quality monolayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) at room temperature. The largest magnetoresistance (MR) achieved in our devices is 4.6 x 10^7 %, the record for EMR devices to date. The magnetic field sensitivity, dR/dB, reaches 104 kohm/T, exceeding the previous record set by encapsulated graphene by more than 300 %, and is comparable with state-of-the-art graphene Hall sensors at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K). We demonstrate that daisy chaining multiple EMR devices is a new way to reach arbitrarily high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, and extremely small noise equivalent field for weak magnetic field detection. Finally, we show the evidence of metal contact-induced Fermi-level pinning in the sample and its influence on graphene properties, current distribution and EMR performance. We highlight the EMR geometry as an interesting alternative to the Hall geometry for fundamental physics studies.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Spin-phase transition in an array of quantum rings controlled by cavity photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model a spin-phase transition in a two-dimensional square array, or a lateral superlattice, of quantum rings in an external perpendicular homogeneous magnetic field. The electron system is placed in a circular cylindrical far-infrared photon cavity with a single circularly symmetric photon mode. Our numerical results reveal that the spin ordering of the two-dimensional electron gas in each quantum ring can be influenced or controlled by the electron-photon coupling strength and the energy of the photons. The Coulomb interaction between the electrons is described by a spin-density functional approach, but the para- and the diamagnetic electron-photon interactions are modeled via a configuration interaction formalism in a truncated many-body Fock-space, which is updated in each iteration step of the density functional approach. In the absence of external electromagnetic pulses this spin-phase transition is replicated in the orbital magnetization of the rings. The spin-phase transition can be suppressed by a strong electron-photon interaction. In addition, fluctuations in the spin configuration are found in dynamical calculations, where the system is excited by a time-dependent scheme specially fit for emphasizing the diamagnetic electron-photon interaction.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in quantum tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on experimental data, we propose a model to evaluate the energy dissipated during quantum tunneling processes in solid-state junctions. This model incorporates a nonlinear friction force expressed in the general form f(x)={\gamma} v(x)^{\alpha}, where {\gamma} is the frictional coefficient, which is fitted to data. We study this by applying voltages just below the barrier height up to near break down voltages. Furthermore, by lowering the temperature and adjusting the applied voltage to the junction, the effect on dissipation caused by the variation in barrier height is examined. We underline that the crucial dependency of dissipation on the fraction of particle energy lost is modulated by two primary mechanisms: the application of voltage and the variation of temperature. The fraction of energy dissipated decreases in general for increasing energies of the tunneling particles at a given temperature. However, for a given energy of the tunneling particle, the present work demonstrates a turning point at a temperature of 137 K, after which the dissipated energy starts increasing for higher temperatures. The latter can possibly be due to the increase of electron-phonon interactions which become predominant over barrier height reduction at higher temperatures and hence we identify T = 137 K as a critical temperature for change in dissipative characteristics of the solid-state junction under consideration. Notably, also the study identifies significant changes in dissipation parameters, {\gamma} and {\alpha}, above 137 K, exhibiting a linear decline and underscoring the importance of further research at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Micromagnetic Theory of Magnons in Finite Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum field theoretical formalism for studying magnons in finite nanostructures with arbitrary shapes and spatially nonuniform ground states. It extends the classical micromagnetic formalism by introducing a micromagnetic Hamiltonian quantum operator, which incorporates exchange, Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya, anisotropy, magnetostatic, and Zeeman energies. The nonuniformity of the ground state is handled by pointwise aligning the quantization axis of the magnetization field operator with the classical ground state. The Hamiltonian is expanded in the large spin-number limit and truncated to retain only terms quadratic in the components of the magnetization operator transverse to the quantization axis. This quadratic Hamiltonian is used to derive the linear quantum Landau-Lifshitz equation. By diagonalizing this equation under appropriate boundary and normalization conditions, a discrete set of magnon creation and annihilation operators is obtained, enabling a complete description of the magnon spectrum. Finally, the theory is applied to study the effects of temperature and shape on low-temperature thermal equilibrium fluctuations of magnons in thin ferromagnetic nanodisks.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Lorentz symmetric systems: a quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the hydrodynamic behavior of charge current in a Lorentz symmetric system: graphene at charge-neutrality. The momentum flow is completely decoupled from the charge current in this regime, since the electrons and holes propagate in opposite directions with exactly equal distribution functions. Instead of Navier-Stokes equations for the velocity field, we derive similar equations directly for the charge current. This eliminates the need for any coupling between the velocity field and charge current to explain the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. In this framework, the current diffusion coefficient replaces viscosity. To support this, we performed an extensive quantum Monte Carlo study, directly simulating samples with disordered edges using the underlying microscopic interacting quantum Hamiltonian. For the first time, we observe hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current in such simulations, extracting current profiles and a current diffusion coefficient whose temperature dependence qualitatively agrees with predictions from Boltzmann transport theory.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Spin and Orbital Pumping in Metallic Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin and orbital densities induced by magnetization dynamics in a planar bilayer heterostructure. To do this, we employed a theory of adiabatic pumping using the Keldysh formalism and Wigner expansion. We first conduct simulations on a model system to determine the parameters that control the spin and orbital pumping into an adjacent non-magnetic metal. We conclude that, in principle, the orbital pumping can be as significant as spin pumping when the spin-orbit coupling is present in the ferromagnet. We extend the study to realistic heterostructures involving heavy metals (W, Pt, Au) and light metals (Ti, Cu) by using first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that orbital pumping is favored in metals with $d$ states close to the Fermi level, such as Ti, Pt, and W, but is quenched in materials lacking such states, such as Cu and Au. Orbital injection is also favored in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, leading to large orbital pumping in Ni/(Pt, W) bilayers.</description>

      <title>Shear-resistant topology in quasi one-dimensional van der Waals material Bi$_4$Br$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi$_4$Br$_4$ is a prototypical quasi one-dimensional (1D) material in which covalently bonded bismuth bromide chains are arranged in parallel, side-by-side and layer-by-layer, with van der Waals (vdW) gaps in between. So far, two different structures have been reported for this compound, $\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ and $\beta$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ , in both of which neighboring chains are shifted by $\mathbf{b}/2$, i.e., half a unit cell vector in the plane, but which differ in their vertical stacking. While the different layer arrangements are known to result in distinct electronic properties, the effect of possible in-plane shifts between the atomic chains remains an open question. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report a new Bi$_4$Br$_4$(001) structure, with a shift of $\mathbf{b}/3$ between neighboring chains in the plane and AB layer stacking. We determine shear strain to be the origin of this new structure, which can readily result in shifts of neighboring atomic chains because of the weak inter-chain bonding. For the observed $b/3$ structure, the (residual) atomic chain shift corresponds to an in-plane shear strain of $\gamma\approx7.5\%$. STS reveals a bulk insulating gap and metallic edge states at surface steps, indicating that the new structure is also a higher-order topological insulator, just like $\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$, in agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <title>Current noise in quantum dot thermoelectric engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a thermoelectric heat engine based on a single-level quantum dot, calculating average quantities such as current, heat current, output power, and efficiency, as well as fluctuations (noise). Our theory is based on a diagrammatic expansion of the memory kernel together with counting statistics, and we investigate the effects of strong interactions and next-to-leading order tunneling. Accounting for next-to-leading order tunneling is crucial for a correct description when operating at high power and high efficiency, and in particular affect the qualitative behavior of the Fano factor and efficiency. We compare our results with the so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relations, which provide a lower bound on the fluctuations for a given efficiency. In principle, the conventional thermodynamic uncertainty relations can be violated by the non-Markovian quantum effects originating from next-to-leading order tunneling, providing a type of quantum advantage. However, for the specific heat engine realization we consider here, we find that next-to-leading order tunneling does not lead to such violations, but in fact always pushes the results further away from the bound set by the thermodynamic uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber-dependent magnetic losses in YIG-GGG heterostructures at millikelvin temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons have inspired potential applications in modern quantum technologies and hybrid quantum systems due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, nanoscale scalability, and a unique set of experimentally accessible parameters for manipulating their dispersion. Such magnon-based quantum technologies demand long decoherence times, millikelvin temperatures, and minimal dissipation. Due to its low magnetic damping, the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG), grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), is the most promising material for this objective. To comprehend the magnetic losses of propagating magnons in such YIG-GGG heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures, we investigate magnon transport in a micrometer-thick YIG sample via propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (PSWS) measurements for temperatures between 4K to 26mK. We demonstrate an increase in the dissipation rate with wavenumber at cryogenic temperatures, caused by dipolar coupling to the partially magnetized GGG substrate. Additionally, we observe a temperature-dependent decrease in spin-wave transmission, attributed to rare earth ion relaxations. The critical role of the additional dissipation channels at cryogenic temperatures is underpinned by the comparison of the experimental results with theoretical calculations and micromagnetic simulations. Our findings strengthen the understanding of magnon losses at millikelvin temperatures, which is essential for the future detection of individual propagating magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical model for electronic transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) artificial atom in a graphene monolayer. The artificial atom is due to the presence of a charged adatom (Coulomb impurity) in the layer and interacts with a fast ultrarelativistic ion moving parallel to the layer. We compute the probability and cross sections for the corresponding electronic transitions by means of an exact solution of the time-dependent 2D Dirac equation describing the interaction of the planar atom with the electromagnetic field of the ultrarelativistic projectile.</description>

      <title>Evidence of anisotropic three-dimensional weak-localization in TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TiSe$_2$ is a typical transition-metal dichalcogenide known for its charge-density wave order. In this study, we report the observation of an unusual anisotropic negative magnetoresistance in exfoliated TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes at low temperatures. Unlike the negative magnetoresistance reported in most other transition-metal dichalcogenides, our results cannot be explained by either the conventional two-dimensional weak localization effect or the Kondo effect. A comprehensive analysis of the data suggests that the observed anisotropic negative magnetoresistance in TiSe$_2$ flakes is most likely caused by the three-dimensional weak localization effect. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the phase-coherent transport processes in TiSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Electronic Structure at the Boundary of Topological Insulators in the $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ Family by Combined STM and AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical scheme for the calculation of tunneling current $I$ and differential conductance $\mathsf{d}I/\mathsf{d}V$ of metal and CO-terminated STM tips on the topological insulators $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$, $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Te}_2\mathrm{Se}$ and $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Te}_3$ and find excellent agreement with experiment. The calculation is an application of Chen's derivative rule, whereby the Bloch functions are obtained from Wannier interpolated tight-binding Hamiltonians and maximally localized Wannier functions from first-principle DFT+$GW$ calculations. We observe signatures of the topological boundary modes, their hybridization with bulk bands, Van Hove singularities of the bulk bands and characterize the orbital character of these electronic modes using the high spatial resolution of STM and AFM. Bare DFT calculations are insufficient to explain the experimental data, which are instead accurately reproduced by many-body corrected $GW$ calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory circuit for ion channel dynamics in the nervous system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opening or closing mechanism of a voltage-gated ion channel is triggered by the potential difference crossing the cell membrane in the nervous system. Based on this picture, we model the ion channel as a nanoscale two-terminal ionic tunneling junction. External time-varying voltage exerting on the two-terminal ionic tunneling junction mimics the stimulation of neurons from the outside. By deriving the quantum Langevin equation from quantum mechanics, the ion channel current is obtained by the quantum tunneling of ions controlled by the time-varying voltage. The time-varying voltage induces an effective magnetic flux which causes quantum coherence in ion tunnelings and leads to sideband effects in the ion channel current dynamics. The sideband effects in the ionic current dynamics manifest a multi-crossing hysteresis in the I-V curve, which is the memory dynamics responding to the variation of the external voltage. Such memory dynamics is defined as the active quantum memory with respect to the time-varying stimuli. We can quantitatively describe how active quantum memory is generated and changed. We find that the number of the non-zero cross points in the I-V curve hysteresis and the oscillation of the differential conductance are the characteristics for quantitatively describing the active quantum memory. We also explore the temperature dependence of the active quantum memory in such a system. The discovery of this active quantum memory characteristics provides a new understanding about the underlying mechanism of ion channel dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed readout of ultrasensitive bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, ultrasensitive calorimeters have been proposed as a resource-efficient solution for multiplexed qubit readout in superconducting large-scale quantum processors. However, experiments demonstrating frequency multiplexing of these superconductor-normal conductor-superconductor (SNS) sensors are coarse. To this end, we present the design, fabrication, and operation of three SNS sensors with frequency-multiplexed input and probe circuits, all on a single chip. These devices have their probe frequencies in the range \SI{150}{\mega\hertz} -- \SI{200}{\mega\hertz}, which is well detuned from the heater frequencies of \SI{4.4}{\giga\hertz} -- \SI{7.6}{\giga\hertz} compatible with typical readout frequencies of superconducting qubits. Importantly, we show on-demand triggering of both individual and multiple low-noise SNS bolometers with very low cross talk. These experiments pave the way for multiplexed bolometric characterization and calorimetric readout of multiple qubits, a promising step in minimizing related resources such as the number of readout lines and microwave isolators in large-scale superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Third-order Orbital Corner State and its Realization in Acoustic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three dimensional (3D) third-order topological insulators (TIs) have zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which are three dimensions lower than bulk. Here we investigate the third-order TIs on breathing pyrochlore lattices with p-orbital freedom. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is derived for the p-orbital model, in which we find that the two orthogonal ${\pi}$-type (transverse) hoppings are the key to open a band gap and obtain higher-order topological corner states. We introduce the Z4 berry phase to characterize the bulk topology and analysis the phase diagram. The corner states, demonstrated in a finite structure of a regular tetrahedron, exhibit rich 3D orbital configurations. Furthermore, we design an acoustic system to introduce the necessary ${\pi}$-type hopping and successfully observe the orbital corner states. Our work extends topological orbital corner states to third-order, which enriches the contents of orbital physics and may lead to applications in novel topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent ferroicity of reversed bilayer: altermagnetism or ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a new branch of magnetism independent of traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has attracted extensive attention recently. At present, researchers have proved several kinds of three-dimensional altermagnets, but research on two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets remains elusive. Here, we propose a method for designing altermagnetism in 2D lattices: bilayer reversed stacking. This method could enable altermagnetism-type spin splitting to occur intrinsically and the spin-splitting can be controlled by crystal chirality. We also demonstrate it through a real material of bilayer PtBr$_3$ with AB' stacking order. Additionally, the combination of stacking order and slidetronics offers new opportunities for electrical writing and magnetic reading of electronic devices. In the case of AC' stacking, interlayer sliding results in reversible spontaneous polarization. This unique combination of antiferromagnetism and sliding ferroelectricity leads to polarization-controlled spin-splitting, thus enabling magnetoelectric coupling, which can be detected by magneto-optical Kerr effect even without net magnetization. Our research highlights that reversed stacking provides a platform to explore rich physical properties of magnetism, ferroelectricity, and spin-splitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optical diffraction, the phase difference between sources in a grating or multi-slit mask is determined by the angle to the imaging screen, yielding the familiar multi-lobed diffraction image. Here, we realize a similar phenomenon in a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid circuit configured to allow Andreev scattering from multiple parallel scatterers. Phase differences between scatterers are set by tapping off of a remote superconducting meander. We investigate arrays with two, three, four, and ten Andreev scatterers, examining local and nonlocal diffraction patterns, finding good agreement with a theory of multiple Andreev scattering. Adding current-carrying taps to the meander allows individual phase control.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Pseudospin Injection Beyond Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible to conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical pseudospin injection} (OPI) beyond ordinary Weyl semimetals (WSMs), specifically in multi-WSMs (mWSMs) and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OPI in mWSMs is independent of the frequency of the light and linearly proportional to the quantized topological charge as a consequence of the inherent band linearity in their dispersions. Interestingly, while the response does not depend on the tilting of a type-I node, it is a decreasing function of the same in type-II mWSMs. We also reveal that the frequency-independence can be destroyed either by going beyond a certain cutoff frequency under lattice regularization or by going to a higher-order Weyl phase. The predicted signatures of OPI beyond the ordinary WSM could be experimentally exploited, leading to effective access as well as distinguishing between different nontrivial Weyl topologies.</description>

      <title>Giant Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Magnetic Monolayers CrPX3 (X = S, Se, Te) due to symmetry breaking between the in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic axes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) has a crucial feature for developing highly sensitive sensors and innovative memory devices. While extensively studied in bulk materials, AMR effects in these materials are typically weak. Recent advancements indicate that two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnetic materials possess unique magnetic properties, potentially including significant AMR characteristics. In this study, we utilize density functional theory and the Boltzmann transport equation to investigate AMR in magnetic monolayers CrPX3 (X = S, Se, Te). Our findings reveal a substantially large AMR in these 2D magnetic compounds. This enhancement is attributed to magnetization (M)-dependent spin-orbit coupling (SOC), arising from the broken symmetry between in-plane and out-of-plane orientations. This results in significant M-dependent band splitting and subsequent variations in electron velocity. Additionally, we find that the M-dependent SOC is significantly enhanced by increasing the atomic number of the chalcogen X in CrPX3, achieving an exceptional 150% AMR in CrPTe3. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that AMR can be effectively modulated by applying biaxial strain, resulting in a twofold increase with a 4% strain. These findings propose a novel approach to enhancing 2D-based AMR spintronic devices, making a substantial contribution to the field.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electric Polarization via Exchange Striction Interaction in CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ by Sr-Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate contributions to the TSDC density from both extrinsic thermally stimulated depolarization processes and intrinsic pyroelectric current arising from magnetically induced polarization changes. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.</description>
