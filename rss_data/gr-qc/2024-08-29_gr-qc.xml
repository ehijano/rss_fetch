      <title>Spin the black circle: horizon absorption on non-circular, planar binary black hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems of black holes emit gravitational waves as they move through their orbits. While most of the emitted radiation escapes to future null infinity, a small fraction is absorbed by the black holes themselves. This is known as horizon absorption or tidal heating/torquing, and causes the black holes' masses and spins to change as the system evolves. In this work, we quantify the effects of the horizon flux on binary black holes dynamics by computing them up to next-to-next-to-leading order on generic planar orbits, also exploring physically motivated factorizations of the results. We integrate these fluxes over unbound, hyperbolic-like trajectories obtained with the Effective-One-Body model TEOBResumS. We discuss the resulting phenomenology across a sizable slice of the relevant parameter space, finding a very small effect in most cases, except on highly energetic orbits. However, the predicted mass and spin variations are quantitatively and qualitatively very sensitive to the analytical representation chosen for the fluxes in that regime. We then perform comparisons with numerical relativity data of induced spins from hyperbolic encounters of initially nonrotating black holes, finding that the next-to-next-to-leading order factorized expressions we derive are crucial to reproduce the data. An optimization on the initial conditions (energy, angular momentum) is necessary for this, however, with differences of up to $9\%$ between the numerical and optimal initial data. Finally, we use our analytical expressions to model possible astrophysical implications for black holes in globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Static Spherical Spacetime in Extended Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our manuscript aims to analysis the viability and stability of anisotropic stellar objects in the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity. A particular model of this extended theory is considered to formulate explicit field equations which govern the interaction between matter and geometry. The configuration of static spherical symmetric structures is examined through the Finch-Skea solution. However, the values of unknown constants in the metric potentials are evaluated by the Darmois junction conditions. For the viability of proposed stellar objects, the physical parameters including density, pressure, anisotropy, mass, energy constraints, compactness function and redshift are analyzed. Furthermore, stability of the proposed stellar objects is investigated by causality condition, Herrera cracking approach and adiabatic index. Our findings indicate that the proposed stellar objects are viable as well as stable in the presence of correction terms.</description>

      <title>Stellar modeling via the Tolman IV solution: The cases of the massive pulsar J0740+6620 and the HESS J1731-347 compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model compact objects of known stellar mass and radius made of isotropic matter within Einstein's gravity. The interior solution describing hydrostatic equilibrium we are using throughout the manuscript corresponds to the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. The three free parameters of the solutions are determined imposing the matching conditions for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that contrary to the Kohler Chao solution, the Tolman IV solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. except for the relativistic adiabatic index that diverges at the surface of the stars. The divergence of the index $\Gamma$ may be resolved including a thin crust assuming a polytropic equation-of-state, which is precisely the case seen in studies of neutron stars. To the best of our knowledge, we model here for the first time the recently discovered massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 and the strangely light HESS compact object via the Tolman IV solution. The present work may be of interest to model builders as well as a useful reference for future research.</description>

      <title>Traces of Quantum Gravity Effects at Late time Cosmological Dynamics via Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the entropy-area relation of black hole thermodynamics, we study the thermodynamics of cosmological apparent horizon in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of an Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The adopted EUP naturally admits a minimal measurable momentum (equivalently a maximal measurable length), as an infrared cutoff in the theory. We derive the modified Friedmann equations in this setup and explore some predictions of these equations for the late time universe via distance measures. We show that in this framework it is possible to realize the late time cosmic speed-up and transition to the phantom phase of the equation of state parameter of the effective cosmic fluid without recourse to any dark energy component or modified gravity. Inspection of various distance measures in this framework shows that an EUP with a negative deformation parameter suffices for the interpretation of the late time asymptotically de Sitter universe with standard non-relativistic matter.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of motion is the important equation for obtain the extra force and Raychaudhuri equation. By considering an explicitly coupling between an arbitrary function of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet, G and the Lagrangian density of matter, it is shown that an extra force normal to their four-velocities arises. In this paper, we obtain the extra force and the generalized Raychaudhuri equation in F(G) modified theory of gravity in an imperfect fluid for the massive particle by divergence of energy momentum tensor so we earn extra force an Raychaudhuri equation in a compared with f(R) modified gravity for perfect fluid this conclusion giving the evolution of the kinematical quantities and describing the relative accelerations of nearby particles .</description>

      <title>On the art of designing effective space-times with free surface flows in Analogue Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating/decelerating trans-critical flows (waterfalls/cataracts) are analogous to space-times of black holes/white fountains since the pioneering work of Sch{\"u}tzhold \&amp;amp; Unruh in 2002. A single number is usually employed to classify trans-criticality namely the local depth Froude number which is the ratio between the local current speed and the local celerity of long gravity waves analogous to the light celerity. When the former reaches one, water waves are no more able to propagate upstream: the hydraulic black hole is a river of no return for them. At a higher level of understanding, two global dimensionless numbers, the upstream Froude number F r up and the obstruction ratio r up (the height of a bottom obstacle, the underlying geometry inducing the effective space-time, divided by the upstream water depth) are essential to distinguish subcritical, trans-critical and supercritical zones in the -F r up versus r up -hydraulic and nondispersive diagram. The relationship between both global parameters for transcritical flows turns out to be a peculiar limit of the behaviour of boats navigating in confined media like canals or locks with a generalized obstruction factor based on the ratio between the boat section and the canal section. Here, we revisit the classification of flows over obstacles in open water channel taking into account both effects of dispersion and scale, two neglected topics so far. For the first time, we give a complete classification of flows in an open water channel based on sub-pixel detection method measurements of the free surface supported by numerical simulations. We generalized the obstruction factor by a filling factor taking into account the maximum height of the water channel, a crucial parameter that was overlooked so far. Our ultimate purpose is to understand how to reproduce in the laboratory analogues of curved space-times from the dynamical point of view.</description>

      <title>All non-expanding gravitational waves in $D$-dimensional (anti-)de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete, theory-independent classification of $D$-dimensional Kundt spacetimes of Weyl and traceless-Ricci type N. We show that these geometries consist of three invariantly defined subfamilies, namely (generalized) Kundt, pp- and Siklos waves, for each of which we obtain a convenient canonical form. As a byproduct, this also demonstrates that all such metrics belong to the (A)dS-Kerr-Schild class. The role of these spacetimes in Einstein's gravity (including minimally coupled $p$-forms and non-linear electrodynamics) as non-expanding gravitational waves in an (anti)-de Sitter background is discussed. Furthermore, applications to extended theories such as Gauss-Bonnet, Lovelock, quadratic and $f(R)$ gravity are also briefly illustrated, as well as the overlap of the obtained metrics with universal and almost-universal spacetimes. In the appendices we additionally settle the issue of the redundancy of certain field equations for all Kundt spacetimes in a theory-independent way, and present various alternative coordinates for the spacetimes studied in the paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling in a quintessence background and the role of GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been made.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model for higher-dimensional spacetimes is studied. The higher-dimensional quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole is obtained by the junction condition. It turns out that quantum bounces always occur in the collapse thus that the classical gravitational collapse singularities are avoided. The scalar perturbations upon the quantum-corrected black holes are also studied. It turns out that the quantum corrections enhance the oscillation frequency in lower dimensions and decrease it in higher dimensions. Moreover, the thermodynamic laws of the quantum-corrected black holes imply that the Hawking temperature of quantum-corrected black hole decreases as the mass decreases in contrast to the classical situation. The behaviour of heat capacity indicates that quantum corrections introduce an extra phase transition of the black holes.</description>

      <title>Spinning LQG black hole as a particle accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spinning LQG black hole can act as a cosmic particle accelerator. The LQG solution is singularity-free and can possess spin greater than that of a Kerr black hole. The additional black hole hair, arising from quantum effects, significantly influences the particle dynamics around the black hole. Under suitable physical conditions, the center-of-mass energy can grow arbitrarily high during the collision of two generic particles in the spacetime of an extremal black hole. In the non-extremal case, there exists a finite upper bound on the center-of-mass energy, the maximum value of which depends on the LQG parameter. These results are particularly interesting from an astrophysical perspective, especially in the context of probing Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Singular lagrangians and the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism in classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work conducts a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of classical dynamical systems with internal constraints. We examine four systems, all previously analyzed by David Brown: three with familiar components (point masses, springs, rods, ropes, and pulleys) and one chosen specifically for its detailed illustration of the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm's logical steps. Including this fourth system allows for a direct and insightful comparison with the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, thereby deepening our understanding of both methods. To provide a thorough analysis, we classify the systems based on their constraints: non-involutive, involutive, and a combination of both. We then use generalized brackets to ensure the theory's integrability, systematically remove non-involutive constraints, and derive the equations of motion. This approach effectively showcases the Hamilton-Jacobi method's ability to handle complex constraint structures. Additionally, our study includes an analysis of a gauge system, highlighting the versatility and broad applicability of the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. By comparing our results with those from the Dirac-Bergmann and Faddeev-Jackiw algorithms, we demonstrate that the Hamilton-Jacobi approach is simpler and more efficient in its mathematical operations and offers advantages in computational implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of massive scalar-tensor theories on the internal properties, crystallization, and cooling process of white dwarf stars that might potentially solve observational tensions. We show that these modified gravity theories alter the inner structure of the star leading to sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. This further results in a modification of Debye temperature, ion and electron specific heats. Finally, we find that the cooling process is significantly shortened in scalar-tensor theories leading to reduced cooling ages.</description>

      <title>Black hole-de Sitter model, a proposal for the de Sitter phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand on the braneworld-black hole de Sitter model introduced in \cite{Rasulian} which is a proposal for constructing an effective de Sitter spacetime with no explicit dependence on brane tension or bulk cosmological constant. In this model the 4D de Sitter space emerges on a brane near the horizon of a 5D black hole. We study the effective gravity on the brane non-perturbatively, with an approximate Z2 symmetry assumption, up to a conformal factor, and find that the evolution of the effective cosmological constant on the brane depends on the flux of energy towards and away from the black hole in the bulk. In this setup the presence of the black hole horizon sets the initial condition for the brane's evolution and the brane approaches its null configuration with de Sitter length $l\lesssim l_5$, where $l_5$ is the 5D Planck's length, as soon as the horizon forms. During the last stages of collapse following this phase (or further flux of matter in the bulk after the horizon is formed), the effective de Sitter length on the brane increases due to the in-falling flux relatively fast. This phase is tentatively the transition between a low scale inflationary phase and the late dark energy phase. Also we observe that the increase in the de Sitter length is accompanied with a flux of energy entering the brane due to the jump in the bulk flux across the brane. Considering the initial state of the brane to be in the $l_5$ neighborhood of the horizon, the configuration which is slightly below the horizon is Euclidean AdS with AdS radius $l\lesssim l_5$. This can be interpreted as a boundary proposal for the resulting cosmology.</description>

      <title>Disk mass after a binary neutron star merger as a constraining parameter for short Gamma Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The coincident detection of GW170817 and GRB170817A marked a milestone for the connection between binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). These mergers can lead to the formation of a black hole surrounded by a disk and the generation of a powerful jet. It spends energy to break free from the merger ejecta, and then a portion of it, is dissipated to produce observable emissions. Aims. Our primary goal is to enhance our comprehension of BNS mergers by constraining the disk mass for a selection of sGRBs, utilizing isotropic gamma-ray luminosity and corresponding emission times as key indicators. Methods. In this study, we leverage data from GW170817 to estimate the disk mass surrounding the BNS merger remnant and subsequently infer the accretion-to-jet efficiency. Then statistically examine other sGRBs observations to estimate the possibility of being induced by BNS mergers Results. Our findings suggest that, when employing similar physical parameters as in the sole observed BNS-powered GRB event, GRB170817A, a substantial fraction of sGRBs necessitate an unrealistically massive disk remnant. Conclusions. This observation raises the possibility that either a different mechanis</description>

Abstract: Analytic continuations of holographic entanglement entropy in which the boundary subregion extends along a timelike direction have brought a promise of a novel, time-centric probe of the emergence of spacetime. We propose that the bulk carriers of this holographic timelike entanglement entropy are boundary-anchored extremal surfaces probing analytic continuation of holographic spacetimes into complex coordinates. This proposal not only provides a geometric interpretation of all the known cases obtained by direct analytic continuation of closed-form expressions of holographic entanglement entropy of a strip subregion but crucially also opens a window to study holographic timelike entanglement entropy in full generality. We initialize the investigation of complex extremal surfaces anchored on a timelike strip at the boundary of anti-de Sitter black branes. We find multiple complex extremal surfaces and discuss possible principles singling out the physical contribution.</description>

      <title>First part of Clausius heat theorem in terms of Noether's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-shell methods have found a new application to local observables such as asymptotic radiation fields and gravitational waveforms. While these observables are invariant under small gauge transformations, they are known to depend on a choice of asymptotic gauge; in gravity on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes, this is a choice of BMS frame. In this letter, we provide a method for capturing these supertranslations, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the on-shell framework of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear d'Alembert comparison theorem and causal differential calculus on metric measure spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational first-order Sobolev calculus on metric measure spacetimes. The key object is the maximal weak subslope of an arbitrary causal function, which plays the role of the (Lorentzian) modulus of its differential. It is shown to satisfy certain chain and Leibniz rules, certify a locality property, and be compatible with its smooth analog. In this setup, we propose a quadraticity condition termed infinitesimal Minkowskianity, which singles out genuinely Lorentzian structures among Lorentz-Finsler spacetimes. Moreover, we establish a comparison theorem for a nonlinear yet elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian in a weak form under the timelike measure contraction property. As a particular case, this extends Eschenburg's classical estimate past the timelike cut locus.</description>

      <title>Cocoon shock breakout emission from binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock breakout emission is among the first observable signals in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including neutron star (NS) mergers, and it can be the dominant component in low-luminosity short gamma-ray bursts (llsGRBs), as exemplified by GRB 170817A. In this work, we investigate the cocoon shock breakout emission in NS mergers and how its signal depends on the outermost layers of the ejecta profile, which we derive from general relativistic radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We study the formation of the cocoon as a consequence of a relativistic jet propagating through the ejecta. To explore the influence of the outermost layers of the ejecta on the breakout emission, we explore cases where the ejecta has a sharp cutoff or an extended smooth tail. We find that the shock breakout emission is strongly influenced by the shape of the ejecta outer layers, with extended tails yielding results consistent with the observed properties of GRB 170817A, whereas sharp cutoffs overestimate the radiated energy. Using a Bayesian analysis, we estimate the best fit parameters of the central engine, considering both accreting black hole and magnetized neutron star scenarios. Our findings indicate a slight preference for the scenarios where the engine is a black hole. Our work probes the nature of neutron star mergers and highlights the importance of the shape of the ejecta profile in modeling early electromagnetic counterparts to these mergers.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of the inflationary dynamics are presented here for a single canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We spell out the basic equations governing the inflationary dynamics in terms of cosmic time $t$ and define a set of dimensionless variables convenient for numerical analysis. We then provide a link to our simple numerical Python code on GitHub that can be used to simulate the background dynamics as well as the evolution of linear perturbations during inflation. The code computes both scalar and tensor power spectra for a given inflaton potential $V(\phi)$. We discuss a concrete algorithm to use the code for various purposes, especially for computing the enhanced scalar power spectrum in the context of Primordial Black Holes and scalar-induced Gravitational Waves. We also compare the efficiency of different variables used in the literature to compute the scalar fluctuations. We intend to extend the framework to simulate the dynamics of a number of different quantities, including the computation of scalar-induced second-order tensor power spectrum in the near future.</description>

      <title>General mass formulas for charged Kerr-AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the mass of a non-asymptotically flat spacetime cannot be uniquely defined. Some mass formulas for the Kerr-AdS black hole have been found and used in studying black hole thermodynamics. However, the derivations usually need a background subtraction to eliminate the divergence at infinity. It is also unknown whether the mass depends on the choice of coordinates. In this paper, we provide a more straightforward derivation for the mass formula, only demanding that the first law of black hole thermodynamics and Smarr formula are satisfied. We first make use of the Iyer-Wald formalism to derive a first law which avoids the divergence at infinity. Then we apply this formula to charged Kerr-AdS black hole expressed in the coordinates rotating at infinity. However, the first law associated with the timelike Killing vector field $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is not integrable. Then, by making use of the gauge freedom of $t$, we find a favorite parameter $t'$ which just makes the mass integrable. Applying the scaling argument, we show that the mass satisfies the Smarr formula and takes the form $M/\Xi^{3/2}$. Moreover, applying the conformal method with $\ppn{}{t'}$, we obtain the same mass. By applying the first law to the coordinates which is not rotating at infinity, we find a preferred time $T$ that makes the first law integrable and the mass is just the familiar mass $M/\Xi^2$ in the literature. This mass is also confirmed by the conformal method. We find that the two mass formulas correspond to different families of observers and the preferred Killing times. So our work clarifies the ambiguities of mass in Kerr-AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Efficient gravitational-wave model for fully-precessing and moderately-eccentric, compact binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future gravitational-wave detectors, especially the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be sensitive to black hole binaries formed in astrophysical environments that promote large eccentricities and spin-induced orbital precession. Approximate models of gravitational waves that include both effects have only recently begun to be developed. The Efficient Fully Precessing Eccentric (EFPE) family is one such model, covering the inspiral stage with small-eccentricity-expanded gravitational-wave amplitudes accurate for initial time eccentricities $e &lt; 0.3$ at 4 years before reaching an orbital frequency of 1 Hz. In this work, we extend this model to cover a larger range of initial eccentricities. The new EFPE for moderate eccentricities (EFPE_ME) model is able to accurately represent the leading-order gravitational-wave amplitudes to $e \leq 0.8$. Comparing the EFPE and the EFPE_ME models in the LISA band, however, reveals that there is no significant difference when the eccentricity at 4 years before merger, $e_0$, is less than or equal to 0.5, as radiation reaction circularizes supermassive black hole binaries too quickly. This suggests that the EFPE model may have a larger regime of validity in eccentricity space than previously thought, making it suitable for some inspiral parameter estimation with LISA data. On the other hand, for systems with $e_0 &gt; 0.5$, the deviations between the models are significant, particularly for binaries with total masses below $10^5\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This suggests that the EFPE_ME model will be crucial to avoid systematic bias in parameter estimation with LISA in the future, once this model has been hybridized to include the merger and ringdown and the computation of the amplitudes is optimized.</description>

Abstract: We analyze consequences of trying to replace dark matter and dark energy with models of stochastic spacetime. In particular, we analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that ``post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has four basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations, and (iv) we also identify some theoretical problems in these models.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a new wormhole solution in General Relativity supported by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the Casimir effect between perfect chromometallic mirrors in $(3+1)$ dimensions, which was recently fitted using first-principle numerical simulations. Initially, we employ a perturbative approach for $x = m r \ll 1$, where $m$ represents the Casimir mass. This approach has proven to be a reasonable approximation when compared with the exact case in this regime. To find well-behaved redshift functions, we impose constraints on the free parameters. As expected, this solution recovers the electromagnetic-like Casimir solution for $m = 0$. Analyzing the traversability conditions, we graphically find that all will be satisfied for $ 0 \leq m \leq 0.20$. On the other hand, all the energy conditions are violated, as usual in this context. Stability from Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation is guaranteed for all $r$ and from the speed of sound for $0.16 \le m \le 0.18$. Therefore, for $0.16 \leq m \leq 0.18$, we will have a stable solution that satisfies all traversability conditions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new method to investigate signatures of a quantum gravity phase in the primordial state of cosmological perturbations. We formulate and study a quantum model of a perturbed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe beyond a tensor-product Born-Oppenheimer-like factorization, that is, without restricting the wave function of the universe to the product of the background and perturbation wave functions. We show that the quantum dynamics generically does not preserve the product form of the universe's wave function, which spontaneously evolves into a more general entangled state. Upon expanding this state in a suitable basis of background wave functions and setting Gaussian initial conditions for the perturbations, we numerically find that each of these wave functions becomes associated with a non-Gaussian state of an inhomogeneous perturbation.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the signatures of a non-commutative black hole solution. Initially, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system, including entropy, heat capacity, and Hawking radiation. For the latter quantity, we employ two distinct methods: surface gravity and the topological approach. Additionally, we examine the emission rate and remnant mass within this context. Remarkably, the lifetime of the black hole, after reaching its final state due to the evaporation process, is expressed analytically up to a grey-body factor. We estimate the lifetime for specific initial and final mass configurations. Also, we analyze the tensorial quasinormal modes using the 6th-order WKB method. Finally, we study the deflection angle, i.e., gravitational lensing, in both the weak and strong deflection limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a rotating black hole with electric and magnetic monopole charges that moves in a static homogeneous electromagnetic field. We assume that both the charges and the fields are weak, so that they have no effect on the spacetime geometry, which is described by the Kerr metric. We present exact solutions to Maxwell's equations describing the field of a charged rotating black hole moving in an external field background. We use these solutions to calculate the energy, momentum, and angular momentum fluxes of the electromagnetic field into the black hole. Using these results, we obtain expressions for the torque and force acting on the moving charged rotating black hole arising as a result of its interaction with the external electromagnetic field. We calculate these quantities both in the frame comoving with the black hole and in the frame of the external background field. We use this result to derive the equations that govern the change in the black hole's mass and spin, as well as the motion of the black hole. We provide exact solutions for specific cases which illustrate the role of charge and spin on the motion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Charging the Love numbers: Charged scalar response coefficients of Kerr-Newman black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electrically-charged massless scalar response to the general Kerr-Newman black hole and obtain the exact (complex) response coefficients, whose real parts are the Love numbers. We find there is a curious discontinuity between the neutral and charged scalar. The Love numbers vanish for the neutral scalar, but are inversely proportional to the electric charge of the scalar in the small charge limit. We study the near-zone of the dynamical equation with non-vanishing frequency $\omega$, and show that the system have an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Love-like symmetry. The symmetry selects a special frequency $\omega_{\rm cr}$, which vanishes in the neutral case, so that the real part of the response coefficient vanishes identically. We also generalize the results into higher dimensions to some extend.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on fluid dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>

      <title>Resolving FLRW Cosmology Through Effective Equations of State in $f(T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores the cosmological scenario of the universe in the context of the $f(T)$ power law model, where $T$ represent the torsion scalar. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations we parametrized the effective Equation-of-State with two parameters $m$ and $k$ as suggested by A. Mukherjee in a flat FLRW environment. We impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solution by utilizing MCMC analysis assuming the $CC, Pantheon+SH0ES$, and $CC+Pantheon+SH0ES$ as data samples. We explore the dynamics of cosmological parameters. The evolutionary profile of the deceleration parameter exhibits the transition %from the decelerated to the accelerated phase. The effective Equation-of-State parameter indicates the model remains in the quintessence era and gradually becomes the Einsteins-de-Sitter model. In addition to this, we also explore the jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. Furthermore, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows that the model has a consistent positive slope across the entire evolution, but resembles the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future. At last, we conclude that the power law function of the modified $f(T)$ gravity model in the framework of the FLRW universe aligns more closely with the $\Lambda$CDM model for given observational data.</description>

      <title>The constraint on modified black holes with extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy effective action of String Theory introduces corrections to the dilaton-graviton sector, resulting in deformed black holes beyond general relativity. We analyze extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs), where a stellar-mass object spirals into a slowly rotating supermassive black hole including a distinct deviation parameter. This study examines the effects of this deformation on gravitational wave fluxes, orbital evolution, and phase dynamics, incorporating leading-order post-Newtonian corrections. With one-year observations of EMRIs, we employ the Fisher information matrix method to evaluate the potential for detecting deviations from general relativity through space-based gravitational wave detectors that utilize time-delay interferometry to suppress laser noise. The constraint on modified black holes, $\Delta\alpha \preceq 10^{-5}$, is almost the same with and without the time-delay interferometry combination. This analysis enhances our understanding and underscores the crucial role of observations in advancing gravitational phenomena within String Theory.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Study on Dark Matter-Dominated Systems: Further Analysis for galactic dark matter halos with Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low surface brightness galaxies are an excellent laboratory where stars and baryonic matter act as tracers of the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo. If dark matter is modeled as a perfect fluid, then spherically symmetric and static dark matter halos in hydrostatic equilibrium demand that dark matter should have an intrinsic pressure that counteracts the gravitational attraction that the dark matter halo exerts on itself. This static fluid (dark matter-dominated system, where the presence of baryons is negligible) has a specific equation of state for each rotational velocity profile of the stars in galaxies. In this work, we study the dark matter equation of state needed for the self-gravitating object to produce a gravitational potential such that the tracers follow the Universal Rotational Velocity Profile for stars of spiral galaxies proposed by Persic et al. (1996) and analyze the properties of the self-gravitating structures that emerge from this equation of state.The resulting configurations explaining the observed rotational speeds are found to be unstable. We conclude that the halo is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is nonspherically symmetric, or it is not static if the universal velocity profile should be valid for fitting the rotational velocity curve of the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Standard siren cosmology in the era of the 2.5-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors: bright and dark sirens of LIGO Voyager and NEMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2.5-generation (2.5G) ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors LIGO Voyager and NEMO are expected to be operational in the late 2020s and early 2030s. In this work, we explore the potential of GW standard sirens observed by the 2.5G GW detectors in measuring cosmological parameters, especially for the Hubble constant. Using GWs to measure cosmological parameters is inherently challenging, especially for 2.5G detectors, given their limited capability, which results in weaker constraints on cosmological parameters from the detected standard sirens. However, the measurement of the Hubble constant using standard siren observations from Voyager and NEMO is still promising. For example, using bright sirens from Voyager and NEMO can measure the Hubble constant with a precision of about $2\%$ and $6\%$ respectively, and using the Voyager-NEMO network can improve the precision to about $1.6\%$. Moreover, bright sirens can be used to break the degeneracy of cosmological parameters generated by CMB data, and to a certain extent, 2.5G detectors can also play a role in this aspect. Observations of dark sirens by 2.5G detectors can achieve relatively good results in measuring the Hubble constant, with a precision of within $2\%$, and if combining observations of bright and dark sirens, the precision of the Hubble constant measurement can reach about $1.4\%$. Finally, we also discussed the impact of the uncertainty in the binary neutron star merger rate on the estimation of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the magnificent prospect for solving the Hubble tension is worth expecting in the era of the 2.5G ground-based GW detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One key piece of evidence for dark matter is the flat rotation curve problem: the disagreement between measured galactic rotation curves and their luminous mass. A novel solution to this problem is presented here. A model of relativistic frame effects on Doppler shifts due to the slightly curved frames of an emitting galaxy and the Milky Way is derived. This model predicts observed Doppler shifted spectra (in excess of the luminous mass) based only on the observed luminous matter profile and one free model parameter. Fits to the 175 galaxies reported in the SPARC database of galactic rotation profiles and accurate photometry measurements are compared between this novel model and dark matter and MOND (RAR) models. We find on the SPARC sample of 175 galaxies; that MOND-RAR has an average reduced chisquare of $\chi^2_r = 4.22$ for 175 galaxies fitted, the isothermal dark matter model has $\chi^2_r = 1.90$ for 165 galaxies fitted, and the new model we present has $\chi^2_r = 2.39$ for 172 galaxies fitted. Implications of this model are discussed.</description>

Abstract: I discuss singular loci in the phase spaces of theories which lack globally well-defined numbers of dynamical modes. This is a topic which appears quite often in the recent literature on modified gravity. In particular, there were discussions about $R^2$ gravity around Minkowski space. It is a relatively simple case, and still there were some confusions. It clearly shows that one should be very accurate when trying to understand a potentially problematic theory through perturbations around a simply looking background. At the same time, many modern teleparallel approaches are laden with even more severe issues. Therefore, it is a topic which is certainly worth carefully thinking about.</description>

      <title>asimulation: Domain formation and impact on observables in resolved cosmological simulations of the (a)symmetron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetron is a dark energy and dark matter candidate that forms topological defects in the late-time universe and holds the promise of resolving some of the cosmological tensions. We performed high-resolution simulations of the dynamical and non-linear (a)symmetron using the recently developed relativistic N-body code asevolution. By extensively testing the temporal and spatial convergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall stability, we determined criteria and physical intuition for the convergence. We applied the resolution criteria to run five high-resolution simulations with 1280^3 grids and a box size of 500 Mpc/h of the (a)symmetron. We considered the behaviour of the scalar field and the domain walls in each scenario. We find the effect on the matter power spectra, the HMFs, and observables computed over the past light cone of an observer, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and non-linear Rees-Sciama effect and the lensing, compared to LCDM. We show local oscillations of the fifth force strength and the formation of planar structures in the density field. The dynamics of the field was visualised in animations with high resolution in time. The simulation code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Clustering of primordial black holes from quantum diffusion during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how large fluctuations are spatially correlated in the presence of quantum diffusion during inflation. This is done by computing real-space correlation functions in the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. We first derive an exact description of physical distances as measured by a local observer at the end of inflation, improving on previous works. Our approach is based on recursive algorithmic methods that consistently include volume-weighting effects. We then propose a "large-volume'' approximation under which calculations can be done using first-passage time analysis only, and from which a new formula for the power spectrum in stochastic inflation is derived. We then study the full two-point statistics of the curvature perturbation. Due to the presence of exponential tails, we find that the joint distribution of large fluctuations is of the form $P(\zeta_{R_1}, \zeta_{R_2}) = F(R_1,R_2,r) P(\zeta_{R_1})P( \zeta_{R_2})$, where $\zeta_{R_1}$ and $\zeta_{R_2}$ denote the curvature perturbation coarse-grained at radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, around two spatial points distant by $r$. This implies that, on the tail, the reduced correlation function, defined as $P(\zeta_{R_1}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}}, \zeta_{R_2}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}})/[P(\zeta_{R_1}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}}) P(\zeta_{R_2}&gt;\zeta_{\rm{c}})]-1$, is independent of the threshold value $\zeta_{\rm{c}}$. This contrasts with Gaussian statistics where the same quantity strongly decays with $\zeta_{\rm{c}}$, and shows the existence of a universal clustering profile for all structures forming in the exponential tails. Structures forming in the intermediate (i.e. not yet exponential) tails may feature different, model-dependent behaviours.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$ equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the previous results in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <title>In-in formalism for the entropy of quantum fields in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to compute the purity and entanglement entropy for quantum fields in a systematic perturbative expansion. To that end, we generalize the in-in formalism to non-unitary dynamics (i.e. accounting for the presence of an environment) and to the calculation of quantum information measures, which are not observables in the usual sense. This allows us to reduce the problem to one involving standard correlation functions, and to organize their computation in a diagrammatic expansion for which we construct the corresponding Feynman rules. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to a cosmological setting inspired by the effective field theory of inflation. We find that at late times, non-linear loop corrections share the same time behavior as the linear contribution, and only yield a slight redressing of the purity. In particular, when the environment is heavy compared to the Hubble scale, the phenomenon of recoherence previously encountered is robust to the class of non-linear extensions considered. Bridging the gap between perturbative quantum field theory and open quantum systems paves the way to a better understanding of renormalization and resummation in open effective field theories. It also enables a more systematic exploration of quantum information properties in field theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Signatures of Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes with Circumbinary Disks in LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes may have circumbinary disks if formed through common-envelope evolution or within gaseous environments. Disks can drive binaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden and circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for disk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven evolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity, $0.2\lesssim e_\mathrm{eq} \lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once they transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases rapidly; we find that stellar-mass binary black holes with long-lived disks will likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\sim 10^{-2}$ at $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's initial mass ratio. This may lead stellar-mass binary black holes with CBDs observed in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.</description>

Abstract: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution is regular, free from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>
