      <title>Shocks-adaptive Robust Minimum Variance Portfolio for a Large Universe of Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust, shocks-adaptive portfolio in a large-dimensional assets universe where the number of assets could be comparable to or even larger than the sample size. It is well documented that portfolios based on optimizations are sensitive to outliers in return data. We deal with outliers by proposing a robust factor model, contributing methodologically through the development of a robust principal component analysis (PCA) for factor model estimation and a shrinkage estimation for the random error covariance matrix. This approach extends the well-regarded Principal Orthogonal Complement Thresholding (POET) method (Fan et al., 2013), enabling it to effectively handle heavy tails and sudden shocks in data. The novelty of the proposed robust method is its adaptiveness to both global and idiosyncratic shocks, without the need to distinguish them, which is useful in forming portfolio weights when facing outliers. We develop the theoretical results of the robust factor model and the robust minimum variance portfolio. Numerical and empirical results show the superior performance of the new portfolio.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Portfolio Rebalancing: A Hybrid new Model Using GNNs and Pathfinding for Cost Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to optimizing portfolio rebalancing by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting transaction costs and Dijkstra's algorithm for identifying cost-efficient rebalancing paths. Using historical stock data from prominent technology firms, the GNN is trained to forecast future transaction costs, which are then applied as edge weights in a financial asset graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the least costly path for reallocating capital between assets. Empirical results show that this hybrid approach significantly reduces transaction costs, offering a powerful tool for portfolio managers, especially in high-frequency trading environments. This methodology demonstrates the potential of combining advanced machine learning techniques with classical optimization algorithms to improve financial decision-making processes. Future research will explore expanding the asset universe and incorporating reinforcement learning for continuous portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Cracking the code: Lessons from 15 years of digital health IPOs for the era of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: As digital health evolves, identifying factors that drive success is crucial. This study examines how reimbursement billing codes affect the long-term financial performance of digital health companies on U.S. stock markets, addressing the question: What separates the winners from the rest?
  Methods: We analyzed digital health companies that went public on U.S. stock exchanges between 2010 and 2021, offering products or services aimed at improving personal health or disease management within the U.S. market. A search using Google and existing IPO lists identified eligible companies. They were categorized based on the presence or absence of billing codes at the time of their initial public offering (IPO). Key performance indicators, including Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), relative performance to benchmark indices, and market capitalization change, were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's Exact tests.
  Results: Of the 33 companies analyzed, 15 (45.5%) had billing codes at IPO. The median IPO price was $17.00, with no significant difference between groups. Those with billing codes were 25.5 times more likely to achieve a positive CAGR. Their median market capitalization increased 56.3%, compared to a median decline of 80.1% for those without billing codes. All five top performers, in terms of CAGR, had billing codes at IPO, whereas nine of the ten worst performers lacked them. Companies without billing codes were 16 times more likely to experience a drop in market capitalization by the study's end.
  Conclusion: Founders, investors, developers and analysts may have overestimated consumers' willingness to pay out-of-pocket or underestimated reimbursement complexities. As the sector evolves, especially with AI-driven solutions, stakeholders should prioritize billing codes to ensure sustainable growth, financial stability, and maximized investor returns.</description>
