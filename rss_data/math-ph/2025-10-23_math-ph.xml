      <title>Poisson structures on weak Sobolev loop spaces and applications to integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for Poisson geometry on loop spaces of low regularity, extending Mokhov's classical constructions from smooth loops to weak Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{S^1},\mathbb{R}^m)$ with $o &lt; s \frac{1}{2}$ and $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty.$ Within this setting we construct presymplectic and Poisson structures of hydrodynamic type, as well as their weakly non local deformations involving inverse derivatives. The analytic backbone relies on the boundedness of fractional multipliers, Hilbert transforms, and Lipschitz Nemytski operators on $W^{s,p}$, which ensures that all operations used in Mokhov's formalisn remain well defined at this level of regularity. We further show that teh horizontal-vertical bicomplex underlying variational Poisson geometry can be extended to $W^{s,p},$ so that the cohomological arguments proving skew-symmetry and the Jacobi identity carry over verbatim. As an application, we embed the Hamiltonian formalisms of several integrable PDEs (KdV, nonlinear Schr\"odinger, Camassa--Holm, and hydrodynamic systems of Dubrovin--Novikov type) into this weak Sobolev setting. Local order-one Poisson operators and their weakly nonlocal extensions are shown to be well posed for $W^{s,p}$ loops, while higher-order operators (e.g. the second KdV bracket) require stronger regularity. Our results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for Poisson geometry on weak loop spaces and open the way for extending the Hamiltonian theory of integrable systems beyond the smooth category.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Anisotropic Rabi Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-parameter family of self-adjoint operators interpolating between the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian and its rotating-wave approximation is studied. A mathematically rigorous treatment of such interpolations has been lacking. Motivated by the physical claim that counter-rotating terms dominate at strong coupling, we analyze the limit in which the coupling constant of the anisotropic Rabi model tends to infinity. Our results provide an operator-theoretic description of this limit and clarify the spectral evolution from the rotating-wave approximation to the full Rabi model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to provide a good categorical setting to the many different spaces of fields arising in the description of physical theories, a pedagogical introduction to the categorical notion of smooth sets is provided and some simple properties of the topos of smooth sets are discussed. The introduction of geometrical structures into such spaces is illustrated via the specific examples of the tangent functor and the variational bicomplex.</description>

      <title>Constructing Local Symmetric Operator Algebras via Reflection Positivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for constructing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. Assuming reflection positivity, we prove the equivalence between the non-degeneracy of the ground state on the sphere and the local-indistinguishability of local ground states of a frustration-free Hamiltonian. We apply the Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) reconstruction to construct the local symmetric operator algebras, which characterize the emergent categorical symmetry in the ground states.</description>

      <title>Space-time resonances in the spatiotemporal spectrum of nonlinear dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In weakly nonlinear dispersive wave systems, long-time dynamics are typically governed by time resonances, where wave phases evolve coherently due to exact frequency matching. Recent advances in spatio-temporal spectrum measurements, however, reveal prominent features that go beyond the predictions of time resonance theory. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to interpret these signatures by identifying and characterizing an alternative mechanism: space resonances. These arise when wave packets share the same group velocity and remain co-located, leading to long-lived interactions. We further show that gauge-breaking terms in the Hamiltonian give rise to space resonances supported on negative frequencies. By combining sea-surface elevation data, numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we derive the leading-order spatio-temporal spectrum for weakly interacting water waves, providing a unified explanation for its observed features.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Analysis of Elastic Vector Solitons in Flexible Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a revised continuum model from the discrete system introduced in [Deng et.al., PRL, 2017] . Using a Galilean transformation, we obtain an equation governing the soliton solutions in the phase plane - a second-order nonlinear ODE related to the Klein-Gordon equation with quadratic nonlinearity. These admit the well-known $\mathrm{sech}^2$ solutions, which we employ as an ans\"atz following [Deng et.al., PRL, 2017]. The resulting analysis yields soliton amplitudes and velocities that agree closely with numerical simulations, achieving an improvement of exactly 1/9 relative to the benchmark reported by the Harvard group.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-induced vanishing of brane partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of 't Hooft anomalies, backgrounds for the symmetries of a quantum field theory can lead to non-conservation of Noether currents, or more generally, to the presence of charged insertions in the path integral. When there is a net background charge, the partition function evaluated on closed manifolds will vanish. For anomalous symmetries, this statement can also be understood as the anomaly theory giving rise to a non-trivial anomalous phase for the partition function even for "rigid" transformations which leave all background fields unchanged. We use the generalisation of this second viewpoint to the setting of anomalous higher-form symmetries in order to show vanishing of the partition function for a number of examples, both with and without a Lagrangian description. In particular, we show how to derive from these considerations the analogue of the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition for the M5-brane, and also that for the D3-brane in S-fold backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Approach to equilibrium for a particle interacting with a harmonic thermal bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long time evolution of the position-position correlation function $C_{\alpha,N}(s,t)$ for a harmonic oscillator (the {\it probe}) interacting via a coupling $\alpha$ with a large chain of $N$ coupled oscillators (the {\it heat bath}). At $t=0$ the probe and the bath are in equilibrium at temperature $T_P$ and $T_B$, respectively. We show that for times $t$ and $s$ of the order of $N$, $C_{\alpha,N}(s,t)$ is very well approximated by its limit $C_{\alpha}(s,t)$ as $N\to\infty$. We find that, if the frequency $\Omega$ of the probe is in the spectrum of the bath, the system appears to thermalize, at least at higher order in $\alpha$. This means that, at order 0 in $\alpha$, $C_\alpha(s,t)$ equals the correlation of a probe in contact with an ideal stochastic {\it thermostat}, that is forced by a white noise and subject to dissipation. In particular we find that $\lim_{t\to\infty} C_\alpha(t,t)=T_B/\Omega^2$ while that $\lim_{\tau\to\infty} C_\alpha(\tau,\tau+t)$ exists and decays exponentially in $t$. Notwithstanding this, at higher order in $\alpha$, $C_{\alpha}(s,t)$ contains terms that oscillate or vanish as a power law in $|t-s|$. That is, even when the bath is very large, it cannot be thought of as a stochastic thermostat. When the frequency of the bath is far from the spectrum of the bath, no thermalization is observed.</description>

      <title>Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</description>

Abstract: We present an elementary proof of existence of infinite family of time-periodic solutions to the one-dimensional nonlinear cubic wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. It relies on the first order perturbative expansion and uses the Banach contraction principle to show existence of nearby solutions. In contrast to the previous results, this approach provides us explicit information about the frequencies and structures of the obtained solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory in Successive Rindler Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study successive Rindler-like transformations in Minkowski spacetime and the corresponding sequence of vacuum states perceived by observers restricted to respective wedges. Extending the standard Rindler construction to an $n$-fold iteration, we find via Bogoliubov transformations that the vacuum of the $(n-1)^{th}$ Rindler observer appears thermal to the $n^{th}$ one. The characteristic trajectories, confined to nested wedges, exhibit characteristic accelerations and horizon shifts depending on transformation parameters ${g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_{n}}$. For the second-level transformation (\emph{Rindler Rindler} case), the late time acceleration asymptotically approaches $2g_2$ for one branch and diverges for the other. We study Minkowski, Rindler, and Rindler Rindler vacuum states from the perspective of Unruh DeWitt (UDW) detectors along inertial, Rindler, and Rindler Rindler trajectories. The response of the UDW detector coupled to a real massless scalar field confirms the thermality: the transition rate of Rindler Rindler observer in Minkowski vacuum matches that of a standard Rindler detector with acceleration $2g_2$, yielding a Planckian spectrum at late times. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional nonlocal degenerate fourth-order parabolic equation with inhomogeneous forces relevant to hydraulic fracture modeling. Employing a regularization scheme, modified energy/entropy methods, and novel differential inequality techniques, we establish global existence and long-time behavior results for weak solutions under both time-dependent and time-independent inhomogeneous forces. Specifically, for the time-dependent force $S(t, x)$, we prove that the solution converges in $H^s (\Omega )$ to $\bar{u}_0+\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_0^t \int_\Omega S(r, x)\, dxdr $, where $\bar{u}_0=\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}u_{0}(x)\,dx$ is the spatial average of the initial data. For the time-independent force $S(x)$, we prove that the difference between the weak solution and the linear function $\bar{u}_0 + \frac{t}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega S(x)\, dx$ remains uniformly bounded in $H^s (\Omega )$.</description>

      <title>Tyurin Degenerations, Derived Lagrangians and Categorification of DT Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the moduli space of rigidified perfect complexes with support on a general complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ and its Tyurin degeneration $X\rightsquigarrow X_1\cup_SX_2$ to a complete intersection of Fano threefolds $X_1,X_2$ meeting along their anti-canonical divisor $S$. The corresponding derived dg moduli scheme over the generic fiber degenerates to the (Fano) moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{1}, \mathcal{M}_{2},$ of perfect complexes supported on each Fano which glue after derived restriction to the relative divisor $S$. We prove that the total moduli space of the degeneration family carries a relative Lagrangian foliation structure, which implies the existence of a flat Gauss-Manin connection on periodic cyclic homology of the category of the matrix factorizations associated with fiber-wise moduli spaces, realized locally as the derived critical loci of suitable potential functions. The Fano moduli spaces each define derived Lagrangians in the (ambient) moduli space of restricted complexes to the relative divisor $S$. The flatness of the Gauss-Manin connection implies the derived geometric deformation invariance of the categorified DT-invariants associated to fiberwise matrix factorization categories, hence, the categorified DT-invariants of the generic fiber are expressed in terms of a derived intersection cohomology of the corresponding Fano moduli spaces on the special fiber.</description>

Abstract: Real eigenpairs of a real antisymmetric tensor of order $p$ and dimension $N$ can be defined as pairs of a real eigenvalue and $p$ orthonormal $N$-dimensional real eigenvectors. We compute the signed and the genuine distributions of such eigenvalues of Gaussian random real antisymmetric tensors by using a quantum field theoretical method. An analytic expression for finite $N$ is obtained for the signed distribution and the analytic large-$N$ asymptotic forms for both. We compute the edge of the distribution for large-$N$, one application of which is to give an upper bound (believed tight) of the injective norm of the random real antisymmetric tensor. We find a large-$N$ universality across various tensor eigenvalue distributions: the large-$N$ asymptotic forms of the distributions of the eigenvalues $z$ of the complex, complex symmetric, real symmetric, and real antisymmetric random tensors are all expressed by $e^{N\,B\, h_p(z_c^2/z^2)+o(N)}$, where the function $h_p(\cdot)$ depends only on the order $p$, while $B$ and $z_c$ differ for each case, $NB$ being the total dimension of the eigenvectors and $z_c$ being determined by the phase transition point of the quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Non-optimal domains for the helicity maximisation problem</title>

Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, D. DeTurck, H. Gluck and M. Teytel, J. Math. Phys. 41:5615 (2000)] the helicity isoperimetric problem which asks to find a smooth domain of fixed volume which maximises Biot-Savart helicity among all other smooth domains of fixed volume was initiated. It was shown that if an optimal domain exists, all of its boundary components must be tori.
  The present work extends these results by establishing additional geometric constraints which optimal domains, if they exist, must satisfy. This allows to rule out the optimality of a broad class of solid tori. The existence of optimal domains remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Beneath the kinetic interpretation of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion theory establishes a fundamental connection between stochastic differential equations and partial differential equations. The solution of a partial differential equation known as the Fokker-Planck equation describes the probability density of the stochastic process that solves a corresponding stochastic differential equation. The kinetic interpretation of noise refers to a prospective notion of stochastic integration that would connect a stochastic differential equation with a Fokker-Planck equation consistent with the Fick law of diffusion, without introducing correction terms in the drift. This work is devoted to identifying the precise conditions under which such a correspondence can occur. One of these conditions is a structural constraint on the diffusion tensor, which severely restricts its possible form and thereby renders the kinetic interpretation of noise a non-generic situation. This point is illustrated through a series of examples. Furthermore, the analysis raises additional questions, including the possibility of defining a stochastic integral inspired by numerical algorithms, the behavior of stochastic transport equations in heterogeneous media, and the development of alternative models for anomalous diffusion. All these topics are addressed using stochastic analytical tools similar to those employed to study the main problem: the existence of the kinetic interpretation of noise.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of bound-state solutions for nonlinear Dirac equation on noncompact quantum graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonrelativistic limit and qualitative properties of bound-state solutions for the nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) defined on noncompact quantum graphs: \[ -i c \frac{d}{d x} \sigma_1 \psi+m c^2 \sigma_3 \psi-\omega \psi=g(|\psi|) \psi, \quad \text { in } \mathcal{G} \] where \( g : \mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R} \) is a continuous nonlinear function, \( c&gt;0 \) represents the speed of light, \( m&gt;0 \) is the particle's mass, \( \omega\in\mathbb{R} \) is related to the frequency, \( \sigma_1 \) and \( \sigma_3 \) denote the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathcal{G}\) is a noncompact quantum graph. We establish the existence of bound-state solutions to the NLDE on \(\mathcal{G}\), and prove that these solutions converge toward the corresponding bound-state solutions of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) in the nonrelativistic limit (i.e., as the speed of light \( c \to \infty \)) for particles of small mass. Furthermore, we prove uniform boundedness and exponential decay properties of the NLDE solutions, uniformly in \( c \), thereby offering insight into their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>First Critical Field in the pinned three-dimensional Ginzburg--Landau Model: A matching upper bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our study of the first critical field $H_{c_1}$ for extreme type-II superconductors governed by the three-dimensional magnetic Ginzburg--Landau functional with a pinning term $a_\varepsilon$, as introduced in our previous work [arXiv:2507.10915]. Building upon the lower bound for $H_{c_1}$ and the characterization of the Meissner solution, we now establish a matching upper bound for $H_{c_1}$, thereby identifying its leading-order behavior. This result confirms the sharpness of the previously derived lower bound and further elucidates the connection between the onset of vorticity and a weighted variant of the \emph{isoflux problem}. Our argument is prompted by the upper bound construction we developed in [arXiv:2510.14910], based on the Biot--Savart law.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason, edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf. Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits, systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$ at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale, combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger $K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal polynomials related to quantum transport theory of disordered wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03720v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics of the biorthogonal polynomials associated to the biorthogonal ensemble with the joint probability density function \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{C} \prod_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} (\lambda_j -\lambda_i)(f(\lambda_j) - f(\lambda_i)) \prod^n_{j = 1} W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(\lambda_j) d\lambda_j, \end{equation*} where \begin{align*} f(x) = {}&amp; \sinh^2(\sqrt{x}), &amp; W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(x) = {}&amp; x^{\alpha} h(x) e^{-nV(x)}. \end{align*} In the special case that the potential function $V$ is linear, this biorthogonal ensemble arises in the quantum transport theory of disordered wires. We analyze the asymptotic problem via $2$-component vector-valued Riemann-Hilbert problems, and solve it under the one-cut regular with a hard edge condition. We use the asymptotics of biorthogonal polynomials to establish sine universality for the correlation kernel in the bulk, and provide a central limit theorem with a specific variance for holomorphic linear statistics.
  As an application of our theories, we establish the Ohm's law (1.12) and universal conductance fluctuation (1.13) for the disordered wire model, thereby rigorously confirming predictions from experimental physics [Washburn-Webb86].</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between Cartan symmetries, dynamical similarities, and dynamical symmetries in contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By introducing an alternative decomposition of vector fields, we characterize these symmetries and present a novel description in terms of tensor densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows, under specific conditions, for the recovery of integrals of motion. We also establish new criteria to assess their independence.</description>

      <title>The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant method for maximum simplification of the field strength in non-Abelian Yang-Mills theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:1306.2174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new local gauge invariant method is introduced in order to maximally simplify the expression for a SU(2) non-Abelian field strength. The new tetrads introduced in previous works are going to play a fundamental role in the algorithm presented in this manuscript. Three new local gauge invariant objects are going to guide us through the process of making a field strength block diagonal. The process is also covariant. Any non-trivial isospace field strength projection will become block diagonal through this gauge invariant algorithm. As an application we will find new local observables in Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley--Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay with respect to distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with respect to the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been believed to hold for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement can exist due to the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the entanglement Hamiltonian or Hamiltonian of mean force. As an outcome of our analyses, we improve the prior clustering theorem for bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Hidden Curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been noticed since around 2007 that certain enumeration problems can be solved when an analytic or algebraic curve is identified. This curve is the key to the problem. In these lectures, a few such examples are presented. One is a detailed account on counting simple Hurwitz numbers, explaining how the problem was solved by discovering this key curve. The formula for the curve allows us to write the generating functions of Hurwitz numbers in terms of polynomials. This unexpected polynomiality produces, as a byproduct, straightforward and short proofs of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem and the $\lambda_g$-theorem of Faber-Pandharipande. An analogous enumeration problem associated with Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of analysis. The asymptotic behavior of counting leads this time to the Euler characteristic of the moduli spaces of smooth curves. We then discuss another enumeration problem, the Ap\'ery sequences. The quest of identifying the hidden curve for this case remains open.
  These curves, also known as spectral curves, are discovered via solving ordinary differential equations. The counting problem of geometric origin associated with the genus 0, one marked point case is encoded in the spectral curve. It is explained that going from the $(g,n)=(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$ is a process of quantization of the spectral curve.
  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when the differential equations are linear with holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs bundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context, however, there are no counting problems behind the scene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove power-law dynamical localization for polynomial long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field under any bounded perturbation. Actually, we introduce new arguments in the study of dynamical localization for long-range models with unbounded potentials, involving the Min-Max Principle and a notion of Power-Law ULE. Unlike existing results in the literature, our approach does not rely on KAM techniques or on Green's function estimates, but rather on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the potential. It is worth underlining that our general results can be applied to other models, such as Maryland-type potentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of Weyl anomalies, measuring the violation of local scale invariance, in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes in the framework of locally covariant field theory. We discuss some general properties of Weyl anomalies, such as their relation to the trace anomaly. We give a criterion for a theory to be conformal at the quantum level, and show that even for a conformal theory Weyl transformations in general obtain quantum corrections. We study the trace anomaly in detail for the $\phi^4$ theory, in particular determining it up to second order in the interaction. We also show that at third order in the interaction a potential $\Box \phi^2$ term can be removed by finite renormalization.</description>

      <title>The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they represent exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state (PEPS), emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents of a $q$-deformation phase transition.</description>

      <title>Flat-band thermodynamics reveals enhanced performance across Otto, Carnot, and Stirling cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of a Special Solution to the (3,4) String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic properties a special solution of the $(3,4)$ string equation, which appears in the study of the multicritical quartic $2$-matrix model. In particular, we show that in a certain parameter regime, the corresponding $\tau$-function has an asymptotic expansion which is `topological' in nature. Consequently, we show that this solution to the string equation with a specific set of Stokes data exists, at least asymptotically. We also demonstrate that, along specific curves in the parameter space, this $\tau$-function degenerates to the $\tau$-function for a tritronqu\'{e}e solution of Painlev\'{e} I (which appears in the critical quartic $1$-matrix model), indicating that there is a `renormalization group flow' between these critical points. This confirms a conjecture from [1].

      <title>Algebra structure of conformal Killing-Yano forms in geometries with skew-symmetric torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider conformal Killing-Yano forms corresponding to the antisymmetric generalizations of conformal Killing vectors to higher degree forms in the presence of skew-symmetric torsion. Integrability conditions for torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms are found and a graded Lie bracket for conformal Killing-Yano forms to constitute a graded Lie algebra structure is proposed. It is found that a graded Lie algebra structure for a special subset of torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms can be constructed for a closed and parallel skew-symmetric torsion on constant curvature and Einstein manifolds. Similar structure for generalized hidden symmetries defined from generalized connection in generalized geometry is also constructed.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Spectral Small-Incremental-Entangling: Breaking Quasi-Polynomial Complexity Barriers in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How the detailed structure of quantum complexity emerges from quantum dynamics remains a fundamental challenge highlighted by advances in quantum simulators and information processing. The celebrated Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem provides a universal constraint on the rate of entanglement generation, yet it leaves open the problem of fully characterizing fine entanglement structures. Here we introduce the concept of Spectral-Entangling strength, which captures the structural entangling power of an operator, and establish a spectral SIE theorem: a universal speed limit for R'enyi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ decay threshold in the entanglement spectrum. Remarkably, our bound at $\alpha=1/2$ is both qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, defining the universal threshold beyond which entanglement growth becomes unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients and enables rigorous truncation-based error control, linking entanglement structure to computational complexity. Building on this, we derive a generalized entanglement area law under an adiabatic-path condition, extending a central principle of quantum many-body physics to general interactions. As a concrete application, we show that one-dimensional long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states, thereby closing the long-standing quasi-polynomial gap and demonstrating that such systems can be simulated efficiently with tensor-network methods. By explicitly controlling R'enyi entanglement, we obtain a rigorous, a priori error guarantee for the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend the SIE theorem to the spectral domain and establish a unified framework that unveils the detailed and universal structure underlying quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Dyson Trace Flow and Multivariate Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting random matrix systems are fundamental to modern theoretical physics and data science, yet a unified framework for their analysis has been lacking. This work introduces such a universal framework, built upon two novel concepts: the Dyson Trace Flow characterizing macroscopic fluctuations, and the Multivariate Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law describing the collective spectral behavior of multiple interacting matrix processes. We establish the stochastic evolution of eigenvalues under asymmetric coupling and prove the mathematical well-posedness of the theory. A large deviation principle is derived, enabling the calculation of rare event probabilities. The framework is extended to nonlinear and non-reciprocal interactions, revealing universal phenomena including exceptional points, bistability, and novel scaling laws. A striking connection to quantum chaos is unveiled through a holographic correspondence with wormhole geometries. By generalizing classical random matrix theory, this work provides powerful tools for understanding neural networks and complex quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields on radiative asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the "$i\varepsilon$ prescription" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting. Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem, we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A,B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the analytic witness gap $\Delta(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$. The sign change of $\Delta(\omega)$ across the Squier positivity window reveals alternating constructive and destructive interference of causal orders, a hallmark of non-Abelian control, while $\Delta(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability. Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a Gedankenexperiment in anyonic statistics.</description>
