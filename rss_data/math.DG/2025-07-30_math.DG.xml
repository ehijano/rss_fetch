      <title>Curvature operator and Euler number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,g)$ be a compact $n$-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold with a lower bound on the average of the lowest $n-p$ eigenvalues of the curvature operator and the diameter of $X$ is bounded above by $D&gt;0$. In this article, we investigate the relationship between the curvature operator and the Euler number of $X$. Our analysis is based on more general vanishing theorems for a Dirac operator associated with a smooth $1$-form on $X$. As a consequence, we obtain partial affirmative answers to Question 4.6 posed by Herrmann, Sebastian, and Tuschmann in \cite{HST}. Specifically, we prove that if a compact $2m$-dimensional manifold admits an almost nonnegative curvature operator (ANCO) and has a nontrivial first de Rham cohomology group, then its Euler number vanishes. Furthermore, in the case where $m=2$, we show that the Euler number is nonnegative. This result provides a complete resolution to their question in the four-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>A simple generalization of Garsia's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a natural generalization of a conjecture by Garsia, originally concerning the realization of conformal classes of genus-1 surfaces via embeddings in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This generalized conjecture is formulated within the framework of connections on principal bundles. We address this conjecture by providing solutions in several natural cases. As an outcome, our work yields novel parameterizations of the moduli space of conformal classes of compact surfaces of genus 1, each endowed with a clear geometric interpretation.</description>

      <title>Surfaces in a strict Walker 3-manifold that contain non-null curve with zero torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a non-null curve $\gamma$ in a strict Walker 3-manifold, first we show that (locally) $\gamma$ lies in a flat cylinder with a null axis. Secondly, we construct an example of such a curve $\gamma$ and such a cylinder $S$ that contains $\gamma$ . In particular, the hypothesis that $S$ is totally geodesic has some consequence on the geometry of the ambient Walker 3-manifold.</description>

      <title>Free boundary minimal M\"obius band in spherical caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compactly free boundary minimal submanifolds in spherical caps $\Br$ and their geometric spectral properties. Following the foundational work of Fraser-Schoen \cite{FS2012}, Lima-Menezes \cite{LM23} established the connection between free boundary minimal surfaces in spherical caps and spectral geometry. In this work, we present three main contributions: (1) We prove that any free boundary minimal M\"obius band in $\Br$ immersed by first Steklov eigenfunctions must be intrinsically rotationally symmetric ; (2) We explicitly construct such a M\"obius band in $\mathbb{B}^4(r)$ for $0&lt;r&lt;\frac{\pi}{2}$; and (3) We generalize Morse index estimates for free boundary minimal submanifolds in spherical caps, showing that non totally geodesic immersions have index at least $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a $1/\kappa^{n}$-type area-preserving non-local flow of convex closed plane curves for any $n&gt;0$. We show that the flow exists globally, the length of evolving curve is
  non-increasing, and the limiting curve will be a circle in the $C^{\infty}$ metric as time $t\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic Plateau problem in hyperbolic space for constant sum Hessian curvature. More precisely, given a asymptotic boundary $\Gamma$, one seeks a complete hypersurface $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ satisfying $\sigma_{n-1}(\kappa)+\alpha\sigma_{n}(\kappa)=\sigma\in (0,n),\,\,\partial \Sigma=\Gamma$ where $\alpha$ is a non-negative number.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces of six-dimensional nearly K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of six-dimensional homogeneous nearly K\"ahler manifolds, we prove that $\mathbb S^6$ is the only ambient space admitting constant sectional curvature hypersurfaces. In order to do so, we prove first that in $\mathbb S^3\times\mathbb S^3$, $\mathbb C P^3$ and $F(\mathbb C^3)$, any hypersurface with constant sectional curvature is $\eta$-quasi umbilical, where $\eta$ is the dual one-form of the Reeb vector field. Then, we use the non-existence of such hypersurfaces in these spaces. Additionally, we characterize hypersurfaces of six-dimensional nearly K\"ahler manifolds which are Sasakian, nearly Sasakian, co-K\"ahler and nearly cosymplectic.</description>

      <title>A new family of minimal surfaces of even genus in the three-dimensional sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a family of closed, embedded minimal surfaces in the three-dimensional round sphere which includes new examples with low genus. The existence proof relies on an equivariant min-max procedure applied to a novel sweepout which is constructed by fusing the equatorial sphere with the Clifford torus. We determine the full symmetry groups of our surfaces, prove lower bounds on their Morse indices, and show that they are geometrically distinct from all previously known examples.</description>

      <title>Spacelike Submanifolds of Codimension Two with Parallel Mean Curvature Vector Field in Lorentz-Minkowski Spacetime Contained in the Light Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general integral inequality is established for compact spacelike submanifolds of codimension two in the Lorentz-Minkowski spacetime under the assumption that the mean curvature vector field is parallel. This inequality is then used to derive a rigidity result. Specifically, we obtain a complete characterization of all compact spacelike submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector field that lie in the light cone of the Lorentz-Minkowski spacetime: they must be totally umbilical spheres contained in a spacelike hyperplane in Lorentz-Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Biconservative Weingarten surfaces with flat normal bundle in $N^4 (\epsilon)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our investigation of the class of biconservative surfaces with non-constant mean curvature in 4-dimensional space forms $N^4(\epsilon)$. Specifically, we focus on biconservative surfaces with non-parallel normalized mean curvature vector fields (non-PNMC) that have flat normal bundles and are Weingarten. In our initial result we obtain the compatibility conditions for this class of biconservative surfaces in terms of an ODE system. Subsequently, by prescribing the flat connection in the normal bundle, we prove an existence result for the considered class of biconservative surfaces. Furthermore, we determine all non-PNMC biconservative Weingarten surfaces with flat normal bundles that either exhibit a particular form of the shape operator in the direction of the mean curvature vector field or have constant Gaussian curvature $K = \epsilon$. Finally, we prove that such surfaces cannot be biharmonic.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$. Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band, which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$, classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$ follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for completeness.</description>

Abstract: A brief proof of Lie's classification of finite dimensional subalgebras of vector fields on the complex plane that have a proper Levi decomposition is given. The proof uses basic representation theory of sl(2, C). This, combined with \cite{ABF2} and \cite{ABF3} completes the classification of finite dimensional subalgebras of vector fields on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Real Spectrum Compactifications of Universal Geometric Spaces over Character Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct universal geometric spaces over the real spectrum compactification $\Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ of the character variety $\Xi$ of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{SL}_n$, providing geometric interpretations of boundary points. For an algebraic set $Y(\mathbb{R})$ on which $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ acts by algebraic automorphisms (such as $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$ or an algebraic cover of the symmetric space of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$), the projection map $\Xi \times Y \rightarrow \Xi$ extends to a $\Gamma$-equivariant continuous surjection $(\Xi \times Y)^{\mathrm{RSp}} \rightarrow \Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$. The fibers of this extended map are homeomorphic to the Archimedean spectrum of $Y(\mathbb{F})$ for some real closed field $\mathbb{F}$, which is a locally compact subset of $Y^{\mathrm{RSp}}$. The Archimedean spectrum is naturally homeomorphic to the real analytification, and we use this identification to compute the image of the fibers in their Berkovich analytification. For $Y=\mathbb{P}^1$, the image is a real subtree.</description>

Abstract: Extending the recent work of Cannarsa, Cheng and Fathi, we investigate topological properties of the locus ${\cal NU}(M,g)$ of multiple maximizing geodesics on a globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,g)$, i.e.\ the set of causally related pairs $(x,y)$ for which there exists more than one maximizing geodesic (up to reparametrization) from $x$ to $y$. We will prove that this set is locally contractible. We will also define the notion of a Lorentzian Aubry set ${\cal A}$ and prove that the inclusions ${\cal NU}(M,g)\hookrightarrow \operatorname{Cut}_M\hookrightarrow J^+\backslash {\cal A}$ are homotopy equivalences.</description>

Abstract: The proposals of Joyce [Joy18], and Doan and Walpuski [DW19] on counting closed associative submanifolds of $G_2$-manifolds depend on various conjectural transitions. This article contributes to the study of transitions arising from the degenerations of associative submanifolds into conically singular (CS) associative submanifolds. First, we study the moduli space of CS associative submanifolds with isolated singularities modeled on associative cones in $\mathbb R^7$, establishing transversality results in both fixed and one-parameter family of co-closed $G_2 $-structures. We prove that for a generic co-closed $G_2$-structure (or a generic path thereof) there are no CS associative submanifolds having singularities modeled on cones with stability-index greater than $0$ (or $1$, respectively). We establish that associative cones whose links are null-torsion holomorphic curves in $S^6$ have stability-index greater than $4$, and all special Lagrangian cones in $\mathbb C^3$ have stability-index greater than or equal to $1$ with equality only for the Harvey-Lawson $T^2$-cone and a transverse pair of planes. Next, we study the desingularizations of CS associative submanifolds in a one-parameter family of co-closed $G_2$-structures. Consequently, we derive desingularization results relating the above transitions for CS associative submanifolds with a Harvey-Lawson $T^2$-cone singularity and for associative submanifolds with a transverse self-intersection.</description>

      <title>Growth of spinors in the generalized Seiberg-Witten equations on $\mathbb R^4$ and $\mathbb R^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Seiberg-Witten equations in dimensions three and four admit a natural generalization within a unified framework known as the generalized Seiberg-Witten (GSW) equations, which encompasses many important equations in gauge theory. This article proves that the averaged $L^2$-norm of any spinor with non-constant pointwise norm in the GSW equations on $\mathbb R^4$ and $\mathbb R^3$, measured over large-radius spheres, grows faster than a power of the radius, under a suitable curvature decay assumption. Separately, it is shown that if the Yang-Mills-Higgs energy of any solution of these equations is finite, then the pointwise norm of the spinor in it must converge to a non-negative constant at infinity. These two behaviors cannot occur simultaneously unless the spinor has constant pointwise norm. This work may be seen as partial generalization of results obtained by Taubes[Tau17a], and Nagy and Oliveira [NO19] for the Kapustin-Witten equations.</description>

      <title>On a new definition of the B\"{a}cklund transformation in the isometric deformation of surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01135v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a generic $4$-dimensional integrable rolling distribution of contact elements with the symmetry of the tangency configuration (excluding developable seed and isotropic developable leaves) splits into an $1$-dimensional family of generic $3$-dimensional integrable rolling distributions of contact elements with the symmetry of the tangency configuration, thus introducing a new definition of the B\"{a}cklund transformation in the isometric deformation of surfaces.</description>

      <title>A partitioned manifold index theorem for noncompact hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roe's partitioned manifold index theorem applies when a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ is cut into two pieces along a compact hypersurface $N$. It states that a version of the index of a Dirac operator on $M$ localized to $N$ equals the index of the corresponding Dirac operator on $N$. This yields obstructions to positive scalar curvature, and implies cobordism invariance of the index of Dirac operators on compact manifolds. We generalize this result to cases where $N$ may be noncompact, under assumptions on the way it is embedded into $M$. This results in an equality between two classes in the $K$-theory of the Roe algebra of $N$. Bunke and Ludewig, and Engel and Wulff, have recently obtained related results based on different approaches.</description>

      <title>Orthosystoles and orthokissing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary, we study the orthosystole, i.e. the length of a shortest essential arc from the boundary to the boundary. We recover and extend work by Bavard completely characterizing the surfaces maximizing the orthosystole in the case of a single boundary component. For multiple boundary components, we construct surfaces with large orthosystole and show that their orthosystole grows, as the genus goes to infinity, at the same rate as Bavard's upper bound.</description>

      <title>K-stability of special Gushel-Mukai manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gushel-Mukai manifolds are specific families of $n$-dimensional Fano manifolds of Picard rank $1$ and index $n-2$ where $3\leq n \leq 6$. A Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is either ordinary, i.e. a hyperquadric section of a quintic Del Pezzo $(n+1)$-fold, or special, i.e. it admits a double cover over the quintic Del Pezzo $n$-fold branched along an ordinary Gushel-Mukai $(n-1)$-fold. In this paper, we prove that a general special Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is K-stable for every $3\leq n\leq 6$. Furthermore, we give a description of the first and last walls of the K-moduli of the pair $(M,cQ)$, where $M$ is the quintic Del Pezzo fourfold (or fivefold) and $Q$ is an ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefold (or fourfold). Besides, we compute $\delta$-invariants of quintic Del Pezzo fourfolds and fivefolds which were shown to be K-unstable by K. Fujita, and show that they admit K\"ahler-Ricci solitons.</description>

      <title>Metric Convolutions: A Unifying Theory to Adaptive Image Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard convolutions are prevalent in image processing and deep learning, but their fixed kernels limits adaptability. Several deformation strategies of the reference kernel grid have been proposed. Yet, they lack a unified theoretical framework. By returning to a metric perspective for images, now seen as two-dimensional manifolds equipped with notions of local and geodesic distances, either symmetric (Riemannian) or not (Finsler), we provide a unifying principle: the kernel positions are samples of unit balls of implicit metrics. With this new perspective, we also propose metric convolutions, a novel approach that samples unit balls from explicit signal-dependent metrics, providing interpretable operators with geometric regularisation. This framework, compatible with gradient-based optimisation, can directly replace existing convolutions applied to either input images or deep features of neural networks. Metric convolutions typically require fewer parameters and provide better generalisation. Our approach shows competitive performance in standard denoising and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>On the second coefficient in the semi-classical expansion of Toeplitz Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact strictly pseudoconvex embeddable CR manifold and let $A$ be the Toeplitz operator on $X$ associated with a Reeb vector field $\mathcal{T}\in\mathscr{C}^\infty(X,TX)$. Consider the operator $\chi_k(A)$ defined by functional calculus of $A$, where $\chi$ is a smooth function with compact support in the positive real line and $\chi_k(\lambda):=\chi(k^{-1}\lambda)$. It was established recently that $\chi_k(A)(x,y)$ admits a full asymptotic expansion in $k$. The second coefficient of the expansion plays an important role in the further study of CR geometry. In this work, we calculate the second coefficient of the expansion.</description>
