      <title>Measurement of $^{3,4}$He($K^-, \pi^0$)$^{3,4}_\Lambda$H reaction cross section and evaluation of hypertriton binding energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light $s$-shell hypernuclei ($^{3,4}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$) and their ground-state properties are crucial benchmarks in hypernuclear physics. In particular, comparing the production cross sections of $^{3}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ provides insights into the $\Lambda N$ interaction in different isospin configurations, which can help address recent discrepancies in the reported binding energy of hypertriton. We present the first measurement of the production cross sections for $^{3}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ using the in-flight $(K^-, \pi^0)$ reaction at a beam momentum of 1.0 GeV/$c$ with an identical experimental setup. The production cross sections in the laboratory frame, for the angular range from 0$^{\circ}$ to 20$^{\circ}$, are measured to be: $15.0~\pm~2.6~(\text{stat.})~^{+2.4}_{-2.8}~(\text{syst.})~\mu \text{b} $ and $50.7~\pm~2.1~(\text{stat.})~^{+7.8}_{-8.3}~(\text{syst.})~\mu \text{b}$, respectively.
  Using the ratio of the cross sections and comparing the ratio with theoretical calculations, we evaluate the hypertriton binding energy to be $0.061\ ^{+0.028}_{-0.022}\ (\text{stat.})\ ^{+0.024}_{-0.021}\ (\text{syst.})\ \text{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Angular Distribution of Cherenkov Radiation in Thick Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the emission of Cherenkov radiation in thick media, explore the limitations of the simulation tools currently in use in particle and nuclear physics, and propose a method for overcoming these limitations. We start with a derivation of the Cherenkov power spectrum and its angular profile, accounting for interference of the radiation emitted, in contrast with commonly used tools that assume perfect coherence. We then study the impact that the path of electrons through a medium has on the angular profile of Cherenkov light. Finally, we devise a model that can introduce these effects in Geant4 and tune it to explain calibration data from the water-phase of SNO+. We find that the tuned model significantly improves the agreement between data and simulation, so we provide it for its wider use.</description>

      <title>A high-voltage MR-ToF mass spectrometer and separator for the study of exotic isotopes at FRIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) delivers a wide variety of rare isotopes as fast, stopped, or reaccelerated beams to enable forefront research in nuclear structure, astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. To expand the scientific potential of FRIB's stopped and reaccelerated beam programs, we are designing a Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer and separator (MR-ToF MS). It will enable high-precision mass measurements of short-lived isotopes, improve beam diagnostics, and deliver isobarically and isomerically purified beams to downstream experimental stations. It is designed to store ions at a kinetic energy of 30 keV, significantly enhancing ion throughput while maintaining high mass resolving power. We present the scientific motivation, technical design, and simulations demonstrating the expected performance of the system, which has the potential to significantly enhance FRIB's mass measurement, diagnostic, and mass separation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Equation of state for hyperonic neutron-star matter in SU(3) flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to finite-nucleus observables and bulk properties of dense nuclear matter, we investigate hyperonic neutron-star matter within an SU(3) flavor-symmetry scheme. To retain SU(6)-based couplings within SU(3) flavor symmetry, we add a quartic $\phi$ self-interaction and $\phi$-$\rho$ mixing. We demonstrate the roles of $\alpha_{v}$ ($F/(F+D)$ ratio), $\theta_{v}$ (mixing angle), and $z_{v}$ (singlet-to-octet coupling ratio) in SU(3)-invariant vector-meson couplings. It is found that $z_{v}$ predominantly controls the maximum mass of a neutron star, and $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars can be supported for $z_{v}\le0.15$. The $\alpha_{v}$ also helps sustain large masses, whereas $\theta_{v}$ has a smaller effect on neutron-star properties. This SU(3) framework reconciles nuclear and astrophysical constraints, and offers a plausible resolution to the hyperon puzzle.</description>

      <title>Solution to the uncertainty problem of nuclear matrix element for neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) of nuclei is one of the major research subjects of neutrino physics nowadays because of its influence on particle physics and astrophysics. The predicted nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay have a large uncertainty depending on the models used to calculate them. This problem has affected the development of neutrino physics for many years. We have performed, recently, the calculation of the NMEs for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) modes with a perturbed transition operator and found that the effective axial-vector current coupling ($g_A^\mathrm{eff}$) is similar for these two decay modes. Based on this finding, we calculate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NMEs using the phenomenological $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ that reproduces the measured half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay. We apply this method to the NMEs for $^{136}$Xe obtained by several groups and show that the uncertainty of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is dramatically reduced. Owing to this finding, we calculate the effective neutrino mass, consistent with the current experimental lower limit of the half-life for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, and the results indicate that this effective neutrino mass value does not yet reach the inverted mass hierarchy region allowed by the neutrino oscillation data and the lightest neutrino mass assumed to be smaller than 10 meV.</description>

      <title>Facilitating neutron and energy reconstruction in neutrino events using the direction of tagged neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, accelerator neutrino experiments have had only limited success including neutrons in the neutrino event reconstruction event by event. Produced neutrons often interact in a detector leaving an energy deposition that does not correlate strongly with the kinetic energy of the neutron. This work explores the inclusion of the direction of a neutron tagged by such an energy deposition in concert with the missing transverse momentum of the reconstructed particles to determine the approximate kinetic energy of the neutron and modify the reconstruction of the energy of the incoming neutrino. The technique significantly increases the neutron kinetic energy estimation relative to one that assigns the neutron kinetic energy by enforcing transverse momentum balance alone. When included in the neutrino energy calculation, the neutrino energy resolution is improved and the reconstructed energy is distributed more symmetrically around the true value. The technique shows promise and might be used to good effect to analyze data taken with experiments able to tag neutron energy deposits with good neutron direction resolution such as the T2K near detector and the liquid argon detectors in the SBN program and DUNE.</description>

      <title>Gas-jet target with online interferometric thickness measurement for nuclear astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new jet gas target system has been developed for the Felsenkeller 5 MV underground ion accelerator for nuclear astrophysics. It provides either a 1.5$\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick cylindrical jet or a 7$\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick wall of nitrogen gas, with a surface of 10$\times$10 mm$^2$ to be seen by the ion beam. The system includes a de Laval type nozzle and altogether five pumping stages: In addition to the jet catcher and the jet chamber surrounding it, there are three stages connecting the jet to the ion accelerator. Behind the jet chamber, as seen from the ion beam, a windowless static-type gas target and, subsequently, a beam calorimeter have been installed.
  This work describes the offline tests of the gas target system prior to its installation on the beam line of the Felsenkeller accelerator. The thickness of the jet has been determined using three different methods: By computational fluid dynamics simulations, with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and by $\alpha$-energy loss using a mixed $\alpha$ source. The three methods were shown to be in agreement. For 0-6 bar inlet gas pressure, a linear relationship between inlet pressure and jet thickness has been found. Different shapes of de Laval type inlet nozzles, both circular and slit-type, have been manufactured from fused silica glass or stainless steel and tested using measurements and simulations. The power and stability of the beam calorimeter have been tested. The interferometry has been shown to work reliably and to give two-dimensional projections of the gas jet with sub-mm resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In experimental nuclear and particle physics, the extraction of high-purity samples of rare events critically depends on the efficiency and accuracy of particle identification (PID). In this work, we present a PID method applied to HADES data at the level of fully reconstructed particle track candidates. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in PID performance compared to conventional techniques, highlighting the potential of physics-informed neural networks as a powerful tool for future data analyses.</description>

      <title>Dineutron clusters in $^7$He and $^8$He structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyper-radial barrier strongly hinders formation of more than three clusters. We investigate how well the dominating cluster components in $^7$He and $^8$He, respectively can be described as $\alpha$+$n$+$^2n$ and $\alpha$+$^2n$+$^2n$, where $^2n$ is the dineutron. Effective interactions compatible with $^5$He and $^6$He are used. We vary the lesser known $n$-$^2n$ and $^2n$-$^2n$ interactions, where very small strengths are required. We provide energies, radii, and partial wave decomposition of all computed, predicted or measured, ground and resonance states. We predict substructures within each of the three-body quantum states. We also calculate the neutron-structure sensitive invariant mass spectrum of the four-nucleon system, after fast removal of the $\alpha$-particle from $^8$He. We show that all available experimental information are fairly well reproduced. Very little room is left for variation of the effective interaction parameters. Thus, the dominating features of the subsequently derived reaction and structure properties are well supported.</description>

      <title>High-precision direct decay energy measurements of the electron-capture decay of $^{97}$Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct measurement of the ground-state-to-ground-state electron-capture decay $Q$ ($Q_{\rm EC}$) value of $^{97}$Tc has been conducted employing the high resolving power phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the double Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP. The resulting $Q_{\rm EC}$ value for $^{97}$Tc is 324.82(21) keV, exhibiting a precision approximately 19 times higher than the value adopted in the newest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020) and differing by 1.2$\sigma$. Furthermore, by combining this refined $Q$ value with nuclear energy-level data for the decay-daughter $^{97}$Mo, a potential ultra-low Q-value transition, possibly of allowed type, $^{97}$Tc (9/2$^{+}$, ground state) $\rightarrow$ $^{97}$Mo$^{*}$ (320(1) keV), was evaluated for future long-term neutrino-mass determination experiments. The ground-state-to-excited-state electron-capture decay $Q$ value ($Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$) of this transition was determined to be 4.8(10) keV, confirming it to be energetically allowed with a confidence level of exceeding 4$\sigma$. The captures of electrons occupying the L and higher shells for this transition are energetically allowed, giving a value of 2.0(10) keV for the closest distance of $Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$ to the allowed binding energy of the L1 shell. To predict partial half-lives and energy-release distributions for this transition, the atomic self-consistent many-electron Dirac--Hartree--Fock--Slater method and the nuclear shell model have been employed. Dominant correction terms such as exchange and overlap corrections, as well as shake-up and shake-off effects, were included in the final results. Moreover, the normalized distribution of released energy in the electron-capture decay of $^{97}$Tc to excited states of $^{97}$Mo, is compared with that of $^{163}$Ho, which is being used for electron-neutrino-mass determination.</description>

Abstract: A direct comparison and analysis of published spectra for the 7$\alpha$ disassembly of $^{28}$Si projectiles excited in collisions with $^{12}$C at 35 MeV/u reveals significant agreement in the derived excitation energies of high excitation energy resonances observed in two different experiments, in contrast to some earlier conclusions reported in the literature. Many of the observed resonances have excitation energies consistent with those arrived at in recent theoretical investigations explicitly predicting the excitation energies and spins of toroidal nuclei. An AI-assisted application of well-established statistical filtering techniques reveals identical structures in all spectra investigated. Some additional peaks are observed. The possibility that they correspond to other favored geometries is discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
  In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
  Our result for that new physics is
  $b_F$ = -0.0002 $\pm$ 0.024 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
  consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.</description>

Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged isomeric ions in an ion-trap setup. We identify optical transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we have done a systematic study of beta decay properties such as electron spectral-shapes, shape factors, and log$ft$ values for the higher forbidden non-unique $\beta^{-}$ transitions in the mass region A=85-123. We have performed the nuclear shell model (SM) calculations to explore the sensitivity of the electron spectral-shapes for different axial-vector coupling constants $g_{A}=0.8-1.27$. The effective interactions GWBXG, G-matrix, SNET and SN100PN are used for different model spaces. In the present work, we have computed the electron spectral-shapes of $^{85}$Br, $^{87}$Rb, $^{93}$Zr, $^{97}$Zr, $^{101}$Mo, $^{115}$Cd, $^{117}$Cd, $^{119}$In, $^{123}$Sn and $^{135}$Cs by constraining the small relativistic nuclear matrix element from conserved vector-current hypothesis (CVC). We have found that the electron spectral-shapes are strongly dependent on $g_{A}$ except the second forbidden non-unique $\beta^{-}$ transition $^{93}$Zr.</description>

      <title>High-order anisotropic flow and nonlinear hydrodynamic responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02930</link>

Abstract: In this work, we study the charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ (up to $n = 12$) using high-statistics event-by-event simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ and $5.36$~TeV, employing the IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD hybrid approach. The power spectra of anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n\{2\}$ vs. $n$) are compared with the ALICE measurements from central to 50% centrality. To understand the various sources contributing to the high-order $v_n$ coefficients, we analyze the nonlinear mode coefficients for high-order anisotropic flow coefficients using different approximations and make comparisons with available measurements.</description>

      <title>Testing hydrodynamic response to initial-state geometry in Pb+$d^\uparrow$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deuterons with different polarization states have distinct shapes for their wavefunctions. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally control the initial-state collision geometry with the polarization of the light-ion targets in relativistic heavy-ion experiments. We study the charged hadron elliptic flow coefficients with respect to the polarization angle of deuterons in Pb + polarized deuteron collisions using a hydrodynamics + hadronic transport model. Hydrodynamic response to initial-state geometry predicts a distinct sign of $v_2$ correlated with the deuteron's polarization states, providing a clean test case for elucidating the collective origin in small collision systems.</description>
