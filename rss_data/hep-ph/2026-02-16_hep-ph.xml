      <title>Higgs decays to four leptons to $\mathcal{O}(1/\Lambda^4)$ in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decays $h \to \ell \bar{\ell} \left(Z \to \ell' \bar{\ell'}\right)$ and $h\to\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell\nu_{\ell'}\bar{\ell'}$ within the SMEFT framework and including effects up to $\mathcal O(1/\Lambda^4)$, where $\Lambda$ is the new physics scale suppressing higher dimensional operators. To work to this order, we must include the square of dimension-six operators and the interference of dimension-eight operators with the Standard Model. We study angular asymmetries and other differential decay observables and determine which are most sensitive to $\mathcal O(1/\Lambda^4)$ effects. While new kinematic structures arising in higher dimensional operators have the potential to induce novel angular dependency, we find this does not occur for $h\to\ell\bar{\ell}\left(Z\xrightarrow{}\ell'\bar{\ell'}\right)$. For $h \to \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell \nu_{\ell'} \bar{\ell'}$, new angular dependencies do arise at $\mathcal O(1/\Lambda^4)$, though they require a fully reconstructible (meaning we can go to the Higgs rest frame) final state. For non-reconstructible final states such as $\ell \bar{\nu}_\ell \nu_{\ell'} \bar{\ell'}$, we must study Higgs production and decay together with the appropriate observables, which we find obscures the new angular effects.</description>

      <title>Precise QCD Predictions for Hadron-in-jet Production in $e^+e^-$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of identified hadrons inside jets in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation allows for detailed studies of parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions in a clean environment. We compute hadron-in-jets production cross sections for $e^+e^- \to 2\,\mathrm{jets}$ and $e^+e^- \to 3\,\mathrm{jets}$ to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. By comparing with data from the ALEPH experiment, we demonstrate the implications of the newly computed theory predictions for precision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Precision Physics with Muons : A Decade of Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The muon has been instrumental in establishing the Standard Model of particle physics and continues to play a key role in exploring the nature of New Physics. A global program is underway to enhance the discovery potential of a wide range of muon probes, with significant increases in sensitivity anticipated over the next decade. In this review, we examine recent experimental advancements in the study of muon decays, the determination of the muon magnetic and electric dipole moments, and the search for charged lepton flavor violating transitions. We explore the implications for scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on models involving light new particles, such as axions or hidden sectors. Opportunities from novel experimental concepts and proposal for new muon facilities are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the Scalar Sector: Discovery Reach for Heavy Higgs Pairs at a $\sqrt{s} = 6$ TeV Muon Collider in the 2HDM Alignment Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive phenomenological investigation into the discovery potential of heavy Higgs boson pairs ($HH, HA, AA, H^+H^-$) at a $\sqrt{s}=6$~TeV Muon Collider. Utilizing the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I within the alignment limit ($\sin(\beta-\alpha) \approx 1$), we evaluate two primary benchmarks with degenerate scalar masses of 1000~GeV (BP1) and 2000~GeV (BP2). Theoretical calculations performed reveal that Type-I branching fractions to third-generation fermions remain uniquely independent of $\tan\beta$, providing a stable signal across the investigated parameter space. We demonstrate that the Muon Collider environment allows for the precise identification of high-multiplicity hadronic final states. A key finding of this research is that the signal processes yield distinctive topological signatures: an 8-jet state ($4j+4b$) for charged pairs and a highly complex 12-jet state ($8j+4b$) for neutral pairs ($HA/AA$). These signatures, combined with hard transverse momentum distributions and central pseudorapidity ($|\eta| \le 3$), allow for nearly absolute suppression of Standard Model backgrounds like $t\bar{t}$, $W^+W^-Z$, and $ZZZ$. At an integrated luminosity of 10~ab$^{-1}$, we report a staggering statistical significance of 104,000 for the $H^+H^-$ channel and 3343 for the $HA$ channel in the BP1 scenario. Furthermore, total selection efficiencies were found to increase from approximately 20\% at BP1 to 47\% at BP2, suggesting that the decay products of heavier scalars are kinematically easier to resolve. We conclude that a 6~TeV Muon Collider offers an unparalleled discovery reach for the extended scalar sector, providing a definitive facility for probing physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete scheme of cosmological neutrino self-interactions: Collision term for a wide range of mediator masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions (NSI) offer a potential pathway to address anomalies in standard cosmology and explain existing cosmological tensions. In this work, we present a novel framework to obtain the neutrino--neutrino collision term within the Boltzmann hierarchy, incorporating both neutrino and mediator masses as free parameters. Our calculations encompass both Dirac-like and Majorana neutrinos and distinguish between two neutrino mass eigenstates. This work provides a valuable tool for future analyses, should a NSI signal be detected. Remarkably, our results show a smooth transition from the light to the heavy mediator approximation as the Universe cools down for non-resonant cases. Thus, for the widely studied heavy mediator, our new scheme eliminates the need to approximate at high redshifts when the temperature increases above the mediator mass, and it provides the tools to test the threshold of validity of the heavy mediator paradigm. While this work focuses on NSI mediated by a scalar particle, the presented framework could be adapted to a broader range of neutrino NSI and possibly to warm dark matter self-interacting scenarios.</description>

      <title>NNLL$^\prime$ resummation of azimuthal decorrelation for boosted top quark pair production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision program of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) increasingly relies on the boosted regime, where top quark properties are probed at the TeV scale. However, the simultaneous presence of heavy quark mass effects and large logarithmic corrections from soft radiation poses a significant challenge for theoretical predictions. In this work, we develop a transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization and resummation framework for boosted top quark pair production in the back-to-back limit at the LHC. By employing a two step matching procedure, matching QCD through $\mathrm{SCET}\,+\,\mathrm{HQET}$ onto $\mathrm{SCET}\,+\,\mathrm{bHQET}$, we systematically resum large logarithms associated with both the top quark mass and the azimuthal decorrelation. A key component of our formalism is the first extraction of the two-loop ultra-collinear function, obtained via the refactorization of the fully differential massive soft function. This result completes the set of perturbative ingredients required to achieve $\mathrm{NNLL}^\prime$ accuracy for the azimuthal decorrelation distribution. Our framework establishes a new benchmark for heavy-quark TMD resummation in the boosted limit at hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Probing the isospin structure and low-lying resonances in $\Lambda_c^+ \to n\bar{K}^0 \pi^+$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-favored decay $\Lambda_c^+ \to n \bar{K}^0\pi^+$ offers a unique window to explore unresolved puzzles in the low-energy baryon spectroscopy and the isospin dynamics of the $\bar{K}N$ system. Recent experimental results present a, for now, contradiction: LHCb and Belle analyses of $\Lambda_c^+ \to p K^-\pi^+$ suggest the $pK^-$ ($I=0$) component dominates, while the BESIII hints at significant contributions from both isospin $0$ and $1$ in the $n\bar{K}^0$ system of $\Lambda_c^+ \to n K_S^0 \pi^+$. Furthermore, the measured branching fraction of $\Lambda_c^+ \to n K_S^0 \pi^+$ exceeds SU(3) symmetry predictions by a factor of 3-4, signaling strong contributions from low-lying resonances. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of $\Lambda_c^+ \to n \bar{K}^0\pi^+$ within the coupled-channel chiral unitary approach, where the $N(1535)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ can be dynamically generated. Our calculations show a narrow peak from $N(1535)$ in the $\pi^+ n$ invariant mass spectrum and a distinct dip from $\Lambda(1670)$ in the $\bar{K}^0 n$ spectrum. The dip structure is qualitatively consistent with the $\Lambda(1670)$ manifestation in $\bar{K}N \to \bar{K}N$ scattering, supporting its molecular interpretation. This study not only connects the experimental observations but also highlights $\Lambda_c^+ \to n \bar{K}^0\pi^+$ as a crucial process to disentangle the nature of $N(1535)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$. Future precise measurements of this decay channel by the BESIII, Belle II, LHCb, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Factory are strongly encouraged.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws and effective hadronization models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronization models based on local string-breaking dynamics are typically Markovian by construction, yet the physical ensemble of final states is shaped by global constraints that couple the entire fragmentation trajectory. Recasting hadronization as a conditioned stochastic diffusion process provides a precise mathematical resolution to this tension. In particular, this language reveals explicitly that constraints stemming from conservation laws induce non-Markovian correlations between otherwise independent fragmentation steps, and that these correlations can be absorbed exactly into a renormalization of the local dynamics through a Doob $h$-transform. We develop this formalism for a $q\bar{q}$ string in the chiral limit, where the longitudinal-transverse factorization of the Lund kernel becomes exact, enabling systematic power counting and clean ultraviolet (UV)/infrared (IR) separation. The dynamics organize naturally into a tower of effective theories distinguished by the remaining string mass, spanning a UV fixed point with scale-invariant transport coefficients, an intermediate regime where transverse phase space induces controlled running, and an IR boundary layer where non-local effects enter at leading order. The tower exhibits genuine Wilsonian structure, including $\beta$-functions, anomalous dimensions, and systematic matching conditions. The resulting framework achieves a clean factorization of universal microscopic fragmentation dynamics from infrared constraint effects, and opens new directions for both the theoretical analysis and practical simulation of hadronization.</description>

      <title>Resummation of threshold double logarithms in quarkonium fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for resumming threshold double logarithms that appear in fragmentation functions for production of heavy quarkonia. Threshold singularities appear in fixed-order calculations of quarkonium fragmentation functions in the nonrelativistic QCD factorization formalism due to radiation of soft gluons. Because of this, at fixed order quarkonium fragmentation functions are not positive definite, and can lead to unphysically negative cross sections. This problem can be resolved by resumming threshold logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory, which renders the fragmentation functions finite and ensures the positivity of cross sections. We present a detailed derivation of the resummation formalism and derive the formula for resummed quarkonium fragmentation functions, which can be computed entirely within perturbation theory without the need for nonperturbative model functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The top-quark threshold cross section at $e^+e^-$ colliders near production threshold is investigated. We study the scale dependence of the cross section for $\sigma(e^+e^- \to ttX$) near $\sqrt{s} \simeq 2m_t$ and discuss the theoretical accuracy of the NNNLO prediction. We report that a threshold scan at an $e^+e^-$ collider would allow a determination of the top-quark mass with an accuracy of order 30 MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of light GeV-scale heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) on Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the neutrino-extended Standard Model Effective Field Theory ($\nu$SMEFT). We show that, based on very general considerations, BBN constraints complement laboratory searches at colliders, beam dumps, and neutrinoless double beta decay, by providing an upper bound on the cut-off scale of the effective field theory for HNL masses above $\sim$100 MeV. We identify target regions for future laboratory probes of the $\nu$SMEFT parameter space that is bounded from above and below.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Structure of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian truncation for the two-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ theory within the framework of Hamiltonian truncation effective theory, where truncation artifacts are mitigated through a systematic inclusion of corrective terms organized in inverse powers of the ultraviolet energy cut-off $E_{\rm max}$. Building on the leading-order matching program, we develop two complementary extensions. First, we derive compact all-order expressions for the local matching corrections to the mass and quartic coupling by resumming infinite classes of diagrams sharing fixed topologies within the local approximation. Second, we extend the non-local sector by computing the next-to-next-to-local corrections contributing at $\mathcal{O}(E_{\rm max}^{-4})$, following a continuum-first matching procedure, in which the effective corrections are computed in infinite volume and the spatial direction is subsequently re-compactified to obtain a separable Hilbert-space basis on which the truncated operator construction is implemented. Our results show that an increasingly rich operator basis is necessary to describe the theory beyond leading order.</description>

      <title>Rotating Synchrotron Radiation (RoSyRa): photon emission from magnetized and rotating quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the production of non-prompt photons originating from rotating synchrotron radiation (RoSyRa), specifically the emission of photons by a rigidly rotating quark-gluon plasma in thermal equilibrium, in the presence of an external magnetic field. We compute the non-prompt photon spectrum and its elliptic flow ($v_2$) at mid-rapidity. In particular, we investigate the finite volume effects. We find that at low transverse momentum, the magnetic field induces a significant $v_2$, while the plasma rotation boosts the synchrotron radiation of negatively charged quarks. These effects account for both the observed excess of direct photons and their elliptic flow, contributing to the resolution of the "direct photon puzzle".</description>

      <title>Constraining ALP-Meson overlaps from $K\pi$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on the overlaps between an Axion-like particle (ALP) and the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons from the analysis of the distortions to the $\langle K|\overline{s}\gamma^\mu u | \pi\rangle$ form factors. We demonstrate that these distortions can be tightly constrained by combining data from $\tau^-\to \pi^0 K^-\nu$ and $K^+\to \pi^0\ell^+\nu$ decays, and go on to map the constraints to the ALP-meson overlaps. We establish that, in general, the ALP-meson and meson-ALP overlaps are different due to the presence of ALP-quark derivative couplings in the UV Lagrangian, and need to be treated separately. Using lattice results and BaBar, Belle, and NA48/2 data, we obtain exclusion limits on the overlaps and give projections for Belle II. Our techniques are independent of the branching ratios of the ALP, hence, robust against ALP decay channel assumptions. For masses of the ALP below 1 GeV, the bounds on the effective scale of the ALP physics extend to $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) for restricted regions of the parameter space for the ALP-$\pi$ and $\pi$-ALP overlaps. On the other hand, these bounds persist for extended regions of the parameter space for ALP-$\eta$ and $\eta$-ALP overlaps.</description>

      <title>Profiling systematic uncertainties in Simulation-Based Inference with Factorizable Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unbinned likelihood fits aim at maximizing the information one can extract from experimental data, yet their application in realistic statistical analyses is often hindered by the computational cost of profiling systematic uncertainties. Additionally, current machine learning-based inference methods are typically limited to estimating scalar parameters in a multidimensional space rather than full differential distributions. We propose a general framework for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate Distributions of Interest (DoI), defined as learnable invertible transformations of the feature space. We introduce Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, preserving tractability without combinatorial explosion. Crucially, we develop an amortized training strategy that learns the conditional dependence of the DoI on nuisance parameters in a single optimization process, bypassing the need for repetitive training during the likelihood scan. This allows for the simultaneous extraction of the underlying distribution and the robust profiling of nuisances. The method is validated on a synthetic dataset emulating a high-energy physics measurement with multiple systematic sources, demonstrating its potential for unbinned, functional measurements in complex analyses.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Hubble tension with Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates is a keV scale sterile neutrino. In the early universe the observed relic of the sterile neutrino DM is generated via the \textit{Dodelson-Widrow} mechanism. However, this production scenario is severely constraint by various astrophysical observations. Many non-standard interactions between active ($\nu_a$) and sterile ($\nu_s$) neutrino have been proposed to evade these astrophysical bounds. Here, we study sterile neutrino in the context of a mass-varying scenario by coupling both active and sterile neutrino to a scalar field. This novel mechanism opens up a new parameter space that generates the observed DM relic and alleviates the \textit{Hubble tension}. We find that the resulting parameter space can be fully probed by future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Gapped States and Symmetry-Enforced Gaplessness in 3-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Lazarides-Shafi axion models as Dijkgraaf-Witten theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion models often face the domain wall problem, which threatens the standard big-bang cosmology. The Lazarides-Shafi mechanism attempts to resolve this by identifying degenerate vacua through a continuous gauge symmetry. We formulate a topological quantum field theory to isolate the essential structure of the mechanism and analyze its generalized symmetry structure, including higher-form symmetries and higher-group. This framework yields a master formula for computing the domain wall number and clarifies the higher-form symmetry conditions required for complete vacuum identification in a model independent way. Moreover, while a domain-wall-number-one scenario eliminates all higher-form global symmetries, the theory nevertheless exhibits a nontrivial four-group structure and realizes a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase.</description>

      <title>IAFormer: Interaction-Aware Transformer network for collider data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \texttt{IAFormer}, a novel Transformer-based architecture that efficiently integrates pairwise particle interactions through a dynamic sparse attention mechanism. \texttt{IAFormer} has two new mechanisms within the model. First, the attention matrix depends on predefined boost invariant pairwise quantities, reducing the network parameters significantly from the original particle transformer models. Second, \texttt{IAFormer} incorporates the sparse attention mechanism by utilizing the "differential attention", so that it can dynamically prioritize relevant particle tokens while reducing computational overhead associated with less informative ones. This approach significantly lowers the model complexity without compromising performance. Despite being computationally efficient by more than an order of magnitude than the Particle Transformer network, \texttt{IAFormer} achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification tasks on the top and quark-gluon datasets. Furthermore, we employ AI interpretability techniques, verifying that the model effectively captures physically meaningful information layer by layer through its sparse attention mechanism, building an efficient network output that is resistant to statistical fluctuations. \texttt{IAFormer} highlights the need for sparse attention in Transformer analysis to reduce the network size while improving its performance.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytical solution for the evolution of parton distributions incorporating mixed-order QCD $\otimes$ QED corrections, addressing both polarized and unpolarized cases. Using the Altarelli-Parisi kernels extended to mixed order, we solve the DGLAP equations exactly in Mellin $N$-space and derive the associated Wilson coefficients for the polarized structure function $g_1$. Our analytical approach improves computational efficiency and enhances the precision of theoretical predictions in observables sensitive to QED corrections, with relevance for current and future phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Natural neutrino mass hierarchy in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy with large lepton mixing angles may be achieved in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction. Hitherto it has been shown that neutrino anarchy may result from such theories, but here we show that this need not necessarily be the case. In particular we consider the minimal tri-hypercharge theory, and show that the decomposition of the family hypercharges into the corresponding $B-L$ gauge groups, together with the charged lepton mass hierarchy, implies the sequential dominance conditions for a neutrino mass hierarchy, where lepton mixing originates from both the neutrino and charged lepton sectors. We present novel and model-independent sequential dominance results applicable to this case, but also useful more generally. We also show how natural quark mass and mixing are included in such a framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic functional approach to calculating symmetry-restoring counterterms in Effective Field Theories (EFTs) regulated using the Breitenlohner--Maison--'t Hooft--Veltman (BMHV) scheme. Building on a recently developed method that employs auxiliary spurion fields, our approach automates the extraction of these counterterms directly from the one-loop effective action, offering a streamlined and efficient procedure. We demonstrate its efficacy by applying it to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) at dimension six, providing the first complete determination of its symmetry-restoring counterterms in the BMHV scheme. Our work establishes a robust foundation for consistent one-loop matching and two-loop running computations in EFTs with chiral gauge symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Neutrinos from Stored Muons (nuSTORM) facility will generate neutrino beams from both muon and meson decays in a storage ring, providing a neutrino flux known to the percent level. This unprecedented precision enables a rich physics programme, including high-precision tests of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. In this paper we demonstrate nuSTORM's sensitivity to key Standard Model processes such as, measurements of the weak mixing angle at low $Q^2$ and the rare process of neutrino trident production. We also show its powerful reach for a diverse range of beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios, including eV-scale sterile neutrinos, Kaluza-Klein excitations from large extra dimensions and lepton flavour violation. Furthermore, nuSTORM can place significant constraints on heavy QCD axions and other axion-like particles produced in rare kaon decays. These capabilities establish nuSTORM as a powerful and complementary probe to long baseline experiments and collider searches.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of confining strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological determinations of the number of relativistic neutrino species, $N^{ }_{\rm eff}$, are becoming increasingly accurate, and further improvements are expected both from CMB and BBN data. Given this context, we update the evaluation of $N^{ }_{\rm eff}$ and the current entropy density via the momentum-averaged approach. This allows for a numerically fast description of neutrino decoupling, easily portable to an array of new physics scenarios. We revisit all aspects of this approach, including collision terms with full electron mass dependence, finite temperature QED corrections to the equation of state, neutrino oscillations, and the modelling of neutrino ensembles with effective chemical potentials. For integrated observables, our results differ by less than $0.04\%$ from the solution of the momentum-dependent evolution equation. We outline how to extend the approach to BSM settings, and will highlight its power in Part II. To facilitate the practical implementation, we release a Mathematica and Python code within nudec_BSM_v2, easily linkable to BBN codes.</description>

Abstract: We combine existing perturbative results to show that a precise analytic determination of the charm-quark contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) part of the muon anomalous magnetic moment is possible. Working in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme, we include the NLO $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ correction, which significantly reduces the residual renormalization-scale dependence and the perturbative uncertainty. Our final result is $a_{\mu}^{\mathrm{HLbLc}}=3.65(25)\times 10^{-11}$, in good agreement with recent lattice determinations.</description>

      <title>Light Vector Dark Matter via a Magnetic Dipole Portal: Bridging Direct Detection and Fixed-Target Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model featuring sub-GeV vector dark matter by augmenting the Standard Model with a new non-Abelian dark $SU(2)_D$, spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values of a scalar doublet and a triplet. Interactions between the dark and visible sectors arise through a dimension-5 non-Abelian \textit{avatar} of kinetic mixing portal, inducing effective magnetic dipole couplings of the dark matter, with the photon and Z boson. The resulting spectrum of the dark gauge bosons naturally exhibits an inverse mass hierarchy between the dark matter and the $Z^\prime$, leading to interesting phenomenology at fixed-target experiments such as LDMX through dark off-shell bremsstrahlung, dark Higgs-strahlung, invisible vector meson decay, and visible decays. We compute the thermal relic abundance across sub-GeV dark matter masses, with regions of freeze-out proceeding via forbidden annihilation into dark sector states or direct annihilation into Standard Model states. Bounds from a broad set of laboratory probes, along with cosmological and astrophysical observations, are incorporated in our analysis. Among them, the most restrictive bounds originate from direct detection experiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, collider searches, and the CMB. Our results demonstrate that a sizeable region of parameter space remains consistent with the observed relic abundance and current experimental constraints, and that fixed-target searches should be considered in tandem with direct detection and cosmological probes for an effective and comprehensive search strategy, especially in the off-shell regime.</description>

      <title>Linear realization of SU(3) parity doublet model for octet baryons with bad diquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a linear $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ parity doublet model for octet baryons. Our model employs the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ and $(3,6) + (6,3)$ chiral representations while excluding the $(8,1) + (1,8)$ representation. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $\Sigma$$\Xi$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $\Xi$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $\Xi(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Massive tree-level splitting functions beyond kinematical limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a compact form of the massive $1\to 3$ tree-level QCD splitting functions and discuss a decomposition of the results in terms of lower-order expressions, scalar dipole antenna functions and pure higher-order remainders. The two-gluon radiator functions introduced in this context are novel and generalize expressions obtained from the double-soft approximation. Our results are obtained without reference to soft or quasi-collinear limits.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Contour Deformations with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of contour deformation for the numerical evaluation of Feynman integrals after sector decomposition. In existing codes, the contour of integration is determined heuristically for each phase-space point by sampling the integrand. In this work, we introduce a method for choosing the contour deformation for an entire phase-space region using only an initial sampling or training step. We demonstrate that the resulting integrand has a lower variance than that obtained with heuristic methods and show that optimising a contour to reduce the estimated error of a Quasi-Monte Carlo sample is an ill-defined problem. The a priori knowledge of the integration path obtained in this work can be used to improve the speed of conventional integration methods or be leveraged for integration using neural networks, where, crucially, it removes the need to retrain the neural network for each phase-space point. The techniques described in this work can be adapted to other problems where a non-trivial integration path has to be chosen subject to a set of constraints.</description>

      <title>No evidence for p- or d-wave dark matter annihilation from local large-scale structure</title>

Abstract: If dark matter annihilates into standard model particles with a cross-section which is velocity dependent, then Local Group dwarf galaxies will not be the best place to search for the resulting gamma ray emission. A greater flux would be produced by more distant and massive halos, with larger velocity dispersions. We construct full-sky predictions for the gamma-ray emission from galaxy- and cluster-mass halos within $\sim 200 {\rm \, Mpc}$ using a suite of constrained $N$-body simulations ($\texttt{CSiBORG}$) based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies algorithm. Comparing to observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope and marginalising over reconstruction uncertainties and other astrophysical contributions to the flux, we obtain constraints on the cross-section which are two (seven) orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from dwarf spheroidals for $p$-wave ($d$-wave) annihilation. We find no evidence for either type of annihilation from dark matter particles with masses in the range $m_\chi = 2-500{\rm \, GeV}/c^2$, for any channel. As an example, for annihilations producing bottom quarks with $m_\chi = 10 {\rm \, GeV}/c^2$, we find $a_{1} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-21} {\rm \, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ and $a_{2} &lt; 3.0 \times 10^{-18} {\rm \, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ at 95% confidence, where the product of the cross-section, $\sigma$, and relative particle velocity, $v$, is given by $\sigma v = a_\ell (v/c)^{2\ell}$ and $\ell=1, 2$ for $p$-, $d$-wave annihilation, respectively. Our bounds, although failing to exclude the thermal relic cross-section for velocity-dependent annihilation channels, are among the tightest to date.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological principle on gigaparsec scales</title>

Abstract: Recent observational analyses have suggested possible evidence of hemisphere asymmetry in cosmological datasets. Parameterizations of this kind place observers in a privileged position-specifically on the plane that divides the two hemispheres. To quantify potential deviations from the cosmological principle without presuming a special location, we develop a stochastic framework that parametrizes departures from statistical homogeneity and isotropy. The near-uniform temperature of the cosmic microwave background indicates that anisotropy is negligible (at the $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface. This serves as a zero boundary condition, enabling the construction of an orthogonal basis of functions below the recombination redshift. Within this basis, we expand the relative deviation from the Hubble diagram of isotropic models (such as $\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) in a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Applying this approach, we test the cosmological principle using Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing time delays, and gravitational-wave standard sirens. For the class of large-scale anisotropies and low-order radial variations described by this framework, the current datasets are found to be consistent with statistical homogeneity and isotropy on gigaparsec scales.</description>

      <title>The Preheating Stage on The Starobinsky Inflation after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation model and its reheating features in light of the recent ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model consistent with the ACT data at the $68\%$ confidence level, the number of e-folds must increase while the reheating temperature decreases. We find that the Starobinsky model requires a spectator field to achieve efficient preheating. The preheating stage and the reheating temperature must be significantly adjusted to accommodate the lower temperature. In this paper, the favored non-minimal coupling of the produced particles is approximately $10$ or slightly lower. We also present viable parameter sets that fit the preferred reheating mechanism in this model. For certain parameter choices, the daughter fields could potentially be detected in future collider experiments such as the LHC or the ILC. Furthermore, our proposed mechanism can reproduce the lower reheating temperature, but it fails when the temperature falls below $1$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from First-Order Phase Transitions Assisted by Temperature-Enhanced Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature decreases, known as temperature - enhanced scatterings, can have a significant impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. We show that such effects naturally manifest as finite-temperature self-energy corrections to the scalar mass term, leading to an additional contribution of the form \(c\,T^{p}\phi^{2}\) in the effective potential. In this work, we systematically investigate how these loop-induced, temperature-dependent corrections affect key phase transition parameters, including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates that finite-temperature scattering effects of this kind can substantially strengthen first-order transitions and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future observational facilities. The results establish a concrete thermal-field-theoretic origin for temperature-dependent modifications of the scalar potential and emphasize their importance in shaping early-Universe cosmological signatures.</description>
