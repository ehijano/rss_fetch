      <title>On distance-regular Cayley graphs over abelian groups of rank $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2007, Miklavi\v{c} and Poto\v{c}nik proposed the problem of characterizing distance-regular Cayley graphs over specified groups, which can be viewed as a natural extension of the problem of characterizing strongly regular Cayley graphs, or equivalently, regular partial difference sets. In this paper, we consider the Miklavi\v{c}-Poto\v{c}nik problem for abelian groups of rank $2$. More specifically, we determine all distance-regular Cayley graphs over the group $\mathbb{Z}_n\oplus \mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Our proof use some new tools such as polynomial addition set, Desarguesian affine plane, and duality of Schur rings over abelian groups.</description>

      <title>On $3$-graphs with vanishing codegree Tur\'{a}n density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $k$-uniform hypergraph (or simply $k$-graph) $F$, the codegree Tur\'{a}n density $\pi_{\mathrm{co}}(F)$ is the supremum over all $\alpha$ such that there exist arbitrarily large $n$-vertex $F$-free $k$-graphs $H$ in which every $(k-1)$-subset of $V(H)$ is contained in at least $\alpha n$ edges. Recently, it was proved that for every $3$-graph $F$, $\pi_{\mathrm{co}}(F)=0$ implies $\pi_{\therefore}(F)=0$, where $\pi_{\therefore}(F)$ is the uniform Tur\'{a}n density of $F$ and is defined as the supremum over all $d$ such that there are infinitely many $F$-free $k$-graphs $H$ satisfying that any induced linear-size subhypergraph of $H$ has edge density at least $d$.
  In this paper, we introduce a layered structure for $3$-graphs which allows us to obtain the reverse implication: every layered $3$-graph $F$ with $\pi_{\therefore}(F)=0$ satisfies $\pi_{\mathrm{co}}(F)=0$. Along the way, we answer in the negative a question of Falgas-Ravry, Pikhurko, Vaughan and Volec [J. London Math. Soc., 2023] about whether $\pi_{\therefore}(F)\leq\pi_{\mathrm{co}}(F)$ always holds. In particular, we construct counterexamples $F$ with positive but arbitrarily small $\pi_{\mathrm{co}}(F)$ while having $\pi_{\therefore}(F)\ge 4/27$.</description>

      <title>Intersections of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study simplicial complexes (hypergraphs closed under taking subsets) that are the intersection of a given number k of matroids. We prove bounds on their chromatic numbers (the minimum number of edges required to cover the ground set) and their list chromatic numbers. Settling a conjecture of Kiraly and Berczi et. al., we prove that the list chromatic number is at most k times the chromatic number. Following the footsteps of Edmonds, who considered the case k=2, we study three polytopes associated with k-tuples of matroids, and prove bounds on the distances between them. The tools used are in part topological.</description>

      <title>The list chromatic number of the intersection of two generalized partition matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous theorem of Galvin states that the list chromatic number of the intersection of two partition matroids equals its chromatic number. Kiraly and Berczi et. al. conjectured that this equality holds for any two matroids. We prove this conjecture and a conjecture by Aharoni--Berger for any two generalized partition matroids.</description>

      <title>Matching polytopes, Gorensteinness, and the integer decomposition property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matching polytope of a graph $G$ is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the matchings on $G$. We characterize the graphs whose associated matching polytopes are Gorenstein, and then prove that all Gorenstein matching polytopes possess the integer decomposition property. As a special case study, we examine the matching polytopes of wheel graphs and show that they are not Gorenstein, but do possess the integer decomposition property.</description>

      <title>Ollivier-Ricci curvature of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature in terms of graph parameters and an optimal assignment. Utilizing these precise expressions, we examine the relationship between the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the 0-Ollivier-Ricci curvature, resulting in an equality condition on regular graphs. This condition allows us to characterize edges that are bone idle in regular graphs of girth four and to construct a family of bone idle graphs with this girth. We then use our formulas to provide an efficient implementation of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on regular graphs, enabling us to identify all bone idle, regular graphs with fewer than 15 vertices. Moreover, we establish a rigidity theorem for cocktail party graphs, proving that a regular graph is a cocktail party graph if and only if its Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to one. We conclude this work by presenting a condition on the degree of a regular graph that guarantees positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>The $1$-nearly edge independence number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V(G), E(G))$ be a graph. The maximum cardinality of a set $M_k \subseteq E(G)$ such that $M_k$ contains exactly $k$-pairs of adjacent edges of $G$ is called the $k$-nearly edge independence number of $G$, and is denoted by $\alpha'_k(G)$. In this paper we study $\alpha_1'(G)$. In particular, we prove a tight lower (resp. upper) bound on $\alpha_1(G)$ if $G$ is a graph with given number of vertices. Furthermore, we present a characterisation of the general (resp. connected) graphs with given number of vertices and smallest $1$-nearly edge independence number. Lastly, we pose an open problem for further exploration of this study.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable patterns in $2$-colorings of the complete bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the colored patterns that appear in any $2$-edge coloring of $K_{n,n}$, with $n$ large enough and with sufficient edges in each color. We prove the existence of a positive integer $z_2$ such that any $2$-edge coloring of $K_{n,n}$ with at least $z_2$ edges in each color contains at least one of these patterns. We give a general upper bound for $z_2$ and prove its tightness for some cases. We define the concepts of bipartite $r$-tonality and bipartite omnitonality using the complete bipartite graph as a base graph. We provide a characterization for bipartite $r$-tonal graphs and prove that every tree is bipartite omnitonal. Finally, we define the bipartite balancing number and provide the exact bipartite balancing number for paths and stars.</description>

      <title>Tree Independence Number IV. Even-hole-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the tree independence number of every even-hole-free graph is at most polylogarithmic in its number of vertices. More explicitly, we prove that there exists a constant c&gt;0 such that for every integer n&gt;1 every n-vertex even-hole-free graph has a tree decomposition where each bag has stability (independence) number at most c log^10 n. This implies that the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, as well as several other natural algorithmic problems that are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is even-hole-free.</description>

      <title>The Most Malicious Ma\^{i}tre D'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of the malicious ma\^{i}tre d' is introduced and solved by Peter Winkler in his book Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur's Collection [1]. This problem is about a ma\^{i}tre d' seating diners around a table, trying to maximize the number of diners who don't get napkins. Along with this problem, Winkler introduces a variation called the adaptive ma\^{i}tre d' and presents a strategy. This problem was later investigated and a better strategy was discovered by Acton et al. [2]. We describe an even better strategy which we call ``long trap setting" and prove that it is optimal. We also derive a formula for the expected number of napkinless diners under our optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound on the number of $1$-nearly independent vertex subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a graph with set of vertices $V(G)$ and set of edges $E(G)$. For $k\ge 0$ an integer, a subset $I_k$ of $V(G)$ is called a $k$-nearly independent vertex subset of $G$ if $I_k$ induces a subgraph of size $k$ in $G$. The number of such subsets in $G$ is denoted by $\sigma_k(G)$. In this paper we continue the study of $\sigma_1$. In particular, we prove the lower bound on $\sigma_1$ for a connected graph that contains a cycle and also characterise the two extremal graphs. This improves the result obtained in [E. O. D. Andriantiana and Z. B. Shozi. The number of 1-nearly independent vertex subsets. \textit{Quaestiones Mathematicae}, accepted].</description>

      <title>Resistance, oddness and colouring defect of snarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a bridgeless cubic graph. The \textit{resistance} of $G$, denoted $r(G)$, is the minimum number of edges which can be removed from $G$ in order to render 3-edge-colourability. The \textit{oddness} of $G$, denoted $\omega(G)$, is the minimum number of odd components in a 2-factor of $G$. The \textit{colouring defect} of $G$ (or simply, the \textit{defect} of $G$), denoted $\mu_3(G)$, is the minimum number of edges not contained in any set of three perfect matchings of $G$. These three parameters are regarded as measurements of uncolourability of snarks, partly because any one of these parameters equal zero if and only if $G$ is 3-edge-colourable. It is also known that $r(G) \geq \omega(G)$ and that $\mu_3(G) \geq \frac{3}{2}\omega(G)$ \cite{fiol,jinsteffen}. We have shown that the ratio of oddness to resistance can be arbitrarily large for non-trivial snarks \cite{allie1}. It has also been shown that the ratio of the defect to oddness can be arbitrarily large for non-trivial snarks, although this result was only shown for graphs with oddness equal to 2 \cite{karabasetal}. In the same paper, the question was posed whether there exists non-trivial snarks for given resistance $r$ or given oddness $\omega$, and arbitrarily large defect. In this paper, we prove a stronger result: For any positive integers $r \geq 2$, even $\omega \geq r$, and $d \geq \frac{3}{2}\omega$, there exists a non-trivial snark $G$ with $r(G)=r$, $\omega(G)=\omega$ and $\mu_3(G) \geq d$.</description>

      <title>Coloring the intersection of two matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result \cite{matcomp} from 2006 of Aharoni and the first author of this paper states that for any two natural numbers p, q, where p divides q, if a matroid M is p-colorable and a matroid N is q-colorable then M \cap N is (p+q)-colorable. In this paper we show that the assumption that p divides q is in fact redundant, and we also prove that M \cap N is even p+q list-colorable.
  The result uses topology and relies on a new parameter yielding a lower bound for the topological connectivity of the intersection of two matroids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetry groups and winding numbers of planar curves obtained by taking the image of the complex unit circle under a Laurent polynomial, a class that includes weighted sums of exponentials. We generalize various results on such sums of exponentials and relate them to other classes of curves present in the literature. Moreover, we consider the evolution under the wave equation of such curves for the case of binomials. Interestingly, our methods provide a unified and systematic way of constructing curves with prescribed properties, such as number of cusps, number of intersection points or winding number.</description>

      <title>$k$-Coalitions in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and investigate the concept of $k$-coalitions in graphs, where $k\ge 1$ is an integer. A $k$-coalition refers to a pair of disjoint vertex sets that jointly constitute a $k$-dominating set of the graph, meaning that every vertex not in the set has at least $k$ neighbors in the set. We define a $k$-coalition partition of a graph as a vertex partition in which each set is either a $k$-dominating set with exactly $k$ members or forms a $k$-coalition with another set in the partition. The maximum number of sets in a $k$-coalition partition is called the $k$-coalition number of the graph represented by $C_k(G)$. We present fundamental findings regarding the properties of $k$-coalitions and their connections with other graph parameters. We obtain the exact values of $2$-coalition number of some specific graphs and also study graphs with large $2$-coalition number.</description>

      <title>A short proof of the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a multigraph $G$, $\chi'(G)$ denotes the chromatic index of $G$, $\Delta(G)$ the maximum degree of $G$, and $\Gamma(G) = \max\left\{\left\lceil \frac{2|E(H)|}{|V(H)|-1} \right\rceil: H \subseteq G \text{ and } |V(H)| \text{ odd}\right\}$. As a generalization of Vizing's classical coloring result for simple graphs, the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture, posed in the 1970s, states that $\chi'(G)=\max\{\Delta(G), \Gamma(G)\}$ or $\chi'(G)=\max\{\Delta(G) + 1, \Gamma(G)\}$. Hochbaum, Nishizeki, and Shmoys further conjectured in 1986 that such a coloring can be found in polynomial time. A long proof of the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture was announced in 2019 by Chen, Jing, and Zang, and one case in that proof was eliminated recently by Jing (but the proof is still long); and neither proof has been verified. In this paper, we give a proof of the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture that is significantly shorter and confirm the Hochbaum-Nishizeki-Shmoys conjecture by providing an $O(|V|^5|E|^3)$ time algorithm for finding a $\max\{\Delta(G) + 1, \Gamma(G)\}$-edge-coloring of $G$.</description>

Abstract: We classify all the maximal linklessly embeddable graphs of order 12 and show that their complements are all intrinsically knotted. We derive results about the connected domination numbers of a graph and its complement. We provide an answer to an open question about the minimal order of a 3-non-compliant graph. We prove that the complements of knotlessly embeddable graphs of order at least 15 are all intrinsically knotted. We provide results on general $k$-non-compliant graphs and leave a set of open questions for further exploration of the subject.</description>

      <title>Integer programs with nearly totally unimodular matrices: the cographic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a notorious open question whether integer programs (IPs), with an integer coefficient matrix $M$ whose subdeterminants are all bounded by a constant $\Delta$ in absolute value, can be solved in polynomial time. We answer this question in the affirmative if we further require that, by removing a constant number of rows and columns from $M$, one obtains a submatrix $A$ that is the transpose of a network matrix.
  Our approach focuses on the case where $A$ arises from $M$ after removing $k$ rows only, where $k$ is a constant. We achieve our result in two main steps, the first related to the theory of IPs and the second related to graph minor theory.
  First, we derive a strong proximity result for the case where $A$ is a general totally unimodular matrix: Given an optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation, an optimal solution to the IP can be obtained by finding a constant number of augmentations by circuits of $[A\; I]$.
  Second, for the case where $A$ is transpose of a network matrix, we reformulate the problem as a maximum constrained integer potential problem on a graph $G$. We observe that if $G$ is $2$-connected, then it has no rooted $K_{2,t}$-minor for $t = \Omega(k \Delta)$. We leverage this to obtain a tree-decomposition of $G$ into highly structured graphs for which we can solve the problem locally. This allows us to solve the global problem via dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of theta functions as Traces of Partition Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his ``lost notebook'', Ramanujan used iterated derivatives of two theta functions to define sequences of $q$-series $\{U_{2t}(q)\}$ and $\{V_{2t}(q)\}$ that he claimed to be quasimodular. We give the first explicit proof of this claim by expressing them in terms of ``partition Eisenstein series'', extensions of the classical Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, n^{m_n}) \vdash n \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ E_{\lambda}(q):= E_2(q)^{m_1} E_4(q)^{m_2}\cdots E_{2n}(q)^{m_n}. $$ For functions $\phi : \mathcal{P}\mapsto \C$ on partitions, the {\it weight $2n$ partition Eisenstein trace} is $$ \Tr_n(\phi;q):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \phi(\lambda)E_{\lambda}(q). $$ For all $t$, we prove that $U_{2t}(q)=\Tr_t(\phi_u;q)$ and $V_{2t}(q)=\Tr_t(\phi_v;q),$ where $\phi_u$ and $\phi_v$ are natural partition weights, giving the first explicit quasimodular formulas for these series.</description>

      <title>Positivity of the symmetric group characters is as hard as the polynomial time hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that deciding the vanishing of the character of the symmetric group is $C_=P$-complete. We use this hardness result to prove that the the square of the character is not contained in $\#P$, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. This rules out the existence of any (unsigned) combinatorial description for the square of the characters. As a byproduct of our proof we conclude that deciding positivity of the character is $PP$-complete under many-one reductions, and hence $PH$-hard under Turing-reductions.</description>

Abstract: For positive integers $m$ and $n$, the Zarankiewicz number $Z_{2,2}(m,n)$ can be defined as the maximum total degree of a linear hypergraph with $m$ vertices and $n$ edges. Guy determined $Z_{2,2}(m,n)$ for all $n \geq \binom{m}{2}/3+O(m)$. Here, we extend this by determining $Z_{2,2}(m,n)$ for all $n \geq \binom{m}{2}/3$ and, when $m$ is large, for all $n \geq \binom{m}{2}/6+O(m)$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a pseudotree from the distance matrix of its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04039v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a connected graph $G$ is said to be a boundary vertex of $G$ if for some other vertex $u$ of $G$, no neighbor of $v$ is further away from $u$ than $v$. The boundary $\partial(G)$ of $G$ is the set of all of its boundary vertices.
  The boundary distance matrix $\hat{D}_G$ of a graph $G=([n],E)$ is the square matrix of order $\kappa$, being $\kappa$ the order of $\partial(G)$, such that for every $i,j\in \partial(G)$, $[\hat{D}_G]_{ij}=d_G(i,j)$.
  Given a square matrix $\hat{B}$ of order $\kappa$, we prove under which conditions $\hat{B}$ is the distance matrix $\hat{D}_T$ of the set of leaves of a tree $T$, which is precisely its boundary.
  We show that if $G$ is either a block graph or a unicyclic graph, then $G$ is uniquely determined by the boundary distance matrix $\hat{D}_{G}$ of $G$ and we also conjecture that this statement holds for every connected graph $G$, whenever both the order $n$ and the boundary (and thus also the boundary distance matrix) of $G$ are prefixed.
  Moreover, an algorithm for reconstructing a 1-block graph (resp., a unicyclic graph) from its boundary distance matrix is given, whose time complexity in the worst case is $O(\kappa n)$ (resp., $O(n^2)$).</description>

      <title>Extremes of generalized inversions on permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical inversion statistic on symmetric groups is the sum of all indicators $\textbf{1}\{\pi(i) &gt; \pi(j)\}$ for a random permutation $\pi = (\pi(1), \ldots, \pi(n))$ and the pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n$. The descent statistic counts all $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ with $\pi(i) &gt; \pi(i+1)$. The number of inversions can be generalized by restricting the indicators to pairs $(i,j)$ with $i&lt;j$ and $|i-j| \leq d$ for some $d \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$. Likewise, the number of descents can be generalized by counting all $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-d\}$ with $\pi(i) &gt; \pi(i+d)$. These generalized statistics can be further extended to the signed and even-signed permutation groups. The bandwidth index $d$ can be chosen in dependence of $n$, and the magnitude of $d$ is significant for asymptotic considerations. It is known that each of these statistics is asymptotically normal for suitable choices of $d$. In this paper we prove the bivariate asymptotic normality and determine the extreme value asymptotics of generalized inversions and descents.</description>

      <title>Genetic algorithm and edge-colorings of complete graphs with connected classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the Rank Genetic Algorithm (Rank GA) was adapted to address a problem in the field of Chromatic Graph Theory: the connected pseudo-pseudoachromatic index. We successfully improved several previously known lower bounds of that index. To validate the effectiveness of these new bounds, we performed an analytical approximation, confirming their validity. The findings highlight the interdisciplinary impact of the use of genetic algorithms in theoretical mathematical research, particularly in the solution of complex combinatorial problems. Our work demonstrates that computational methods can solve problems that are intractable to humans, leading to scientific advances in many areas. Moreover, the problem we addressed showcases the robustness of the Rank GA in finding optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame, as it consistently avoids getting stuck in local optima.</description>

Abstract: Given two discrete Morse functions on a simplicial complex, we introduce the {\em connectedness homomorphism} between the corresponding discrete Morse complexes. This concept leads to a novel framework for studying the connectedness in discrete Morse theory at the chain complex level. In particular, we apply it to describe a discrete analogy to `cusp-degeneration' of Morse complexes. A precise comparison between smooth case and our discrete cases is also given.</description>

      <title>Exploring Algorithmic Solutions for the Independent Roman Domination Problem in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a function $f:V\to \{0,1,2\}$ is said to be a \emph{Roman Dominating function} if for every $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$, there exists a vertex $u\in N(v)$ such that $f(u)=2$. A Roman Dominating function $f$ is said to be an \emph{Independent Roman Dominating function} (or IRDF), if $V_1\cup V_2$ forms an independent set, where $V_i=\{v\in V~\vert~f(v)=i\}$, for $i\in \{0,1,2\}$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\sum_{v\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The \emph{Independent Roman Domination Number} of $G$, denoted by $i_R(G)$, is defined as min$\{w(f)~\vert~f$ is an IRDF of $G\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of computing $i_R(G)$ is defined as the \emph{Minimum Independent Roman Domination problem}. The problem is already known to be NP-hard for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we further study the algorithmic complexity of the problem.
  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the Minimum Independent Roman Domination problem for distance-hereditary graphs, split graphs, and $P_4$-sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>The first Steklov eigenvalue of planar graphs and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Steklov eigenvalue problem was introduced over a century ago, and its discrete form attracted interest recently. Let $D$ and $\delta \Omega$ be the maximum vertex degree and the set of vertices of degree one in a graph $\mathcal{G}$ respectively. Let $\lambda_2$ be the first (non-trivial) Steklov eigenvalue of $(\mathcal{G}, \delta \Omega)$. In this paper, using the circle packing theorem and conformal mapping, we first show that $\lambda_2 \leq 8D / |\delta \Omega|$ for planar graphs. This can be seen as a discrete analogue of Kokarev's bound [Variational aspects of Laplace eigenvalues on Riemannian surfaces, Adv. Math. (2014)], that is, $\lambda_2 &lt; 8\pi / |\partial \Omega|$ for compact surfaces with boundary of genus $0$. Let $B$ and $L$ be the maximum block size and the diameter of a block graph $\mathcal{G}$ repsectively. Secondly, we prove that $\lambda_2 \leq B^2 (D-1)/ |\delta \Omega|$ and $\lambda_2 \leq (2L + (L-2)(B-2))/L^2$ for block graphs, which extend the results on trees by He and Hua [Upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues on trees, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2022)]. In the end, for trees with fixed leaf number and maximum degree, candidates that achieve the maximum first Steklov eigenvalue are given.</description>

Abstract: Recently, MacMahon's generalized sum-of-divisor functions were shown to link partitions, quasimodular forms, and q-multiple zeta values. In this paper, we explore many further properties and extensions of these. Firstly, we address a question of Ono by producing infinite families of MacMahon-like functions that approximate the colored partition functions (and indeed other eta quotients). We further explore the MacMahon-like functions and discover new and suggestive arithmetic structure and modular completions.</description>

      <title>The topology of data hides in quantum thermal states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a quantum protocol to perform topological data analysis (TDA) via the distillation of quantum thermal states. Recent developments of quantum thermal state preparation algorithms reveal their characteristic scaling defined by properties of dissipative Lindbladians. This contrasts with protocols based on unitary evolution which have a scaling depending on the properties of the combinatorial Laplacian. To leverage quantum thermal state preparation algorithms, we translate quantum TDA from a real-time to an imaginary-time picture, shifting the paradigm from a unitary approach to a dissipative one. Starting from an initial state overlapping with the ground state of the system, one can dissipate its energy via channels unique to the dataset, naturally distilling its information. Therefore calculating Betti numbers translates into a purity estimation. Alternatively, this can be interpreted as the evaluation of the R\'{e}nyi 2-entropy, Uhlmann fidelity or Hilbert-Schmidt distance relative to thermal states with the embedded topology of simplicial complexes. Our work opens the field of TDA toward a more physical interpretation of the topology of data.</description>

      <title>Open Packing in Graphs: Bounds and Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G(V,E)$, a vertex subset $S$ of $G$ is called an open packing in $G$ if no pair of distinct vertices in $S$ have a common neighbour in $G$. The size of a largest open packing in $G$ is called the open packing number, $\rho^o(G)$, of $G$. It would be interesting to note that the open packing number is a lower bound for the total domination number in graphs with no isolated vertices [Henning and Slater, 1999]. Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the decision problem OPEN PACKING tests whether $G$ has an open packing of size at least $k$. The optimization problem MAX-OPEN PACKING takes a graph $G$ as input and finds the open packing number of $G$. It is known that OPEN PACKING is NP-complete on split graphs (i.e., $\{2K_2,C_4,C_5\}$-free graphs) [Ramos et al., 2014]. In this work, we complete the study on the complexity (P vs NPC) of OPEN PACKING on $H$-free graphs for every graph $H$ with at least three vertices by proving that OPEN PACKING is (i) NP-complete on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs and (ii) polynomial time solvable on $(P_4\cup rK_1)$-free graphs for every $r\geq 1$. In the course of proving (ii), we show that for every $t\in {2,3,4}$ and $r\geq 1$, if G is a $(P_t\cup rK_1)$-free graph, then $\rho^o(G)$ is bounded above by a linear function of $r$. Moreover, we show that OPEN PACKING parameterized by solution size is W[1]-complete on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs and MAX-OPEN PACKING is hard to approximate within a factor of $n^{(\frac{1}{2}-\delta)}$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs unless P=NP. Further, we prove that OPEN PACKING is (a) NP-complete on $K_{1,4}$-free split graphs and (b) polynomial time solvable on $K_{1,3}$-free split graphs. We prove a similar dichotomy result on split graphs with degree restrictions on the vertices in the independent set of the clique-independent set partition of the split graphs.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in affine Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new and precise geometric descriptions of the conjugacy class $[x]$ and coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x') = \{ y \in \overline{W} \mid yxy^{-1} = x' \}$ for all elements $x,x'$ of any affine Coxeter group $\overline{W}$. The centralizer of $x$ in $\overline{W}$ is the special case $\operatorname{C}(x,x)$. The key structure in our description of the conjugacy class $[x]$ is the mod-set ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = (w-\operatorname{I})R^\vee$, where~$w$ is the finite part of $x$ and $R^\vee$ is the coroot lattice. The coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x')$ is then described by ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w')$ together with the fix-set of $w'$, where $w'$ is the finite part of $x'$. For any element $w$ of the associated finite Weyl group $W$, the mod-set of $w$ is contained in the classical move-set ${Mov}(w) = \operatorname{Im}(w - \operatorname{I})$. We prove that the rank of ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w)$ equals the dimension of ${Mov}(w)$, and then further investigate type-by-type the surprisingly subtle structure of the $\mathbb{Z}$-module ${Mod}_\overline{W}(w)$. As corollaries, we determine exactly when ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = {Mov}(w) \cap R^\vee$, in which case our closed-form descriptions of conjugacy classes and coconjugation sets are as simple as possible.</description>
