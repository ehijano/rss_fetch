      <title>Integral Bayesian symbolic regression for optimal discovery of governing equations from scarce and noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how systems evolve over time often requires discovering the differential equations that govern their behavior. Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology.</description>

      <title>Oscillation Quenching Induced By Time-Varying Coupling Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oscillatory dynamics of natural and man-made systems can be disrupted by their time-varying interactions, leading to oscillation quenching phenomena in which the oscillations are suppressed. We introduce a framework for analyzing, assessing, and controlling oscillation quenching using coupling functions. Specifically, by observing limit-cycle oscillators we investigate the bifurcations and dynamical transitions induced by time-varying diffusive and periodic coupling functions. We studied the transitions between oscillation quenching states induced by the time-varying form of the coupling function while the coupling strength is kept invariant. The time-varying periodic coupling function allowed us to identify novel, non-trivial inhomogeneous states that have not been reported previously. Furthermore, by using dynamical Bayesian inference we have also developed a Proportional Integral (PI) controller that maintains the oscillations and \red{prevents oscillation quenching from occurring}. In addition to the present implementation and its generalizations, the framework carries broader implications for identification and control of oscillation quenching in a wide range of systems subjected to time-varying interactions.</description>
