      <title>Digital Twin-Assisted Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in ISAC-Enabled Internet of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of the Internet of vehicles (IoV) and 6G networks is driving the evolution of next-generation intelligent transportation systems. However, IoV networks face persistent challenges, including low spectral efficiency in vehicular communications, difficulty in achieving dynamic and adaptive resource optimization, and the need for long-term stability under highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we study the problem of digital twin (DT)-assisted task offloading and resource allocation in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled IoV networks. The objective is to minimize the long-term average system cost, defined as a weighted combination of delay and energy consumption, while ensuring queue stability over time. To address this, we employ an ISAC-enabled design and introduce two transmission modes (i.e., raw data transmission (DataT) and instruction transmission (InstrT)). The InstrT mode enables instruction-level transmission, thereby reducing data volume and improving spectral efficiency. We then employ Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term stochastic problem into per-slot deterministic problems, ensuring long-term queue stability. Building upon this, we propose a Lyapunov-driven DT-enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization (Ly-DTMPPO) algorithm, which leverages DT for global state awareness and intelligent decision-making within a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture. Extensive simulations verify that Ly-DTMPPO achieves superior performance compared with existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Enabling Data-Driven Policymaking Using Broadband-Plan Querying Tool (BQT+)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poor broadband access undermines civic and economic life, a challenge exacerbated by the fact that millions of Americans still lack reliable high-speed connectivity. Federal broadband funding initiatives aim to address these gaps, but their success depends on accurate availability and affordability data. Existing data, often based on self-reported ISP information, can overstate coverage and speeds, risking misallocation of funds and leaving unserved communities behind. We present BQT+, an AI-agent data collection platform that queries ISP web interfaces by inputting residential street addresses and extracting data on service availability, quality, and pricing. BQT+ has been used in policy evaluation studies, including an independent assessment of broadband availability, speed tiers, and affordability in areas targeted by the $42.45 billion BEAD program.</description>

      <title>Learning a Decentralized Medium Access Control Protocol for Shared Message Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale Internet of things networks, efficient medium access control (MAC) is critical due to the growing number of devices competing for limited communication resources. In this work, we consider a new challenge in which a set of nodes must transmit a set of shared messages to a central controller, without inter-node communication or retransmissions. Messages are distributed among random subsets of nodes, which must implicitly coordinate their transmissions over shared communication opportunities. The objective is to guarantee the delivery of all shared messages, regardless of which nodes transmit them. We first prove the optimality of deterministic strategies, and characterize the success rate degradation of a deterministic strategy under dynamic message-transmission patterns. To solve this problem, we propose a decentralized learning-based framework that enables nodes to autonomously synthesize deterministic transmission strategies aiming to maximize message delivery success, together with an online adaptation mechanism that maintains stable performance in dynamic scenarios. Extensive simulations validate the framework's effectiveness, scalability, and adaptability, demonstrating its robustness to varying network sizes and fast adaptation to dynamic changes in transmission patterns, outperforming existing multi-armed bandit approaches.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation-based Model Poisoning on the Heterogeneous Internet of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Agents (IoA) envisions a unified, agent-centric paradigm where heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents can interconnect and collaborate at scale. Within this paradigm, federated learning (FL) serves as a key enabler that allows distributed LLM agents to co-train global models without centralizing data. However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which passively exploits observed benign local models to construct a parameter correlation graph and extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder to capture and reshape higher-order dependencies. The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server. Experiments demonstrate a gradual drop in system accuracy under the proposed attack and the ineffectiveness of the prevailing defense mechanism in detecting the attack, underscoring a severe threat to the ambitious IoA paradigm.</description>

      <title>Improving Remote Patient Monitoring Systems Using a Fog-based IoT Platform with Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the recent shortage of resources in the healthcare industry, Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems arose to establish a convenient alternative for accessing healthcare services remotely. However, as the usage of this system grows with the increase of patients and sensing devices, data and network management becomes an issue. As a result, wireless architecture challenges in patient privacy, data flow, and service interactability surface that need addressing. We propose a fog-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform to address these issues and reinforce the existing RPM system. The introduced platform can allocate resources to alleviate server overloading and provide an interactive means of monitoring patients through speech recognition. We designed a testbed to simulate and test the platform in terms of accuracy, latency, and throughput. The results show the platform's potential as a viable RPM system for sound-based healthcare services.</description>

      <title>When Intelligence Overloads Infrastructure: A Forecast Model for AI-Driven Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of AI agents and connected devices fundamentally transforms the structure and capacity demands of global digital infrastructure. This paper introduces a unified forecasting model that projects AI agent populations to increase by more than 100 times between 2026 and 2036+, reaching trillions of instances globally. In parallel, bandwidth demand is expected to surge from 1 EB/day in 2026 to over 8,000 EB/day by 2036, which is an increase of 8000 times in a single decade. Through this growth model, we identify critical bottleneck domains across access networks, edge gateways, interconnection exchanges, and cloud infrastructures. Simulations reveal that edge and peering systems will experience saturation as early as 2030, with more than 70% utilization of projected maximum capacity by 2033. To address these constraints, we propose a coevolutionary shift in compute-network design, emphasizing distributed inference, AI-native traffic engineering, and intent-aware orchestration. Security, scalability, and coordination challenges are examined with a focus on sustaining intelligent connectivity throughout the next digital decade.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Resilience in 6G and Beyond Network Energy Saving: A Multi-Agent DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted resilience perspective in the 6G network energy saving (NES) scenario. More specifically, we consider multiple ground base stations (GBSs) and each GBS has three different sectors/cells in the terrestrial networks, and multiple cells are turned off due to NES or incidents, e.g., disasters, hardware failures, or outages. To address this, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) framework to enable UAV-assisted communication by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, transmission power, and user-UAV association under a sleeping ground base station (GBS) strategy. This framework aims to ensure the resilience of active users in the network and the long-term operability of UAVs. Specifically, it maximizes service coverage for users during power outages or NES zones, while minimizing the energy consumption of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG policy consistently achieves high coverage ratio across different testing episodes, outperforming other baselines. Moreover, the MADDPG framework attains the lowest total energy consumption, with a reduction of approximately 24\% compared to the conventional all GBS ON configuration, while maintaining a comparable user service rate. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving a superior trade-off between energy efficiency and service performance, supporting the development of sustainable and resilient UAV-assisted cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness of IoT Intrusion Detection via SHAP-Based Attribution Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed numerous industries by enabling seamless connectivity and data-driven automation. However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\epsilon$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</description>

      <title>CYPRESS: Transferring Secrets in the Shadow of Visible Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network steganography and covert communication channels have been studied extensively in the past. However, prior works offer minimal practical use for their proposed techniques and are limited to specific use cases and network protocols. In this paper, we show that covert channels in networking have a much greater potential for practical secret communication than what has been discussed before. We present a covert channel framework, CYPRESS, that creates a reliable hidden communication channel by mounting packets from secret network entities on regular packets that flow through the network, effectively transmitting a separate network traffic without generating new packets for it. CYPRESS establishes a consolidated decentralized framework in which different covert channels for various protocols are defined with their custom handler code that are plugged into the system and updated on-demand to evade detection. CYPRESS then chooses at run-time how and in what order the covert channels should be used for fragmentation and hidden transmission of data. We can reach up to 1.6MB/s of secret bandwidth in a network of ten users connected to the Internet. We demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our approach in secret communication through various security-sensitive real-world experiments. Our evaluations show that network protocols provide a notable opportunity for unconventional storage and hidden transmission of data to bypass different types of security measures and to hide the source of various cyber attacks.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Diffusion-Based Recommender Systems via Reinforcement Learning with Reward Function Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommender systems, offering state-of-the-art performance by modeling the generative process of user-item interactions. However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios. The source code and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFiT-4C60.</description>

      <title>Resilient by Design -- Active Inference for Distributed Continuum Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Failures are the norm in highly complex and heterogeneous devices spanning the distributed computing continuum (DCC), from resource-constrained IoT and edge nodes to high-performance computing systems. Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free-energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled next-generation MIMO networks. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO networks from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Hermes, a general-purpose networking architecture that aims to improve service delivery over the Internet. Hermes delegates networking responsibilities from applications and services to proxies and is designed as a portable, adaptable solution to four fundamental challenges of efficient service delivery over the Internet: end-to-end traffic management, backward compatibility, data-plane security and privacy, and adaptable communication layers. The design centers on an overlay of reconfigurable proxies and HTTP tunneling and proxying techniques, utilizing assisting components to extend proxy functionality when needed. Through prototyping and emulation, we demonstrate that Hermes improves key performance metrics across multiple use cases: it provides backward compatibility through protocol translation and tunneling, improves reliability by delegating retry logic to proxies, enables unified policy-based Layer 3 routing across network segments, and serves as an efficient substrate for future architectures like NDN, facilitating their operation over the Internet. Beyond evaluating Hermes across various use cases, we measured the overhead of Hermes' HTTP tunneling and proxying mechanisms and found it to be modest, typically under 2 ms per hop. With workloads of up to 1000 concurrent requests, we also show that Hermes proxies can amortize connection setup time and reduce end-to-end latency compared to direct no-proxy baselines.</description>

      <title>TIMESAFE: Timing Interruption Monitoring and Security Assessment for Fronthaul Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular systems embrace the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, exemplified by the evolution of the fronthaul (FH) connection between cellular baseband and radio unit equipment. Crucially, synchronization over the FH is pivotal for reliable 5G services. In recent years, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet network topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, TSN standards, such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP), focus on performance with little to no concern for security. This increases the exposure of the open FH to security risks. Attacks targeting synchronization mechanisms pose significant threats, potentially disrupting 5G networks and impairing connectivity.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of successful spoofing and replay attacks against PTP synchronization. We show how a spoofing attack is able to cause a production-ready O-RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular base station to catastrophically fail within 2 seconds of the attack, necessitating manual intervention to restore full network operations. To counter this, we design a Machine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various malicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Indoor LoRaWAN Ranging Using Path Loss Model Inversion and Adaptive RSSI Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving sub-10 m indoor ranging with LoRaWAN is difficult because multipath, human blockage, and micro-climate dynamics induce non-stationary attenuation in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. We present a lightweight, interpretable pipeline that couples an environment-aware multi-wall path loss model with a forward-only, innovation-driven Kalman prefilter for RSSI. The model augments distance and wall terms with frequency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and co-located environmental covariates (temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), and is inverted deterministically for distance estimation. On a one-year single-gateway office dataset comprising over 2 million uplinks, the approach attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.74 m and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.76 m in distance estimation, improving over a COST-231 multi-wall baseline (12.07 m MAE) and its environment-augmented variant (7.76 m MAE. Filtering reduces RSSI volatility from 10.33 to 5.43 dB and halves path loss error to 5.35 dB while raising R-squared from 0.82 to 0.89. The result is a single-anchor LoRaWAN ranging method with constant per-packet cost that is accurate, robust, and interpretable, providing a strong building block for multi-gateway localization.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks using Subgraph Complementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13700v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks are important for quantum communication, enabling tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and quantum error correction, often utilizing graph states, a specific class of multipartite entangled states that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing graph states across a quantum network. We show that the distribution of graph states can be characterized by a system of subgraph complementations, which we also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree of entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyze resource usage for our algorithm and show that it improves on the number of qubits, bits for classical communication, and EPR pairs utilized, as compared to prior work. In fact, the number of local operations and resource consumption for our approach scales linearly in the number of vertices. This produces a quadratic improvement in completion time for several classes of graph states represented by dense graphs, which translates into an exponential improvement by allowing parallelization of gate operations. This leads to improved fidelities in the presence of noisy operations, as we show through simulation in the presence of noisy operations. We classify common classes of graph states, along with their optimal distribution time using subgraph complementations. We find a sequence of subgraph complementation operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state which we conjecture is close to the optimal sequence, and establish upper bounds on distribution time along with providing approximate greedy algorithms.</description>

      <title>Seagull: Privacy preserving network verification system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Internet relies on routing protocols to direct traffic efficiently across interconnected networks, with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) serving as the core mechanism managing routing between autonomous systems. However, BGP configurations are largely manual, making them susceptible to human errors that can lead to outages or security vulnerabilities. Verifying the correctness and convergence of BGP configurations is therefore essential for maintaining a stable and secure Internet. Yet, this verification process faces two key challenges: preserving the privacy of proprietary routing information and ensuring scalability across large, distributed networks. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving verification framework that leverages multiparty computation (MPC) to validate BGP configurations without exposing sensitive routing data. Our approach overcomes both privacy and scalability challenges by ensuring that no information beyond the verification outcome is revealed. Through formal analysis, we show that the proposed method achieves strong privacy guarantees and practical scalability, providing a secure and efficient foundation for verifying BGP-based routing in the Internet backbone.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Network Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).</description>
