      <title>A Partition-insensitive Parallel Framework for Distributed Model Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed model fitting refers to the process of fitting a mathematical or statistical model to the data using distributed computing resources, such that computing tasks are divided among multiple interconnected computers or nodes, often organized in a cluster or network. Most of the existing methods for distributed model fitting are to formulate it in a consensus optimization problem, and then build up algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This paper introduces a novel parallel framework for achieving a distributed model fitting. In contrast to previous consensus frameworks, the introduced parallel framework offers two notable advantages. Firstly, it exhibits insensitivity to sample partitioning, meaning that the solution of the algorithm remains unaffected by variations in the number of slave nodes or/and the amount of data each node carries. Secondly, fewer variables are required to be updated at each iteration, so that the proposed parallel framework performs in a more succinct and efficient way, and adapts to high-dimensional data. In addition, we prove that the algorithms under the new parallel framework have a worst-case linear convergence rate in theory. Numerical experiments confirm the generality, robustness, and accuracy of our proposed parallel framework.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Joint Additive Factor Models for Multiview Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is increasingly common in a wide variety of applied settings to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors. Our open-source software (R package) is available at https://github.com/niccoloanceschi/jafar.</description>

      <title>A class of sequential multi-hypothesis tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with sequential testing of multiple hypotheses. In the general scheme of construction of optimal tests based on the backward induction, we propose a modification which provides a simplified (generally speaking, suboptimal) version of the optimal test, for any particular criterion of optimization. We call this DBC version (the one with Dropped Backward Control) of the optimal test. In particular, for the case of two simple hypotheses, dropping backward control in the Bayesian test produces the classical sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Similarly, dropping backward control in the modified Kiefer-Weiss solutions produces Lorden's 2-SPRTs .
  In the case of more than two hypotheses, we obtain in this way new classes of sequential multi-hypothesis tests, and investigate their properties. The efficiency of the DBC-tests is evaluated with respect to the optimal Bayesian multi-hypothesis test and with respect to the matrix sequential probability ratio test (MSPRT) by Armitage. In a multihypothesis variant of the Kiefer-Weiss problem for binomial proportions the performance of the DBC-test is numerically compared with that of the exact solution. In a model of normal observations with a linear trend, the performance of of the DBC-test is numerically compared with that of the MSPRT. Some other numerical examples are presented.
  In all the cases the proposed tests exhibit a very high efficiency with respect to the optimal tests (more than 99.3\% when sampling from Bernoulli populations) and/or with respect to the MSPRT (even outperforming the latter in some scenarios).</description>

      <title>Aging modeling and lifetime prediction of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell using an extended Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a methodology that aims to model and to provide predictive capabilities for the lifetime of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). The approach integrates parametric identification, dynamic modeling, and Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF). The foundation is laid with the creation of a representative aging database, emphasizing specific operating conditions. Electrochemical behavior is characterized through the identification of critical parameters. The methodology extends to capture the temporal evolution of the identified parameters. We also address challenges posed by the limiting current density through a differential analysis-based modeling technique and the detection of breakpoints. This approach, involving Monte Carlo simulations, is coupled with an EKF for predicting voltage degradation. The Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is also estimated. The results show that our approach accurately predicts future voltage and RUL with very low relative errors.</description>

      <title>Parameterizations for Gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo on the Stiefel Manifold: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal matrices play an important role in probability and statistics, particularly in high-dimensional statistical models. Parameterizing these models using orthogonal matrices facilitates dimension reduction and parameter identification. However, establishing the theoretical validity of statistical inference in these models from a frequentist perspective is challenging, leading to a preference for Bayesian approaches because of their ability to offer consistent uncertainty quantification. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are commonly used for numerical approximation of posterior distributions, and sampling on the Stiefel manifold, which comprises orthogonal matrices, poses significant difficulties. While various strategies have been proposed for this purpose, gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo with parameterizations is the most efficient. However, a comprehensive comparison of these parameterizations is lacking in the existing literature. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating numerical efficiency of the four alternative parameterizations of orthogonal matrices under equivalent conditions. The evaluation was conducted for four problems. The results suggest that polar expansion parameterization is the most efficient, particularly for the high-dimensional and complex problems. However, all parameterizations exhibit limitations in significantly high-dimensional or difficult tasks, emphasizing the need for further advancements in sampling methods for orthogonal matrices.</description>

      <title>Generalized Posterior Calibration via Sequential Monte Carlo Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the amount and complexity of available data increases, the need for robust statistical learning becomes more pressing. To enhance resilience against model misspecification, the generalized posterior inference method adjusts the likelihood term by exponentiating it with a learning rate, thereby fine-tuning the dispersion of the posterior distribution. This study proposes a computationally efficient strategy for selecting an appropriate learning rate. The proposed approach builds upon the generalized posterior calibration (GPC) algorithm, which is designed to select a learning rate that ensures nominal frequentist coverage. This algorithm, which evaluates the coverage probability using bootstrap samples, has high computational costs because of the repeated posterior simulations needed for bootstrap samples. To address this limitation, the study proposes an algorithm that combines elements of the GPC algorithm with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler. By leveraging the similarity between the learning rate in generalized posterior inference and the inverse temperature in SMC sampling, the proposed algorithm efficiently calibrates the posterior distribution with a reduced computational cost. For demonstration, the proposed algorithm was applied to several statistical learning models and shown to be significantly faster than the original GPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the ARR2 prior, a joint prior over the auto-regressive components in Bayesian time-series models and their induced $R^2$. Compared to other priors designed for times-series models, the ARR2 prior allows for flexible and intuitive shrinkage. We derive the prior for pure auto-regressive models, and extend it to auto-regressive models with exogenous inputs, and state-space models. Through both simulations and real-world modelling exercises, we demonstrate the efficacy of the ARR2 prior in improving sparse and reliable inference, while showing greater inference quality and predictive performance than other shrinkage priors. An open-source implementation of the prior is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "mdendro" is an R package that provides a comprehensive collection of linkage methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering on a matrix of proximity data (distances or similarities), returning a multifurcated dendrogram or multidendrogram. Multidendrograms can group more than two clusters at the same time, solving the nonuniqueness problem that arises when there are ties in the data. This problem causes that different binary dendrograms are possible depending both on the order of the input data and on the criterion used to break ties. Weighted and unweighted versions of the most common linkage methods are included in the package, which also implements two parametric linkage methods. In addition, package "mdendro" provides five descriptive measures to analyze the resulting dendrograms: cophenetic correlation coefficient, space distortion ratio, agglomeration coefficient, chaining coefficient and tree balance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are frequently used to analyze time series data. Despite the popularity of these models, likelihood-based inference for ARMA models has subtleties that have been previously identified but continue to cause difficulties in widely used data analysis strategies. We provide a summary of parameter estimation via maximum likelihood and discuss common pitfalls that may lead to sub-optimal parameter estimates. We propose a random initialization algorithm for parameter estimation that frequently yields higher likelihoods than traditional maximum likelihood estimation procedures. We then investigate the parameter uncertainty of maximum likelihood estimates, and propose the use of profile confidence intervals as a superior alternative to intervals derived from the Fisher's information matrix. Through a series of simulation studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and the improved nominal coverage of profile confidence intervals compared to the normal approximation based on Fisher's Information.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-Conditional Simulation for ABC Inference in Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian inference method for discretely-observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Inference is challenging for most SDEs, due to the analytical intractability of the likelihood function. Nevertheless, forward simulation via numerical methods is straightforward, motivating the use of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We propose a conditional simulation scheme for SDEs that is based on lookahead strategies for sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and particle smoothing using backward simulation. This leads to the simulation of trajectories that are consistent with the observed trajectory, thereby increasing the ABC acceptance rate. We additionally employ an invariant neural network, previously developed for Markov processes, to learn the summary statistics function required in ABC. The neural network is incrementally retrained by exploiting an ABC-SMC sampler, which provides new training data at each round. Since the SDEs simulation scheme differs from standard forward simulation, we propose a suitable importance sampling correction, which has the added advantage of guiding the parameters towards regions of high posterior density, especially in the first ABC-SMC round. Our approach achieves accurate inference and is about three times faster than standard (forward-only) ABC-SMC. We illustrate our method in five simulation studies, including three examples from the Chan-Karaolyi-Longstaff-Sanders SDE family, a stochastic bi-stable model (Schl{\"o}gl) that is notoriously challenging for ABC methods, and a two dimensional biochemical reaction network.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability in Bayesian Nonparametric Factor Analysis of Spatiotemporal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript puts forward novel practicable spatiotemporal Bayesian factor analysis frameworks computationally feasible for moderate to large data. Our models exhibit significantly enhanced computational scalability and storage efficiency, deliver high overall modeling performances, and possess powerful inferential capabilities for adequately predicting outcomes at future time points or new spatial locations and satisfactorily clustering spatial locations into regions with similar temporal trajectories, a frequently encountered crucial task. We integrate on top of a baseline separable factor model with temporally dependent latent factors and spatially dependent factor loadings under a probit stick breaking process (PSBP) prior a new slice sampling algorithm that permits unknown varying numbers of spatial mixture components across all factors and guarantees them to be non-increasing through the MCMC iterations, thus considerably enhancing model flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. We further introduce a novel spatial latent nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) prior and new sequential updating algorithms for the spatially varying latent variables in the PSBP prior, thereby attaining high spatial scalability. The markedly accelerated posterior sampling and spatial prediction as well as the great modeling and inferential performances of our models are substantiated by our simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Provably Scalable Black-Box Variational Inference with Structured Variational Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational families with full-rank covariance approximations are known not to work well in black-box variational inference (BBVI), both empirically and theoretically. In fact, recent computational complexity results for BBVI have established that full-rank variational families scale poorly with the dimensionality of the problem compared to e.g. mean-field families. This is particularly critical to hierarchical Bayesian models with local variables; their dimensionality increases with the size of the datasets. Consequently, one gets an iteration complexity with an explicit (\mathcal{O}(N^2)) dependence on the dataset size (N). In this paper, we explore a theoretical middle ground between mean-field variational families and full-rank families: structured variational families. We rigorously prove that certain scale matrix structures can achieve a better iteration complexity of (\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)), implying better scaling with respect to (N). We empirically verify our theoretical results on large-scale hierarchical models.</description>

      <title>SMC Is All You Need: Parallel Strong Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayesian posterior distribution can only be evaluated up-to a constant of proportionality, which makes simulation and consistent estimation challenging. Classical consistent Bayesian methods such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) have unbounded time complexity requirements. We develop a fully parallel sequential Monte Carlo (pSMC) method which provably delivers parallel strong scaling, i.e. the time complexity (and per-node memory) remains bounded if the number of asynchronous processes is allowed to grow. More precisely, the pSMC has a theoretical convergence rate of Mean Square Error (MSE)$ = O(1/NP)$, where $N$ denotes the number of communicating samples in each processor and $P$ denotes the number of processors. In particular, for suitably-large problem-dependent $N$, as $P \rightarrow \infty$ the method converges to infinitesimal accuracy MSE$=O(\varepsilon^2)$ with a fixed finite time-complexity Cost$=O(1)$ and with no efficiency leakage, i.e. computational complexity Cost$=O(\varepsilon^{-2})$. A number of Bayesian inference problems are taken into consideration to compare the pSMC and MCMC methods.</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Longitudinal Measurements and Time-to-event Outcomes Using BUGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to provide an introduction to the principles of Bayesian joint modeling of longitudinal measurements and time-to-event outcomes, as well as model implementation using the BUGS language syntax. This syntax can be executed directly using OpenBUGS or by utilizing convenient functions to invoke OpenBUGS and JAGS from R software. In this paper, all details of joint models are provided, ranging from simple to more advanced models. The presentation started with the joint modeling of a Gaussian longitudinal marker and time-to-event outcome. The implementation of the Bayesian paradigm of the model is reviewed. The strategies for simulating data from the JM are also discussed. A proportional hazard model with various forms of baseline hazards, along with the discussion of all possible association structures between the two sub-models are taken into consideration. The paper covers joint models with multivariate longitudinal measurements, zero-inflated longitudinal measurements, competing risks, and time-to-event with cure fraction. The models are illustrated by the analyses of several real data sets. All simulated and real data and code are available at \url{https://github.com/tbaghfalaki/JM-with-BUGS-and-JAGS}.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Orthogonalization for Models with Non-Linearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of black-box algorithms can lead to various challenges, including the introduction of biases. These biases present immediate risks in the algorithms' application. It was, for instance, shown that neural networks can deduce racial information solely from a patient's X-ray scan, a task beyond the capability of medical experts. If this fact is not known to the medical expert, automatic decision-making based on this algorithm could lead to prescribing a treatment (purely) based on racial information. While current methodologies allow for the "orthogonalization" or "normalization" of neural networks with respect to such information, existing approaches are grounded in linear models. Our paper advances the discourse by introducing corrections for non-linearities such as ReLU activations. Our approach also encompasses scalar and tensor-valued predictions, facilitating its integration into neural network architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate our method's effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data in generalized linear models, normalizing convolutional neural networks for metadata, and rectifying pre-existing embeddings for undesired attributes.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new simple and explicit numerical scheme for time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations. The scheme is based on sampling increments at each time step from a skew-symmetric probability distribution, with the level of skewness determined by the drift and volatility of the underlying process. We show that as the step-size decreases the scheme converges weakly to the diffusion of interest. We then consider the problem of simulating from the limiting distribution of an ergodic diffusion process using the numerical scheme with a fixed step-size. We establish conditions under which the numerical scheme converges to equilibrium at a geometric rate, and quantify the bias between the equilibrium distributions of the scheme and of the true diffusion process. Notably, our results do not require a global Lipschitz assumption on the drift, in contrast to those required for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for long-time simulation at fixed step-sizes. Our weak convergence result relies on an extension of the theory of Milstein \&amp; Tretyakov to stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift, which could also be of independent interest. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>
