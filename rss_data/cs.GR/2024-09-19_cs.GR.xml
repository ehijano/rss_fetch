      <title>High performance Lunar landing simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous precision navigation to land onto the Moon relies on vision sensors. Computer vision algorithms are designed, trained and tested using synthetic simulations. High quality terrain models have been produced by Moon orbiters developed by several nations, with resolutions ranging from tens or hundreds of meters globally down to few meters locally. The SurRender software is a powerful simulator able to exploit the full potential of these datasets in raytracing. New interfaces include tools to fuse multi-resolution DEMs and procedural texture generation. A global model of the Moon at 20m resolution was integrated representing several terabytes of data which SurRender can render continuously and in real-time. This simulator will be a precious asset for the development of future missions.</description>

      <title>GaussianHeads: End-to-End Learning of Drivable Gaussian Head Avatars from Coarse-to-fine Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time rendering of human head avatars is a cornerstone of many computer graphics applications, such as augmented reality, video games, and films, to name a few. Recent approaches address this challenge with computationally efficient geometry primitives in a carefully calibrated multi-view setup. Albeit producing photorealistic head renderings, it often fails to represent complex motion changes such as the mouth interior and strongly varying head poses. We propose a new method to generate highly dynamic and deformable human head avatars from multi-view imagery in real-time. At the core of our method is a hierarchical representation of head models that allows to capture the complex dynamics of facial expressions and head movements. First, with rich facial features extracted from raw input frames, we learn to deform the coarse facial geometry of the template mesh. We then initialize 3D Gaussians on the deformed surface and refine their positions in a fine step. We train this coarse-to-fine facial avatar model along with the head pose as a learnable parameter in an end-to-end framework. This enables not only controllable facial animation via video inputs, but also high-fidelity novel view synthesis of challenging facial expressions, such as tongue deformations and fine-grained teeth structure under large motion changes. Moreover, it encourages the learned head avatar to generalize towards new facial expressions and head poses at inference time. We demonstrate the performance of our method with comparisons against the related methods on different datasets, spanning challenging facial expression sequences across multiple identities. We also show the potential application of our approach by demonstrating a cross-identity facial performance transfer application.</description>

      <title>Differential Walk on Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Monte Carlo method for computing derivatives of the solution to a partial differential equation (PDE) with respect to problem parameters (such as domain geometry or boundary conditions). Derivatives can be evaluated at arbitrary points, without performing a global solve or constructing a volumetric grid or mesh. The method is hence well suited to inverse problems with complex geometry, such as PDE-constrained shape optimization. Like other walk on spheres (WoS) algorithms, our method is trivial to parallelize, and is agnostic to boundary representation (meshes, splines, implicit surfaces, etc.), supporting large topological changes. We focus in particular on screened Poisson equations, which model diverse problems from scientific and geometric computing. As in differentiable rendering, we jointly estimate derivatives with respect to all parameters -- hence, cost does not grow significantly with parameter count. In practice, even noisy derivative estimates exhibit fast, stable convergence for stochastic gradient-based optimization, as we show through examples from thermal design, shape from diffusion, and computer graphics.</description>

      <title>GaussianObject: High-Quality 3D Object Reconstruction from Four Views with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from highly sparse views is of critical importance for promoting applications of 3D vision techniques and improving user experience. However, images from sparse views only contain very limited 3D information, leading to two significant challenges: 1) Difficulty in building multi-view consistency as images for matching are too few; 2) Partially omitted or highly compressed object information as view coverage is insufficient. To tackle these challenges, we propose GaussianObject, a framework to represent and render the 3D object with Gaussian splatting that achieves high rendering quality with only 4 input images. We first introduce techniques of visual hull and floater elimination, which explicitly inject structure priors into the initial optimization process to help build multi-view consistency, yielding a coarse 3D Gaussian representation. Then we construct a Gaussian repair model based on diffusion models to supplement the omitted object information, where Gaussians are further refined. We design a self-generating strategy to obtain image pairs for training the repair model. We further design a COLMAP-free variant, where pre-given accurate camera poses are not required, which achieves competitive quality and facilitates wider applications. GaussianObject is evaluated on several challenging datasets, including MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, OpenIllumination, and our-collected unposed images, achieving superior performance from only four views and significantly outperforming previous SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>LetsGo: Large-Scale Garage Modeling and Rendering via LiDAR-Assisted Gaussian Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large garages are ubiquitous yet intricate scenes that present unique challenges due to their monotonous colors, repetitive patterns, reflective surfaces, and transparent vehicle glass. Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction often fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction. To address these challenges, we introduce LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting framework for large-scale garage modeling and rendering. We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate data acquisition. Using this Polar device, we present the GarageWorld dataset, consisting of eight expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures, which will be made publicly available for further research. Our approach demonstrates that LiDAR point clouds collected by the Polar device significantly enhance a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering. We introduce a novel depth regularizer that effectively eliminates floating artifacts in rendered images. Additionally, we propose a multi-resolution 3D Gaussian representation designed for Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering. This includes adapted scaling factors for individual levels and a random-resolution-level training scheme to optimize the Gaussians across different resolutions. This representation enables efficient rendering of large-scale garage scenes on lightweight devices via a web-based renderer. Experimental results on our GarageWorld dataset, as well as on ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of rendering quality and resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>3D Reconstruction with Fast Dipole Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for high-quality 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Our method uses a new point-based representation, the regularized dipole sum, which generalizes the winding number to allow for interpolation of per-point attributes in point clouds with noisy or outlier points. Using regularized dipole sums, we represent implicit geometry and radiance fields as per-point attributes of a dense point cloud, which we initialize from structure from motion. We additionally derive Barnes-Hut fast summation schemes for accelerated forward and adjoint dipole sum queries. These queries facilitate the use of ray tracing to efficiently and differentiably render images with our point-based representations, and thus update their point attributes to optimize scene geometry and appearance. We evaluate our method in inverse rendering applications against state-of-the-art alternatives, based on ray tracing of neural representations or rasterization of Gaussian point-based representations. Our method significantly improves 3D reconstruction quality and robustness at equal runtimes, while also supporting more general rendering methods such as shadow rays for direct illumination.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Temporal Topic Embeddings with a Compass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic topic modeling is useful at discovering the development and change in latent topics over time. However, present methodology relies on algorithms that separate document and word representations. This prevents the creation of a meaningful embedding space where changes in word usage and documents can be directly analyzed in a temporal context. This paper proposes an expansion of the compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology into dynamic topic modeling. Such a method allows for the direct comparison of word and document embeddings across time in dynamic topics. This enables the creation of visualizations that incorporate temporal word embeddings within the context of documents into topic visualizations. In experiments against the current state-of-the-art, our proposed method demonstrates overall competitive performance in topic relevancy and diversity across temporal datasets of varying size. Simultaneously, it provides insightful visualizations focused on temporal word embeddings while maintaining the insights provided by global topic evolution, advancing our understanding of how topics evolve over time.</description>
