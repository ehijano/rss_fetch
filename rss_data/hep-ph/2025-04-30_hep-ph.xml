      <title>The Weak Gravity Conjecture in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) posits that gravity must be the weakest force in any consistent theory of quantum gravity. Originally formulated to constrain the landscape of effective field theories arising from string theory, the WGC suggests the existence of states with a charge-to-mass ratio larger than that of extremal black holes. In this work, we revisit the WGC within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity, a non-perturbative approach where gravitational and gauge couplings flow to a non-Gaussian ultraviolet (UV) fixed point. We construct a scale-dependent effective action, derive quantum-corrected Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole solutions by incorporating position-dependent renormalization scale identification, and compute leading quantum corrections to the extremality condition. Our key finding is that the quantum correction to the extremal charge-to-mass ratio is dominantly governed by the running of the gauge coupling, characterized by a correction parameter $\delta \sim \epsilon_e (\ell_P/r_+)^{2\theta}$, where $\epsilon_e$ captures deviations from infrared behavior. We show that if the electromagnetic coupling grows in the UV ($\epsilon_e &gt; \epsilon_G$), the WGC is dynamically strengthened, whereas if it decreases ($\epsilon_e &lt; \epsilon_G$), large extremal black holes may violate the WGC unless additional light charged states exist. Our analysis demonstrates that Asymptotic Safety provides a concrete ultraviolet mechanism influencing low-energy swampland criteria, offering a deep UV/IR connection between quantum gravity consistency and effective field theory behavior.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves as Cosmic Tracers of Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that induced gravitational waves (IGWs) can naturally emerge within the frame- work of thermal leptogenesis models, thereby providing a robust probe for exploring this theory at remarkably high energy scales. To illustrate this principle, we put forth a basic leptogenesis model in which an early matter-dominated phase, tracing the leptogenesis scale, enhances the generation of gravitational waves induced by an early structure formation. Leveraging recent N-body and lat- tice simulation results for IGW computations in the non-linear regime, we show that it is possible to establish a direct link between the frequency and amplitude of these IGWs and the thermal leptogenesis scale.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosity for a pure glue theory using an effective matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At nonzero temperatures, the deconfining phase transition can be analyzed using an effective matrix model to characterize the change in holonomy. The model includes gluons and two-dimensional ghost fields in the adjoint representation, or ``teens''. As ghosts, the teen fields are responsible for the decrease of the pressure as $T \rightarrow T_d$, with $T_d$ the transition temperature for deconfinement. Using the solution of this matrix model for a large number of colors, the parameters of the teen fields are adjusted so that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is close to the values from the lattice. The shear, $\eta$, and bulk, $\zeta$, viscosities are computed in weak coupling but nonzero holonomy. In the pure glue theory, the value of the Polyakov loop is relatively large in the deconfined phase, $\approx 1/2$ at $T_d$. Consequently, if $s$ is the entropy density, while $\eta/s$ decreases as $T\rightarrow T_d$, it is still well above the conformal bound. In contrast, $\zeta/s$ is largest at $T_d$, comparable to $\eta/s$, then falls off rapidly with increasing temperature and is negligible by $\sim 2 T_d$.</description>

      <title>Implications of the KM3NeT Ultrahigh-energy Event on Neutrino Self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions ({\nu}SI) mediated by light bosonic particles can produce characteristic spectral dips in astrophysical neutrino fluxes, thereby modifying the expected energy spectrum. The high-energy astrophysical neutrino spectrum has been extensively used to probe {\nu}SI models through these distinctive features. The recent detection of the ultrahigh-energy event KM3-230213A offers a new opportunity to explore {\nu}SI phenomenology at extreme energies. In this work, we investigate two implications of this observation under the assumption that the event originates from a diffuse power-law spectrum. First, we find that {\nu}SI induces spectral distortions that can mildly alleviate tensions between the KM3-230213A detection and the previous non-observation of PeV-scale neutrinos in IceCube data. Second, we derive new constraints on the {\nu}SI coupling strength for mediator masses around 100 MeV. Our analysis shows that neutrino telescopes can surpass existing collider constraints in this mass range. In the near future, IceCube-Gen2 is expected to substantially enhance the sensitivity to {\nu}SI over a broader range of parameter space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is my individual contribution to the discussions ongoing on the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. After participating in many discussions and contributing to a number of documents being prepared for the ESPP submission, I came to the conclusion that these ``official'' documents do not give the whole picture. I wanted to express my concerns about the strategy update process and the possible choice of FCC as the next flagship project at CERN. I do hope my short contribution is found relevant by those interested in the strategy update process.</description>

      <title>F-Term Hybrid Inflation, Metastable Cosmic Strings and Low Reheating in View of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the formation of metastable cosmic strings in a left-right unified theory. The produced monopoles are diluted by a stage of F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) which is realized consistently with the SUSY breaking and a global $U(1)$ $R$ symmetry in the context of a $U(1)_{\rm R}\times U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of MSSM. The hidden-sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be compatible with data -- including the recent ACT results --, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range $(0.1-70)$ TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of cosmic strings. Their dimensionless tension $G\mu_{\rm cs}\simeq(1-11)\cdot10^{-8}$ interprets the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves. The $\mu$ parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the $R$ saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about $34$ GeV. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

      <title>Power corrections to the heavy electron form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first power correction to the heavy electron form factor in QED. We show that the first power correction factorizes as a derivative operator. We discuss the result in QED with no light fermions, where the first power correction can be written explicitly in terms of one loop integrals and the anomalous magnetic moment. In the presence of light fermions, the heavy electron form factor admits a representation as a sum over matrix elements, each of which receives corrections from higher orders in perturbation theory. From this analysis we are able to extract the NLP soft photon theorem in the limit of heavy fermion initiated dijet events. This is a first step towards studying the heavy quark form factor in the non-abelian theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Form Factors and the QCD Dilaton at Large Momentum Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hard scatterings of hadronic matrix elements corresponding to hadronic gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion and proton using QCD factorization, applying conformal field theory (CFT) tools. These GFFs are key to understanding quark and gluon angular momentum via their connection to DVCS moments. The core object is the non-Abelian \( TJJ \) 3-point function, which shows an anomaly-induced dilaton exchange in the \( t \)-channel. We analyze quark, ghost, and gauge-fixing effects through a CFT-based decomposition and propose a parameterization useful for future DVCS studies at the Electron-Ion Collider. The dilaton interaction is interpolated by a conformal anomaly form factor, defined in the nonconformal case, which is constrained by a (dilaton) sum rule.</description>

      <title>Timelike form factor for the anomalous process $\gamma^\ast \pi \rightarrow \pi \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The form factor $F_\3pi(s,t,u)$ for the anomalous process $\gamma^\ast \pi \rightarrow \pi \pi$ is calculated in the isospin limit for several values of the light current-quark mass (i.e., the pion mass) using Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations. Beyond a quark interaction kernel representing gluon-mediated interactions, leading beyond-rainbow-ladder effects at low energies are incorporated by back-coupling pions as explicit degrees of freedom. Building upon an earlier calculation of the quark-photon vertex that captures the branch cut associated with the two-pion threshold and the rho meson resonance, the form factor $F_\3pi(s,t,u)$ is determined for timelike Mandelstam s. In particular, predictions are made for the kinematics relevant for the Primakoff reaction studied with COMPASS/AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Antideutron Interaction with Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest to use the intranuclear cascade model (INC) for simulation of antideutron-nucleus inelastic interaction in the region of antideutron energies of $100$ MeV/n $\le T_{kin}\le 25-30$ GeV/n for a wide range of target nuclei. With the help of the model we obtain the cross-section $\sigma_{in}$ for inelastic antideutron-nucleus interaction and compare it with the ALICE experimental data.
  The model is in good agreement with the available experimental data on the inelastic interaction of antideutrons with tantalum nucleus. We have created a Monte Carlo generator for simulation of inelastic interaction of antideutrons with nuclei. This generator can be useful in the preparation and analysis of experiments to search for antideutrons near the Earth.</description>

      <title>Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axion-like inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic calculation of the integrated double-emission eikonal function of a massive and a massless emitter whose momenta are at an arbitrary angle to each other. This quantity provides one of the required ingredients for extending the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme to processes with massive final-state particles. To calculate it, we use the standard methodology involving reverse unitarity and its extension to cases with Heaviside functions, integration-by-parts technology and reduction to master integrals, and differential equations. In addition, we also describe a semi-numerical method based on the subtraction of infra-red and collinear singularities from the eikonal function, allowing us to extract divergences of the integrated eikonal function analytically, and to derive a simple integral representation for the finite remainder.</description>

      <title>A Perturbatively Stable Non-Supersymmetric String Model with AdS Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of a perturbatively stable non-supersymmetric type II closed string model in four dimensions. It is based on a freely acting Scherk-Schwarz Z2-deformation of a supersymmetric construction which is recovered in appropriate decompactification limits. The model exhibits also the so-called misaligned supersymmetry with alternating signs for the number difference between bosons and fermions at successive mass levels. The tree-level spectrum is tachyon free for any value of the radii and moduli. At one loop level, the scalar potential has a non-supersymmetric minimum at the self-dual (free fermionic) point with negative energy, around which all tree-level massless scalars acquire positive masses. The model is thus non-supersymmetric and perturbatively stable.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We also find that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for FFI, which offers a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting FFI based solely on fluid properties. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>

      <title>Application of the Holographic Equation of State for Numerical Modeling of the Evolution of Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for numerical modeling of the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a holographic equation of state. Model's free parameters are calibrated using lattice results for quark masses approximating physical values and adjusted to match the Regge spectra of $\rho$ mesons. Numerical simulations are performed using the iEBE-MUSIC framework, which incorporates the MUSIC relativistic hydrodynamics solver. We modify the code by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model. Finally, the spectra of produced hadrons are computed using a hybrid iSS+UrQMD approach at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Speed Limit and Entanglement in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <title>Polish national input to the 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Polish high energy physics (HEP) community fully recognizes the urgent need to host at CERN a flagship project implementing a broad, long-term, and comprehensive vision of particle physics research and pursuing technological advances. Thus, we give preference and declare willingness to actively engage and participate in every aspect of the FCC project (both FCC-ee and FCC-hh), particularly accelerator development, detector construction, theoretical calculations, and physics analyses. As the e+e- Higgs Factory is the top priority for our field, the proposal to build a linear collider facility at CERN, opening up complementary physics prospects, should be considered as the second option.
  Polish teams declare strong support and are fully committed to contribute to the full exploitation of all aspects of the physics potential of the LHC and the HL-LHC programmes. To ensure the long-term development of particle physics, we also support the continuation of the high-field magnet research programme, as well as investigating other scenarios including, in particular, linear acceleration techniques and new acceleration technologies such as plasma acceleration, the muon collider and Gamma Factory. In addition, CERN should continue to provide support to fixed-target programmes at SPS as well as other non-collider and non-accelerator experiments at CERN. Participation in major projects conducted in and outside Europe should also be fostered.
  Education, communication, and outreach of particle physics are of paramount importance for the future of our field. An increased effort coordinated at the European level and resources allocated in all Member States are essential to effectively support future large-scale particle physics projects.</description>

      <title>Positive neutrino masses with DESI DR2 via matter conversion to dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a massively parallel spectroscopic survey on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, which has released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations determined from over 14 million extragalactic targets. We combine DESI Data Release 2 with CMB datasets to search for evidence of matter conversion to dark energy (DE), focusing on a scenario mediated by stellar collapse to cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH). In this physical model, which has the same number of free parameters as $\Lambda$CDM, DE production is determined by the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), allowing for distinct early- and late-time cosmologies. Using two SFRDs to bracket current observations, we find that the CCBH model: accurately recovers the cosmological expansion history, agrees with early-time baryon abundance measured by BBN, reduces tension with the local distance ladder, and relaxes constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$. For these SFRDs, we find a peaked positive $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.149\,\rm eV$ (95\% confidence) and $\sum m_\nu = 0.106^{+0.050}_{-0.069}\,\rm eV$ respectively, in good agreement with lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments. A peak in $\sum m_\nu &gt; 0$ results from late-time baryon consumption in the CCBH scenario and is expected to be a general feature of any model that converts sufficient matter to dark energy during and after reionization.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM: 5$\sigma$ Evidence for a Dynamical Dark Energy Late-Time Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy (DE), particularly in light of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements released by DESI survey. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong and statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition across various data combinations. \textit{The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\sim$5$\sigma$ in favor of a quintessence-phantom transition at $z_{\dag} = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}. Beyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z &lt; z_{\dag}$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication, \textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}.</description>

      <title>Static black hole horizons in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite previous results that rule out the possibility of a static black hole horizon in cosmology we present a black hole metric that has a static horizon whilst mimicking the cosmological behavior at large scales away from the black hole horizon. By a suitable choice of coordinates, we show that it is possible to have a static black hole horizon in cosmology that does not suffer from issues like singularities in curvature invariants at the horizon. The resulting metric is consistent with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for constant Hubble parameter. It should be noted that this metric does not lead to isotropic pressure, i.e. $p_\perp\neq p_r$ for radial distances comparable to Schwarzschild radius, but for large $r$ the stress tensor (assuming general relativity) tends to the cosmological value. Turning to a more realistic framework, we study the cases of black hole$+$cosmological matter and black hole$+$matter$+$cosmological constant where we assume the pressure component takes its cosmological value and show that although the resulting metric does not have a static horizon, the physical radius of the apparent horizon can tend to a constant value for large cosmological time. This metric does not suffer from issues like a singular horizon for asymptotically vanishing Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>Refined Predictions for Starobinsky Inflation and Post-inflationary Constraints in Light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a higher value for the spectral index $n_s$. This places Starobinsky inflation at the edge of the $2\sigma$ constraints for a number of e-folds $N_\star$ around $60$ when using the usual analytical approximations. We present refined predictions for Starobinsky inflation that go beyond the commonly used analytical approximations. By evaluating the model with these improved expressions, we show that for $N_\star \gtrsim 60$ it remains consistent with current observational constraints at the $2\sigma$ level. Additionally, we examine the implications of the ACT results for post-inflationary reheating parameters. Specifically, we find a lower bound on the effective equation of state parameter during reheating of approximately $\omega \gtrsim 0.462$; this excludes purely perturbative reheating, which leads to $\omega \simeq 0$. We also show that the reheating temperature is constrained to be $T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{12}~\text{GeV}$, assuming $\omega \leq 1$. Furthermore, we find that the predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within $1\sigma$ of the recent ACT constraints if the reheating temperature satisfies $4~\text{MeV} \lesssim T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 10~\text{GeV}$ for $0.8 \lesssim \omega \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and time-varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is parametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising from cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as well as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a fully-fledged string cosmology, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as kination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a time-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can be significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying tension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.</description>

      <title>In Situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter Using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits derived from early-universe observations.</description>

Abstract: Weakly interacting fermions with the Standard Model particles are promising candidates for the dark matter. In this paper, we study signatures of the gluonic interactions of a dark fermion and a neutrino at hadron colliders and direct detection experiments. The lowest order interactions are described by contact operators in dimension 7. At hadron colliders, the mono-jet production is the most sensitive channel. And these operators can also induce both spin-independent and spin-dependent absorption of the dark fermion at nuclear targets. We show that for a nearly massless dark fermion, the energy scales are constrained to be higher than 500 GeV and 1.2 TeV by the current LHC and HE-LHC searches, respectively. Furthermore, we also find that almost all the parameter space accessible by the spin-independent absorption has been excluded by the current LHC constraints. In contrast, for spin-dependent absorption at light nuclear targets there is still some parameter space which cannot be reached by current and upcoming LHC searches.</description>

      <title>Phasing out of Darkness: From Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter to Neutrino Masses via Time-Dependent Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are a compelling candidate for generating neutrino masses and for elucidating the nature of dark matter. Astrophysical X-ray constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter decays, however, largely exclude the active-sterile mixing required to produce simultaneously the correct left-handed neutrino spectrum and keV-scale right-handed neutrino dark matter within a type-I seesaw framework. In this study, we demonstrate how these X-ray constraints can be circumvented through a time-dependent approach, thereby reviving a broad range of active-sterile mixing scenarios. Our minimal model incorporates two right-handed neutrinos, which form a two-component dark matter candidate, and an auxiliary scalar field that experiences a very late and still ongoing phase transition, leading to the spontaneous breaking of a global $ U(1)_N $ symmetry. Prior to this phase transition, only the right-handed neutrinos are massive, while the left-handed neutrinos remain massless because of the scalar field's vanishing expectation value. As the phase transition develops, the growing expectation value of the scalar field increases the active-sterile mixing, thereby opening dark matter decay channels and inducing neutrino masses. The time dependence allows the scenario to be consistent with X-ray constraints as well as current measurements of left-handed neutrino masses. The anticipated level of active-sterile mixing today is within the detection capabilities of the forthcoming TRISTAN (KATRIN) tritium-beta decay project. Additionally, cosmological surveys such as DESI or EUCLID and supernova neutrino observations can test the prediction of massless left-handed neutrinos prior to the phase transition.</description>

Abstract: In an era increasingly focused on green computing and explainable AI, revisiting traditional approaches in theoretical and phenomenological particle physics is paramount. This project evaluates various machine learning (ML) algorithms-including Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and XGBoost-alongside standard neural networks and a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for physics data analysis. We apply these techniques to a binary classification task that distinguishes the experimental viability of simulated scenarios based on Higgs observables and essential parameters. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to showcase the capabilities and computational efficiency of each model in binary classification tasks, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse on integrating ML and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into physics research. In this study, XGBoost emerged as the preferred choice among the evaluated machine learning algorithms for its speed and effectiveness, especially in the initial stages of computation with limited datasets. However, while standard Neural Networks and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and adherence to physical laws, they require more computational time. These findings underscore the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model sophistication.</description>

      <title>The Quest for Understanding: The Case of the Upgraded Superconducting Super Collider</title>

Abstract: Fundamental particle physics is at a cross road. On the one hand the Standard Model successfully accounts for all experimental observations to date. On the other hand the ElectroWeak symmetry breaking mechanism is poorly understood and suggests the existence of new physics within reach of future colliders. Building on LHC experience, a hadron collider using the well established LHC magnet technology in a 90--100km circular ring, can reach the required 50--60TeV energy range and uncover the next layers of reality by the early 2040s.</description>

      <title>Precision evaluation of the $\eta$- and $\eta'$-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next to the $\pi^0$ pole, $\eta$ and $\eta'$ intermediate states give rise to the leading singularities of the hadronic light-by-light tensor, resulting in sizable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$. The strength of the poles is determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) to two (virtual) photons. We present a calculation of these TFFs that implements a number of low- and high-energy constraints, including the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to 2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, and asymptotic limits. Crucially, we investigate the role of the leading left-hand singularity generated by the exchange of the $a_2$ tensor meson, yielding, for the first time, an estimate of the associated factorization-breaking corrections. Our final results, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, conclude a dedicated effort to evaluate the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering using dispersion relations, amounting to a combined $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

Abstract: A stable numerical solution of the impact-parameter-dependent next-to-leading order Balitsky-Kovchegov equation is presented for the first time. The rapidity evolution of the dipole amplitude is discussed in detail. Dipole amplitude properties, such as the evolution speed or anomalous dimension behaviour, are studied as a function of the impact parameter and the dipole size and compared to solutions of the impact-parameter-dependent leading-order Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with the collinearly improved kernel. The next-to-leading evolution also strongly suppresses the Coulomb tails compared to the collinearly improved and leading order solutions.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: $\eta$ and $\eta'$ poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering are determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) into two virtual photons. These TFFs constitute complicated functions of the photon virtualities that, in turn, can be reconstructed in a dispersive approach from their discontinuities. In this work, we present such an analysis for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ TFFs, implementing a number of constraints from both experiment and theory: normalizations from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, unitarity constraints from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to 2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, singly-virtual data from $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\eta^{(\prime)}$, and the asymptotic behavior predicted by the light-cone expansion. In particular, we account for the leading left-hand-cut singularity by including effects from the $a_2$ resonance, necessitating the solution of an inhomogeneous Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es problem via a carefully chosen path deformation. The resulting TFFs allow us to evaluate the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-pole contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, completing a dedicated program for the lowest-lying pseudoscalar intermediate states in a dispersive approach to hadronic light-by-light scattering, $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) at the LHC in effective field theory, concentrating on $d=6$ operators with top quarks. Depending on the operator choice and HNL mass, the HNLs will be produced either from proton-proton collisions in association with a single top, or via non-standard decays of top quarks. For long-lived HNLs we estimate the sensitivity reach of different detectors to various operators with top quarks and the HNLs for the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. For certain operators, ATLAS and some far detectors (MATHUSLA and ANUBIS) will be able to probe the associated new-physics scale as large as 12 TeV and 4.5 TeV, respectively, covering complementary HNL-mass ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to the left-right symmetric model $SU(3)_c \times SU(3)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ with C-parity also unbroken [$C$ converts $Q\to -Q$, where $Q$ is the electric charge operator in $SO(10)$.] This breaking produces the topologically stable GUT monopole as well as a GUT scale C-string. The subsequent breaking at an intermediate scale of C-parity produces domain walls bounded by C-strings, found by Kibble, Lazarides and Shafi. A limited number of inflationary $e$-foldings experienced during these breakings can yield an observable number density of primordial GUT monopoles. The C-strings also experience this inflationary phase, and the subsequent string-wall network decays through the emission of gravitational waves. We estimate the gravitational wave spectrum from these composite structures over a range of values of the domain wall tension $\sigma$. Depending on $\sigma$ the spectrum displays a peak in the higher frequency range between $10^2$ to $10^5$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and nonzero baryon chemical potential. In this article, we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of hardon resonance gas models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>

      <title>Testing the Gallium anomaly using Electron-Neutrino Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gallium anomaly is an unexplained deficit in the neutrinos observed during the calibration of GALLEX and SAGE using a $^{51}$Cr radioactive source and recently confirmed by BEST. The possible explanations for this deficit include an overestimation of the neutrino absorption cross section in Ga, an incorrect measurement of the source activity or the existence of sterile neutrinos. However, as this deficit has only been observed in Ga detectors, it has not been possible to distinguish among various proposals. Therefore, we propose an experiment using the same radioactive source but with a different detection method, electron-neutrino scattering. We discuss potential locations for such an experiment, estimating the main backgrounds and expected event rates, considering various target masses and source positions. Even if the anomaly does not result from the detection method, such an experiment can provide an independent determination of the branching ratio of the $^{51}$Cr decay by using the spectral information or observing the scattering angle. It is also sensitive to an eventual baseline dependence of the anomaly, as is predicted in sterile neutrino models.</description>

      <title>Factorization Formula Connecting the Shape Functions of Heavy Meson in QCD and Heavy Quark Effective Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shape function of $B$-meson defined in heavy quark effective theory (HQET) plays a crucial role in the analysis of inclusive $B$ decays, and constitutes one of the dominant uncertainties in the determination of CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$. On the other hand, the conventional heavy meson shape function defined in QCD is also phenomenologically important and includes shortdistance physics at energy scales of the heavy quark mass. In this work, we derived a factorization formula relating these two kinds of shape functions, which can be invoked to fully disentangle the effects from disparate scales $m_b$ and $\Lambda_{\textrm{QCD}}$, particularly to facilitate the resummation of logarithms $\ln m_b/\Lambda_{\textrm{QCD}}$. In addition, this factorization constitutes an essential component of the recently developed two-step factorization scheme, enabling lattice QCD calculations of lightcone quantities of heavy meson. The results presented here pave the way for first-principles nonperturbative predictions of shape function in the near future.</description>

      <title>The moat regimes within $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-Quark-Meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better understand recent predictions on the moat regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter, this paper extends the previous work within the two-flavor Quark-Meson (QM) model to the more realistic $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-Quark-Meson (PQM) model. Mainly, two effects are further taken into account: strange quark and confinement coded through Polyakov loop. Model parameters are chosen to consistently reproduce the pseudo-critical temperature from lattice QCD, $T_{\rm C}\sim 156~ {\rm MeV}$, and the baryon chemical potential at the critical end point (CEP) from FRG-QCD, $\mu_{\rm B(CEP)}\sim 635~ {\rm MeV}$. It is found that the basic features of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons remain similar to those from QM model: Moat regimes cover the region where temperature or baryon chemical potential is large; reentrances occur around the critical baryon chemical potential of chiral transition at zero temperature. Thus, the FRG-QCD results can still not be well understood, especially why the CEP should locate at the entrances of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons. Nevertheless, some basic features can be understood qualitatively, and it is consistent that the pole energies are increasing functions of momenta in the whole $T-\mu_{\rm B}$ plane. The moat regime and pole energy of $K$ mesons are also studied with the features similar.</description>

      <title>Seeding Supermassive Black Holes with Self-Interacting Dark Matter: A Unified Scenario with Baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.15132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations show that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with a mass of $\sim10^9 M_\odot$ exist when the Universe is just $6\%$ of its current age. We propose a scenario where a self-interacting dark matter halo experiences gravothermal instability and its central region collapses into a seed black hole. The presence of baryons in protogalaxies could significantly accelerate the gravothermal evolution of the halo and shorten collapse timescales. The central halo could dissipate its angular momentum remnant via viscosity induced by the self-interactions. The host halo must be on high tails of density fluctuations, implying that high-$z$ SMBHs are expected to be rare in this scenario. We further derive conditions for triggering general relativistic instability of the collapsed region. Our results indicate that self-interacting dark matter can provide a unified explanation for diverse dark matter distributions in galaxies today and the origin of SMBHs at redshifts $z\sim6-7$.</description>

      <title>Exact treatment of weak dark matter-baryon scattering for linear-cosmology observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastic scattering of dark matter (DM) particles with baryons induce cosmological signals that may be detectable with modern or future telescopes. For DM-baryon scattering cross sections scaling with negative powers of relative velocity, $\sigma_{\chi b}(v) \propto v^{-2}, v^{-4}$, such interactions introduce a momentum-exchange rate that is nonlinear in DM-baryon bulk relative velocities, thus not amenable for inclusion as-is into standard linear cosmological Boltzmann codes. Linear ansatzes have been adopted in past works, but their accuracy is unknown as they do not arise from first-principles derivations. In this work, for the first time, we construct a rigorous framework for computing linear-cosmology observables as a perturbative expansion in $\sigma_{\chi b}$. We argue that this approach is accurate for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) angular power spectra when most or all of the DM is scattering with baryons with cross section $\sigma_{\chi b}(v) \propto v^{-2}, v^{-4}$. We derive exact formal expressions for CMB power spectra at linear order in $\sigma_{\chi b}$, and show that they only depend on a specific velocity integral of the momentum-exchange rate. Consequently, we can obtain the exact power spectra at linear order in $\sigma_{\chi b}$ by substituting the original nonlinear momentum-exchange rate with a uniquely specified linear rate. Serendipitously, we find that the exact substitution we derive from first principles precisely coincides with the most widely used linear ansatz, thus placing previous CMB-anisotropy upper bounds on a more solid footing. In addition to finally providing an exact cosmological solution to the DM-baryon scattering problem in a well-defined region of parameter space, the framework we construct opens the way to computing higher-order correlation functions, beyond power spectra, which are promising yet unexplored probes of DM-baryon scattering.</description>

Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the infrared on-shell action of Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, obtaining an effective, gauge-invariant boundary action for memory and shockwave spacetimes. We show that the phase space is in both cases parameterized by the leading soft variables in asymptotically flat spacetimes, thereby extending the equivalence between shockwave and soft commutators to spacetimes with non-vanishing Bondi mass. We then demonstrate that our on-shell action is equal to three quantities studied separately in the literature: $(i)$ the soft supertranslation charge; $(ii)$ the shockwave effective action, or equivalently the modular Hamiltonian; and $(iii)$ the soft effective action. Finally, we compute the quantum fluctuations in the soft supertranslation charge and, assuming the supertranslation parameter may be promoted to an operator, we obtain an area law, consistent with earlier results showing that the modular Hamiltonian has such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Spectrum of Non-Newtonian Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework to study homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in a viscoelastic fluid, regarded as a perturbation of a Newtonian incompressible fluid, where the fluid relaxation time, or else the Weissenberg number, plays the role of small parameter. We use a Martin-Siggia-Rose framework to obtain a formal expression for the velocity correlation function of the non-Newtonian flow, and we expand this formal expression to linear order in the relaxation time. The coefficients in this expansion are correlation functions of the base Newtonian flow. We do not derive these correlations, instead we replace them by their values according to K41 theory, which could be regarded as an extreme form of renormalization. While substantial work will be necessary to validate the model against numerical and experimental data, preliminary results are encouraging.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all - Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>Polarization Characteristics of the Hyperactive FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio bursts of extragalactic origin characterized by millisecond durations and high luminosities. We report on observations of FRB 20240114A conducted with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at frequencies ranging from 720 to 920 MHz. A total of 437 bursts were detected, with a single observation recording 365 bursts over 1.38 hours, corresponding to a burst rate of 264 bursts per hour. The average rotation measures (RMs) were $347.0 \pm 1.0$ rad m$^{-2}$ on February 23, 2024, and $353.7 \pm 0.6$ rad m$^{-2}$ on March 1, 2024. Of the 301 bursts with detected RMs, 81% have a linear polarization fraction greater than 90%, and 14% exhibit circular polarization with a signal-to-noise ratio $&gt; 5$. Our sample also displayed polarization angle swings. We compared the linear polarization fraction of FRB~20240114A with those of the repeating sources FRB~20201124A and FRB~20220912A. Our analysis reveals that all three exhibit similar distributions in both linear and circular polarization fractions. These results indicate that the three sources share the same radiation mechanism. We analyze the fluence and waiting-time distributions of FRB~20240114A, revealing a right-skewed fluence distribution and a bimodal waiting-time structure, suggesting intrinsic emission timescales and potential multiple burst populations. Additionally, We present a novel method to determine the frequency range of bursts based on their spectral characteristics. This algorithm is independent of spectral models and remains unaffected by the removal of interference-affected channels in the data, ensuring robust performance.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Differential High-Frequency Lock-In Probe for Laser-Induced Vacuum Birefringence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of laser-induced vacuum birefringence through the use of pulsed lasers coupled to femtosecond optical enhancement cavities. This measurement technique features cavity-enhanced pump and probe pulses, as well as an independent control pulse. The control pulse allows for a differential measurement where the final signal is obtained using high-frequency lock-in detection, greatly mitigating time-dependent cavity birefringence as an important and possibly prohibitive systematic effect. In addition, the method features the economical use of laser power, and results in a relatively simple experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: To be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these are compared with results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Extracting more information from entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Schwinger Quantization for Emergent Magnetic Monopoles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Refs.[1-4] Dirac and Schwinger showed the existence of a magnetic monopole required a charge quantization condition which we write following Dirac as $\frac{eg}{4\pi\hbar}=\frac{n}{2},\; n=0,\pm 1,\; \pm 2, \ldots$. Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs. [5,6], it has been shown experimentally that frustrated spin-ice systems exhibit 'emergent' magnetic monopoles. We show that, within the experimental errors, the respective magnetic charges obey the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition. Possible implications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Results are presented of searches and measurements in the top quark sector by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. These analyses use data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, recorded during Run 2 at the Large Hadron Collider and corresponding to integrated luminosities of 138-140 fb$^{-1}$. Searches are carried out for charged lepton flavour violation, baryon number violation and the presence of neutral heavy leptons. A precise measurement of lepton flavour universality between electrons and muons originating from top quark-antiquark events is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI DR2 BAO: A 2$\sigma$+ Detection of Non-zero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent DESI Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release (PR) 4) and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR) 6) data, uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1) data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\textrm{eff}}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\textrm{lens}}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL, we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a non-zero $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a $\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy inconclusive, contrary to claims by DESI collaboration. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\textrm{lens}} = 1$ is excluded at $&gt;2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL data - suggesting for the first time that the existence of lensing anomaly may depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$ with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.</description>
