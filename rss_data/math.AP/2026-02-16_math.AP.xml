      <title>Global renormalized solutions for hard potential non-cutoff Boltzmann equation without defect measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of global renormalized solutions to the Boltzmann equation with long-range interactions without angular cutoff was first established by Alexandre and Villani [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 55(1), 30-70, 2002]. Their result relies on a definition of renormalized solutions involving a non-negative defect measure. In this paper, we address this issue for the inverse power law model in the case of hard potentials ($0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$). By exploiting the stronger coercivity estimates provided by hard potentials, we prove that the defect measure actually vanishes. Consequently, we establish the global existence of renormalized solutions for the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation with hard potentials in the standard sense, without any defect measure. Finally, we construct a counterexample showing that the approach developed for the hard potential case fails for soft potential model ($-3 &lt; \gamma &lt; 0$).</description>

      <title>Asymptotically self-similar graph-like solutions to a multi-dimensional surface diffusion flow equation under contact angle and no-flux boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies Mullins' model of thermal grooving which consists of a surface diffusion flow equation with contact angle and no-flux boundary conditions. We consider this problem in a multi-dimensional half space and prove that if the slope of the initial data is close to that consistent with the contact angle, then there exists a unique global-in-time solution. In particular, we show the existence of a self-similar solution for a given behavior at the space infinity. We also show that our global solution converges to a self-similar solution as the time tends to infinity if the initial data is asymptotically homogeneous at the space infinity. No assumption on the size of the contact angle is imposed.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability for quasilinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the stability of a class of quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations under perturbations. We are interested in the behavior of viscosity solutions as the perturbation parameter vanishes and establish explicit convergence rates by adapting standard comparison arguments. Despite the possible singular or degenerate nature of the parabolic operator, our framework covers, in particular, both the normalized and the variational $p$-parabolic equations, providing quantitative estimates for perturbations of the exponent $p$ and limits arising from regularized approximations.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations from almost the same initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) which can give very accurate spatiotemporal trajectory of Navier-Stokes turbulence in a finite but long enough interval of time, we give some numerical evidences that the Navier-Stokes equations admit distinct global solutions from almost the same initial conditions whose difference is very small, i.e. even at the order $10^{-40}$ of magnitude. Hopefully these examples could provide some enlightenments for the uniqueness and existence of Navier-Stokes equations, which are related to one Millennium Prize Problem of Clay Institute.</description>

      <title>New solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equations in Coulomb-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and multiplicity results for the nonlinear and nonlocal PDE $$ - \Delta u + (I_\alpha \star |u|^p)\, |u|^{p-2}\, u = f(|x|,u) \quad \textrm{in} \,\,\mathbb {R}^N, $$ where $N \geq 2$, $I_\alpha : \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the Riesz potential of order $\alpha \in (1,N),$ $p&gt;1,$ and the local nonlinearity $f: [0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is subject to a new class of assumptions. We find solutions to this zero-mass problem in a Coulomb-Sobolev space using a new scaling based approach in critical point theory, by which we classify the possibly different behaviour of the nonlinearity $f$ at zero and at infinity in terms of the scaling properties of the left hand side of the equation. This is accomplished identifying a scaling invariant PDE which can be interpreted as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, for which a sequence of eigenvalues $\{\lambda_k\}$ is conveniently defined via the ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$-cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz. This index allows us to use new critical group estimates (and scaling-based linking sets) which might not be possible via the classical genus. Within a fairly broad set of parameters $N,\alpha, p$ and class of assumptions on the local nonlinearity $f,$ we establish compactness results for an associated action functional and find multiple solutions as critical points, whose existence and number is sensitive to the ''resonance'' of $f$ with the sequence of eigenvalues for the scaling invariant problem, a construction which is at places reminiscent, in the present nonlinear setting, of the classical Fredholm alternative. As a byproduct of our analysis, letting $p\neq 2$ allows us to capture general nonlinearities $f$ of Sobolev-subcritical, critical, or supercritical growth.</description>

      <title>A new model for two-layer liquid-gas stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new model for immiscible two-layer gas-liquid stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections. The bottom layer is occupied by an incompressible fluid in liquid phase with hydrodynamics based on a hydrostatic pressure, following a shallow water approximation. The top layer is occupied by a compressible gas, following an ideal gas law leading to conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two subsystems are linked through non-conservative products, representing momentum and energy exchanges between layers. The hyperbolic properties of the resulting model are analyzed, including the derivation of entropy inequalities, and the approximations of eigenvalues of the corresponding coefficient matrix. Numerical tests are included to demonstrate the merits of the model and the numerical approximations, including well-balancedness, Riemann problems, and perturbations and convergence toward steady states at rest. Besides simulations of water and air where the density difference between layers is significant, a case where such difference is not so pronounced (like gas and liquid hydrogen) is also shown.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics and defect expansions for polynomial PDEs on thin annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric and analytic framework for polynomial partial differential equations posed on thin annuli in the plane. Using renormalized Sobolev inner products, we construct Sobolev orthogonal polynomial bases adapted to the thin geometry and use them to define stable Galerkin approximations.
  We prove a general dimension-reduction theorem for polynomial Hamiltonian and dissipative PDEs, showing that solutions converge to effective one-dimensional dynamics on the limiting circle. Beyond the leading-order limit, we identify transverse defect correctors and derive cell problems describing anisotropic dispersive and homogenized effects.
  Our framework applies uniformly to integrable models (KdV, modified KdV, nonlinear Schr\"odinger, sine--Gordon), anisotropic dispersive systems such as Zakharov--Kuznetsov, and non-integrable perturbations including dissipation, forcing, and rapidly oscillating coefficients. We establish stability of the effective dynamics under changes of Sobolev order and of polynomial Hilbert geometry, and show robustness of the associated Galerkin schemes.
  The results provide a unified geometric perspective on dimension reduction, homogenization, and integrability in thin geometries, and introduce Sobolev orthogonal polynomial methods as a constructive tool for multiscale PDE analysis.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to the Nirenberg Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Nirenberg Neural Network: a numerical approach to the Nirenberg problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on $S^2$ for metrics that are pointwise conformal to the round metric. Our mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach directly parametrises the conformal factor globally and is trained with a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation. Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.
  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones. The current capabilities of the Nirenberg Neural Network demonstrate that neural solvers can serve as exploratory tools in geometric analysis, offering a quantitative computational perspective on longstanding existence questions.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of Radon transforms over quadric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the microlocal properties of generalized Radon transforms over a family of quadric hypersurfaces whose centers lie on an orientable hypersurface $S$. The quadric surfaces we consider are level sets of the quadratic form associated to a symmetric, invertible matrix $A$, with real entries. We study the singularities of the right and left projections of the canonical relation associated with these operators and show that they are determined by the signature of the matrix $A$ and the hypersurface $S$. If the matrix is positive/negative definite (i.e., the surface of integration is an ellipsoid) and $S$ is strictly convex, we prove that the singularities are folds. If the matrix is indefinite (i.e., the surface of integration is a hyperboloid-type quadric) and $S$ is either strictly convex or a cylinder, then cusp, fold, or blowdown singularities are present. We also study the case when the surface of integration is a paraboloid and show that the Bolker condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Proving periodic solutions and branches in the 2D Swift Hohenberg PDE with hexagonal and triangular symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we enforce space group symmetries in Fourier series to rigorously prove the existence of smooth, periodic solutions in partial differential equations (PDEs) with hexagonal and triangular symmetries. In particular, we provide the necessary analytical and numerical tools to construct Fourier series of functions on the hexagonal lattice. This allows one to build approximate solutions that are periodic. Moreover, to generate the periodic tiling, we can use one symmetric hexagon for $D_6$ symmetry and two symmetric triangles for $D_3$ symmetry. We derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse around an approximate solution, $\overline{u}$. More specifically, we verify a condition based on the computation of explicit bounds. The strategy for constructing $\overline{u}$, the approximate inverse, and the computation of these bounds will be presented. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving the existence of $D_3$ and $D_6$ periodic solutions. We then perform proofs of branches of solutions by using Chebyshev series. The algorithmic details to perform the proof can be found on Github.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cost of fast controls for a linearized KdV system and a nonlinear KdV system locally, using right Neumann boundary control for non-critical lengths. Since the operator associated with the linearized system is neither self-adjoint nor skew-adjoint, its (known) spectral properties are not directly amenable to the moment method, leaving optimal cost bounds an open problem. We address this difficulty by shifting attention to a related KdV system and deriving the optimal bounds from the new one.</description>

      <title>Learning functional components of PDEs from data using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations often contain unknown functions that are difficult or impossible to measure directly, hampering our ability to derive predictions from the model. Workflows for recovering scalar PDE parameters from data are well studied: here we show how similar workflows can be used to recover functions from data. Specifically, we embed neural networks into the PDE and show how, as they are trained on data, they can approximate unknown functions with arbitrary accuracy. Using nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations as a case study, we recover interaction kernels and external potentials from steady state data. Specifically, we investigate how a wide range of factors, such as the number of available solutions, their properties, sampling density, and measurement noise, affect our ability to successfully recover functions. Our approach is advantageous because it can utilise standard parameter-fitting workflows, and in that the trained PDE can be treated as a normal PDE for purposes such as generating system predictions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the vacuum Einstein field equations under the Belinski-Zakharov symmetry, which leaves the problem as a 1+1-dimensional quasilinear system of PDEs. Depending on the chosen signature of the metric, these spacetimes contain most of the well-known special solutions in General Relativity. In this paper, {\color{blue} we consider the case of cosmological metrics, in the Belinsky-Zakharov notation}, and prove global existence of small Belinski-Zakharov spacetimes under a natural nondegeneracy condition. We also construct new energies and virial functionals to provide a description of the energy decay of smooth global cosmological metrics inside the light cone. Finally, some applications are presented in the case {\color{blue} of the particular metrics called} generalized Kasner solitons.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of nonsingular solitons of the Principal Chiral Field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Principal Chiral Field model posed in 1+1 dimensions into the Lie group $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$. In this work we show the nonlinear stability of small enough nonsingular solitons. The method of proof involves the use of vector field methods as in a previous work by the second and third authors dealing with the Einstein's field equations under the Belinski-Zakharov formalism, extending for all times the size of suitable null weighted norms of the perturbations at time zero.</description>

      <title>The steady state of gravity-capillary problem with inclined walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravity-capillary problem with inclined walls is a problem that describes an open fluid flowing over an angled wall. It has broad applications in science and engineering. In this paper, we study the steady states of the two-dimensional inclined-wall problem. The steady-state configurations are characterized as solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equation associated with a prescribed energy functional, subject to a fixed contact-angle boundary condition. By parameterizing the free surface using an appropriately chosen maximal point, we construct solutions to this Euler-Lagrange equation via a shooting method, with the fluid volume serving as the shooting parameter. The construction is valid for arbitrary contact angles and arbitrary inclined angles of the walls.</description>

      <title>Iterative methods fail to solve NLS below the Sobolev embedding threshold on the Sierpinski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the Sierpinski gasket with a power nonlinearity of order $2k{+}1$ is not locally well-posed for initial data just below the regularity threshold for the Sobolev embedding $H^s\subseteq L^\infty$. More precisely, the flow map fails to be $C^{2k+1}$-continuous in any Sobolev space $H^s$ below that threshold, and the threshold is independent of the power nonlinearity. This novel behavior significantly differs from other compact spaces such as the torus or the sphere, and it is directly connected to the existence of localized eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in multiply periodic materials with fine microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Cahn-Hilliard model for phase separation in composite materials with multiple periodic microstructures. These are modeled by considering a highly oscillating potential. The focus of this paper is in the case where the scales of the microstructures are smaller than that of phase separation. We provide a compactness result and prove that the {\Gamma}-limit of the energy is a multiple of the perimeter. In particular, using the recently introduced unfolding operator for multiple scales, we show that the taking the limit of all of the scales together is equivalent to taking one limit at the time, starting from the smaller scale and keeping the larger fixed.</description>

      <title>Large torus limit of global dynamics of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model (DAM), i.e. the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative spatial white noise. For this model, global well-posedness on the periodic domain was established by Visciglia and the second author (2023), and global well-posedness on the full space was established by Debussche, Visciglia, and the authors (2024). We show that, under suitable initial conditions and suitable periodization procedure of the noise, the periodic global dynamics of the DAM converges in spaces of local domains to that of the DAM on the full space as the period goes to infinity. In order to control the growth of the noise and obtain a priori bounds for solutions independent of the periodicity, we introduce periodic weights and construct weighted function spaces on periodic domains. In Appendix, we also discuss the same problem for the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>On the hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential in a phase field tumor growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a phase field model for a tumor growth model of Cahn--Hilliard type in which the often assumed parabolic relaxation of the chemical potential is replaced by a hyperbolic one. We show that the resulting initial-boundary value problem is well posed and that its solutions depend continuously on two given functions: one appearing in the mass balance equation and one in the nutrient equation, representing, respectively, sources of drugs (e.g. chemotherapy) and antiangiogenic therapy. We also discuss regularity properties of the solutions. Moreover, in the case of a constant proliferation function, we rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior as the coefficient of the inertial term tends to zero, establishing convergence to the corresponding viscous Cahn--Hilliard tumor growth model. Our results apply to a broad class of double-well potentials, including nonsmooth ones.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic formulas for phase recovering from phaseless data of biharmonic waves at a fixed frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on phase retrieval from phaseless total-field data in biharmonic scattering problems. We prove that a phased biharmonic wave can be uniquely determined by the modulus of the total biharmonic wave within a nonempty domain. As a direct corollary, the uniqueness for the inverse biharmonic scattering problem with phaseless total-field data is established. Moreover, using the Atkinson-type asymptotic expansion, we derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the problem of phase retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Ginzburg-Landau equation correctly predicts the dynamics of quasilinear pattern-forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems, close to the first instability. We present a simple theorem which is easily applicable for such systems and relies on key maximal regularity results. The theorem is applied to the Gray-Scott-Klausmeier vegetation-water interaction model and its application to general reaction-diffusion-advection systems is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the past nonlinear stability of the sub-critical Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations on a truncated cone domain in spacetime dimensions $n\geq4$. Our analysis demonstrates that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete in the contracting direction and terminate at quiescent and crushing singularities characterized by the blow-up of curvature invariants. This work generalizes the result of Beyer-Oliynyk-Zheng in [arXiv:2502.09210v2] to all higher dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Potential trace inequalities via a Calder\'on-type theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a general theoretical tool for the establishment of the boundedness of notoriously difficult operators (such as potentials) on certain specific types of rearrangement-invariant function spaces from analogous properties of operators that are easier to handle (such as fractional maximal operators). A principal example of the new results one obtains by our analysis is the following inequality, which generalizes a result of Korobkov and Kristensen (who had treated the case $\mu=\mathcal{L}^n$, the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$): There exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that \[\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |I_\alpha^\mu f|^p d\nu \leq C \|f\|_{L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)}^p\] for all $f$ in the Lorentz space $L^{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mu)$, where $\mu, \nu$ are Radon measures such that \[\sup_{Q} \frac{\mu(Q)}{l(Q)^{d}} &lt; \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_{\mu(Q)&gt;0} \frac{\nu(Q)}{\quad\mu(Q)^{1-\frac{\alpha p}{d}}} &lt; \infty,\] and $I_\alpha^\mu$ is the Riesz potential defined with respect to $\mu$ of order $\alpha \in (0,d)$. More broadly, we obtain inequalities in this spirit in the context of rearrangement-invariant spaces through a result of independent interest, an extension of an interpolation theorem of Calder\'on where the target space in one endpoint is a space of bounded functions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the liquid drop model with a positive background density in the thermodynamic limit. We prove a two-term asymptotics for the ground state energy per unit volume in the dilute limit. Our proof justifies the expectation that optimal configurations consist of droplets of unit size that arrange themselves according to minimizers for the Jellium problem for point particles. In particular, we provide the first rigorous derivation of what is known as the gnocchi phase in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for stochastic differential equations in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a versatile framework to study strong existence and uniqueness for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift. We consider an SDE in a separable Hilbert space $H$ \begin{equation*} dX_t= (A X_t + b(X_t))dt +(-A)^{-\gamma/2}dW_t,\quad X_0=x_0 \in H, \end{equation*} where $A$ is a self-adjoint negative definite operator with purely atomic spectrum, $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process, $b$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function $H\to H$, and a nonnegative parameter $\gamma$ such that the stochastic convolution takes values in $H$. We show that this equation has a unique strong solution provided that $\alpha &gt; \alpha^*(\gamma)$, with an explicit function $\alpha^*$ that takes values in $(0,1)$ for all $\gamma\in[0,3)$. This substantially extends the seminal work of Da Prato and Flandoli (2010) as no structural assumption on $b$ is imposed. The range of admissible $\alpha$ is also extended. To obtain this result, we do not use infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations but instead develop a new technique combining L\^e's theory of stochastic sewing in Hilbert spaces, Gaussian analysis, and a method of Lasry and Lions for approximation in Hilbert spaces.</description>
