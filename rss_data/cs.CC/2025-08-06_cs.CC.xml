      <title>Polynomial-time sampling despite disorder chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distribution over instances of a sampling problem is said to exhibit transport disorder chaos if perturbing the instance by a small amount of random noise dramatically changes the stationary distribution (in Wasserstein distance). Seeking to provide evidence that some sampling tasks are hard on average, a recent line of work has demonstrated that disorder chaos is sufficient to rule out "stable" sampling algorithms, such as gradient methods and some diffusion processes.
  We demonstrate that disorder chaos does not preclude polynomial-time sampling by canonical algorithms in canonical models. We show that with high probability over a random graph $\boldsymbol{G} \sim G(n,1/2)$: (1) the hardcore model (at fugacity $\lambda = 1$) on $\boldsymbol{G}$ exhibits disorder chaos, and (2) Glauber dynamics run for $O(n)$ time can approximately sample from the hardcore model on $\boldsymbol{G}$ (in Wasserstein distance).</description>

      <title>A 60-Addition, Rank-23 Scheme for Exact 3x3 Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reduce the additive cost of general (non-commutative) 3x3 matrix multiplication from the previous records of 61 (Schwartz-Vaknin, 2023) and 62 (Martensson-Wagner, 2025) to 60 without a change of basis. To our knowledge, this represents a new state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description>

      <title>Membership and Conjugacy in Inverse Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The membership problem for an algebraic structure asks whether a given element is contained in some substructure, which is usually given by generators. In this work we study the membership problem, as well as the conjugacy problem, for finite inverse semigroups. The closely related membership problem for finite semigroups has been shown to be PSPACE-complete in the transformation model by Kozen (1977) and NL-complete in the Cayley table model by Jones, Lien, and Laaser (1976). In the partial bijection model, the membership and the conjugacy problem for finite inverse semigroups were shown to be PSPACE-complete by Birget and Margolis (2008) and by Jack (2023).
  Here we present a more detailed analysis of the complexity of the membership and conjugacy problems parametrized by varieties of finite inverse semigroups. We establish dichotomy theorems for the partial bijection model and for the Cayley table model. In the partial bijection model these problems are in NC (resp. NP for conjugacy) for strict inverse semigroups and PSPACE-complete otherwise. In the Cayley table model we obtain general LOGSPACE-algorithms as well as NPOLYLOGTIME upper bounds for Clifford semigroups and LOGSPACE-completeness otherwise.
  Furthermore, by applying our findings, we show the following: the intersection non-emptiness problem for inverse automata is PSPACE-complete even for automata with only two states; the subpower membership problem is in NC for every strict inverse semi-group and PSPACE-complete otherwise; the minimum generating set and the equation satisfiability problems are in NP for varieties of finite strict inverse semigroups and PSPACE-complete otherwise.</description>
