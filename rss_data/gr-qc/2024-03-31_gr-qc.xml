      <title>Conservative wormholes in generalized $\kappa(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})$-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive study of wormhole configurations in $\kappa(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})$ gravity with linear and non-linear functions. The model assumed Morrison-Thorne spacetime where the redshift and shape functions linked with the matter contain and geometry of the spacetime through non-covariant conservation equation of the stress-energy tensor. The first solution was explored assuming a constant redshift function that leads to a wormhole (WH) which is asymptotically non-flat. The remaining solutions were explored in two cases. Firstly, assuming a linear equation of state $p(r)=\omega \rho(r)$ along with different forms of $\kappa(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})-$function. This proved enough to derive a shape function of the form $b(r)=r_{0}\left(\frac{r_{0}}{r}\right)^{1/\omega}$. Secondly, by assuming specific choices of the shape function consistent with the wormhole configuration requirements. All the solutions fulfill flare-out condition, asymptotically flat and supported by phantom energy. Further, the embedding surface and its revolution has been generated using numerical method to see how the length of the throat is affected of the coupling parameters through $\kappa(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})$ function. At the end, we have also calculated the average null energy condition, which is satisfied by all the WH models signifying minimum exotic matter is required to open the WH throats.</description>

      <title>Impenetrable Barriers in the Phase Space of a Particle Around a Kerr Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase space of a particle in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric from a geometrical perceptive. In particular, we show the construction of a multidimensional generalization of the unstable periodic orbits and their stable and unstable invariant manifolds that direct the dynamics in the phase space. Those stable and unstable invariant manifolds divide the phase space and are robust under perturbations. To visualize the multidimensional invariant sets under the flow in the phase space, we use a method based on the arclength of the trajectories in phase space.</description>

      <title>Rotating galactic black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galactic black hole is a supermassive black hole located at the center of a galaxy surrounded by a dark matter halo. For the first time, we establish a generic, fully-relativistic formalism to calculate solutions of Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to an anisotropic fluid modeled by the Einstein cluster in axisymmetric, non-vacuum spacetimes, which are extensions of spherically-symmetric cases. These asymptotically flat spacetimes with regular horizons can describe the geometry of galaxies harboring supermassive black holes and are useful to constrain the environment surrounding astrophysical black holes. Our findings provide a solid groundwork for future studies on the shadows, quasi-normal modes, and other phenomena associated with rotating galactic black holes.</description>

      <title>Research on high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in generalized black-bounce spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solve problem of spacetime singularity in theoretical physics, researchers proposed the regular black holes (BH). The generalized black-bounce (GBB) spacetime, as a unified treatment of distinct kinds of geometries in the framework of general relativity (e.g. regular BH and wormholes), has been extensively studied. Firstly, we derive to give the explicit forms of Lagrangian for a nonlinear electromagnetic field and potential for a non-canonical phantom field in the action of gravitational system corresponding to GBB solution. Secondly, this paper computes the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the stable circular orbit region for different types of celestial bodies in GBB spacetime. The research suggests that traversable wormholes may have two ISCOs or one ISCO depending on the throat's scale, whereas regular BH and extremal BH possess only one ISCO. Thirdly, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been found to be a reliable tool for testing gravitational theories. Therefore, we compute the radial and azimuthal epicyclic angular frequencies of particles oscillating on stable circular orbits around various celestial bodies and compare them with the oscillation frequency properties of schwarzschild BH. Moreover, due to the limited amount of research on the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) phenomenon and its generation mechanisms around particles near wormholes using observational data, this paper aims to study theoretical models that can simultaneously describe both BH and wormholes by fitting observational data. Using resonance models and associated frequency ratios, we are able to locate the resonances of different celestial bodies within the GBB spacetime.</description>

      <title>Stupendously Large Black Hole Coalescence and Hubble Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local and distant measurements of the Hubble constant are in significant tension: local measurements of the Hubble constant appear to show a Universe that is significantly contracted when compared to distant measurements. From the point of view of an observer, a passing gravitational wave could cause the Universe to appear locally contracted and expanded in a quadrupolar pattern. The inspiral of a pair of stupendously large black holes (SLABs) with a chirp mass of $\sim10^{21}~\rm{M}_\odot$ may produce gravitational radiation with sufficiently large amplitude and wavelength to increase $H_0$ in one direction, and decrease it by the same amount in the other. These tensions would then oscillate with a period corresponding to half the orbital period of the binary. If such a gravitational wave were aligned with the plane of the Milky Way, most readily visible galaxies would appear closer than they actually are, thereby causing the apparent Hubble tension. Due to the long binary period, we would be in the same phase of the gravitational wave for the complete history of astronomical observation. The opposite tension would be visible in the orthogonal directions, thus giving the opportunity to falsify the existence of inspiraling SLAB binaries. As a corollary, the Hubble tension may place an upper limit on the maximum mass of inspiraling black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Influence of pressure anisotropy and non-metricity parameter on mass-radius relation and stability of millisecond pulsar in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we explore the astrophysical implications of pressure anisotropy on the physical characteristics of millisecond pulsars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. Starting off with the field equations for anisotropic matter distributions, we adopt the physically salient Durgapal-Fuloria ansatz together with a well-motivated anisotropic factor for the interior matter distribution. This leads to a nonlinear second order differential equation which is integrated to give the complete gravitational and thermodynamical properties of the stellar object. The resulting model is subjected to rigorous tests to ensure that it qualifies as a physically viable compact object within the $f(Q)$-gravity framework. We study in detail two factors, one being non-metricity (gravitational interaction) and the other the pressure anisotropy (matter variation) and their contributions to the mass, radius and stability of the star. Our analyses indicate that our models are well-behaved, singularity-free and can account for the existence of a wide range of observed pulsars with masses ranging from 2.08 to 2.67 $M_{\odot}$, with the upper value being in the so-called {\em mass gap} regime observed in gravitational events such as GW190814. A novel finding of this work is two-fold: an increase in the non-metricity factor (fixed anisotropy) leads to a spectrum of pulsars with radii ranging from a minimum of 10 km whereas a variation in anisotropy (fixed non-metricity) restricts the radii to a narrow window between ($12 - 13.2$) km for a 450 Hz pulsar. In addition, contributions from anisotropy outweigh the impact of nonmetricity in predicting the masses of pulsars with the ratio, $\left(\frac{M_\Delta}{M_Q}\right)_{max} \approx 2.43 $ for low mass pulsars.</description>

      <title>Unruh effect using Doppler shift method in DSR framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Unruh effect in doubly special relativity (DSR) framework by generalising the Doppler-shift method to DSR. For both the scalar and Dirac particles, we observe a deviation in the power spectrum of Unruh radiation from the standard Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions, respectively, due to the presence of the frame independent length scale of DSR. We further show that this deviation results in the modification of Unruh temperature which then depends non-linearly on the proper acceleration in DSR.</description>

      <title>A single-bubble source for gravitational waves in a cosmological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum fluctuations of an expanding phase transition bubble give rise to gravitational wave (GW) emission, even when considering a single bubble, without bubble collisions or plasma effects. The ratio of GW energy to the total bubble energy reservoir increases with time as $\propto t$. If the bubble expands for long enough before percolation destroys it, back-reaction due to the GW emission becomes important after $t_{\rm br}\sim (16\pi^5) m_{\rm pl}^2R_0^3$, where $R_0$ is the bubble nucleation radius and $m_{\rm pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass. As seen by experiments today, the GW energy spectrum would appear blue. However, simple estimates suggest that the signal falls short of detection by even ambitious future experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Cosmic shadows of causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic structure on the largest scales preserves the pattern laid down by quantum fluctuations of gravity in the early universe on scales comparable to inflationary horizons. It is proposed here that fluctuations create physical correlations only within finite regions enclosed by causal diamonds, like entanglement in other quantum systems. Conformal geometry is used to calculate a range of angular separation with no causal correlation. Correlations of the cosmic microwave background in this ``causal shadow'' are measured to be three to four orders of magnitude smaller than expected in standard inflation models. It is suggested that this measured symmetry of the primordial pattern signifies a new symmetry of quantum gravity associated with causal horizons.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of the de Sitter Spacetime with KR field based on the Lyapunov exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the spontaneously broken of the Lorentz symmetry in the gravity theory with the non-minimally coupling between the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field (that acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value) and the Einstein gravity, there exists the exactly static and spherically symmetric black holes solutions related with the Lorentz violating parameter. Based on this, we consider the corresponding black hole solution in the de-Sitter (dS) spacetime with the KR field and investigate the thermodynamic properties in the expanded phase space through introducing the interplay entropy between the black hole and cosmological horizons. Especially we analyze the effect of the Lorentz-violating parameter on the thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the Lyapunov exponent and the shadow of these static and spherically symmetric black holes in this Lorentz-violating gravity theory are also investigated. These study will open a new perspective to probe the thermodynamics of black holes.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>

      <title>Echoes from a long time ago: Chewbacca inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offers a unique avenue for exploring the early Universe's dynamics and evolution. In this paper, we delve into the fascinating realm of slow-roll inflation, contextualizing the primordial acoustic perturbations as the resonant echoes akin to the iconic sound of Chewbacca from the Star Wars universe. By extrapolating polynomial potentials for these primordial sounds, we illuminate their role in shaping the inflationary landscape. Leveraging this framework, we calculate the scalar spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), providing insights into the underlying physics governing the inflationary epoch. Employing a rigorous chi-square ($\chi^2$) analysis, we meticulously scrutinize the Planck data combined with that offered by the BICEP/Keck collaboration to identify the Chewbacca sound profile that best aligns with observational constraints. Our findings not only shed light on the intricate interplay between sound and cosmology but also unveil intriguing parallels between the cosmic symphony of the early universe and beloved cultural icons.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging and exiting result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals via multivoice decomposition in time and frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.02713v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) by "stitching" together a long inspiral waveform from a sequence of waveform snapshots, each of which corresponds to a particular geodesic orbit. We show that the complicated total waveform can be regarded as a sum of "voices." Each voice evolves in a simple way on long timescales, a property which can be exploited to efficiently produce waveform models that faithfully encode the properties of EMRI systems. We look at examples for a range of different orbital geometries: spherical orbits, equatorial eccentric orbits, and one example of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits. To our knowledge, this is the first calculation of a generic EMRI waveform that uses strong-field radiation reaction. We examine waveforms in both the time and frequency domains. Although EMRIs evolve slowly enough that the stationary phase approximation (SPA) to the Fourier transform is valid, the SPA calculation must be done to higher order for some voices, since their instantaneous frequency can change from chirping forward ($\dot f &gt; 0$) to chirping backward ($\dot f &lt; 0$). The approach we develop can eventually be extended to more complete EMRI waveform models, for example to include effects neglected by the adiabatic approximation such as the conservative self force and spin-curvature coupling.</description>

      <title>Dark-energy wormholes in generalized Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>

Abstract: This paper discusses traversable wormholes in a dark-energy setting by starting with a model due to Sung-Won Kim. This model, based on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model, is combined with a generalized Kaluza-Klein model. It is well known that phantom dark energy can in principle support traversable wormholes due to the violation of the null energy condition (NEC), a necessary condition for holding a wormhole open. Since the phantom divide constitutes a serious barrier, we retain the dark-energy assumption $a''(t)&gt;0$ but stay below the phantom divide. To show that the violation of the NEC can only come from the fifth dimension requires a careful analysis of the scale factor $a(t)$. While needed in the overall model, certain 1-forms lack this scale factor since the extra dimension, often assumed to be compactified, would not be affected by the cosmological expansion. The result is a viable wormhole model of the Sung-Won Kim type. Our main conclusion involves Morris-Thorne wormholes: due to the Kaluza-Klein gravity, we obtain a complete wormhole solution without crossing the phantom divide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider dark matter and dark energy as grand-canonical systems which are open, non-equilibrium coupled, and interacting systems. For the first time, we propose a new more realistic interaction scheme to explain dynamics between coupled interacting thermodynamic systems. Based on this new interaction schema, we propose new theorems to define the interactions including mutual and self-interactions. We proved the theorems based on the energy conservation law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we obtain new coupled equations using the theorems. We numerically solved the interaction equations and obtained phase space diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. We show that the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is chaotic. We conclude that these theorems and results can be generalized to all coupled interacting particle and thermodynamic systems. Finally, we evaluated that the obtained results indicate the existence of a new law in physics. Additionally, based on the results, we gave physical definitions of basic concepts such as chaos and self-organization and pointed out the existence of hidden symmetries and variables in interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the deflection angle of photon rays or light-like geodesics within the framework of Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity background space-time, taking into account the influence of cosmic strings. The primary focus lies in deriving the effective potential of the system applicable to both null and time-like geodesics, as well as determining the angle of deflection for light-like geodesics. Our analysis shows that the presence of cosmic strings induces modifications in these physical quantities, leading to shifts in their respective values.</description>

      <title>Observation constraints on scalar field cosmological model in Anisotropic universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we have explored a scalar field cosmological model in the axially symmetric Bianchi type-I universe. In this study, our aim is to constrain the scalar field dark energy model in an anisotropic background. For this purpose, the explicit solution of the developed field equations for the model is determined and analysed. Constraints on the cosmological model parameters are established utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and using the latest observational data sets of OHD, BAO, and Pantheon. For the combined dataset (OHD, BAO, and Pantheon), the best-fit values of Hubble and density parameters are estimated as $ H_{0} = 71.54\pm 0.28$, $\Omega_{m0}=0.2622\pm0.0021$ $\Omega_{\phi0} = 0.7331\pm0.0046$, and $\Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.000162\pm0.000063$. The model shows a flipping nature and redshift transition occurs at $z_{t} = 0.6964^{+0.0136}_{-0.0006}$, and the present value of decelerated parameter is computed to be $q_{0} = -0.6964\pm0.028$ for the combined dataset. We have explored characteristics like the universe's age, particle horizon, deceleration parameter, and jerk parameter. The dynamical properties such as energy density $\rho_{\phi}$, scalar field pressure $p_{\phi}$, and equation of state parameter $\omega_{\phi}$ are analyzed and presented. We have also described the behavior of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ and scalar fields. Furthermore, the authors also described the behavior of energy conditions in scalar-tensor cosmology. The scenario of the present accelerated expansion of the universe is described by the contribution of the scalar field.</description>

      <title>Sky location of Galactic white dwarf binaries in space-based gravitational wave detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quickly localizing the identified white dwarf (WD) binaries is the basic requirement for the space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection. In fact, the amplitude of GW signals are modulated by the periodic motion of GW detectors on the solar orbit. The intensity of the observed signals is enhanced according to the observation time beyond a year to enhance a high signal to noise ratio (SNR). As data gap exists, the completeness of the data observed for a long time depends on filling gaps in the data. Actually, in a year period, the GW sources have a best observation orbit position of GW detectors, where the detector response intensity of GW is maximum. Thus, the best positions, where the direction of GW source is perpendicular to the detection arms, can be searched for the verified GW sources of the sky map to enhance SNR too. For the three arms response intensity of the GW signals changing more clearly with the location of the GW sources relative to the detector, the noises and the suppression of noise by time delay interferometer are ignored. In the four chosen sources, the two verification WD binaries: J0806 and V407 Vul are observed at the best orbit positions by TAIJI for the short time of 2 and 3 days respectively. The intensities of those GWs are above the values of the TAIJI sensitivity curve, significantly. Compared with a single detector, the network of two detectors does not significantly improve the accuracy of location of the verification binaries. These results imply that the searching of GW signals and parameter estimation of GW sources from the experimental data of the space-based mission do not ignore the orbit positions relevant to GW sources.</description>

      <title>Unmasking noise transients masquerading as intermediate-mass black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first three observation runs, ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have observed close to 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events. The GW detection rates for CBCs are expected to increase with improvements in the sensitivity of the International Gravitational-Wave Observatory Network (IGWN). However, with improved sensitivity, non-Gaussian instrumental transients or ``glitches'' are expected to adversely affect GW searches and characterisation algorithms. The most detrimental effect is due to short-duration glitches, which mimic the morphology of short-duration GW transients, in particular Intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) binaries. They can be easily misidentified as astrophysical signals by current searches, and if included in astrophysical analyses, glitches mislabelled as IMBH binaries can affect IMBH population studies. In this work, we introduce a new similarity metric that quantifies the consistency of astrophysical parameters across the detector network and helps to distinguish between IMBH binaries and short-duration, loud glitches which mimic such binaries. We develop this method using a simulated set of IMBH binary signals and a collection of noise transients identified during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors.</description>

Abstract: The crease flow, replacing the Hamiltonian system used for the evolution of crease sets on black hole horizons, is introduced and its bifurcation properties for null hypersurfaces are discussed. We state the conditions of nondegeneracy and typicality for the crease submanifolds, and find their normal forms and versal unfoldings (codimension 3). The allowed boundary singularities are thus prescribed by the Arnold-Kazaryan-Shcherbak theorem for 3-parameter versal families, and hence identified as swallowtails and Whitney umbrellas of particular kinds. We further present the bifurcation diagrams describing crease evolution at the crossings of the bifurcation sets and elsewhere, and a typical example is studied. Some remarks on the connection of these results to the crease evolution on black hole horizons are also given.</description>

      <title>Twisting asymptotic symmetries and algebraically special vacuum solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic symmetries and algebraically special exact solutions in the Newman-Penrose formalism. Removing the hypersurface orthogonal condition in the well studied Newman-Unti gauge, we obtain a generic asymptotic solution space which includes all possible origins of propagating degree of freedom. The asymptotic symmetry of the generalized system extends the Weyl-BMS symmetry by two independent local Lorentz transformations with non-trivial boundary charges, which reveals new boundary degrees of freedom. The generalized Newman-Unti gauge includes algebraically special condition in its most convenient form. Remarkably, the generic solutions satisfying the algebraically special condition truncate in the inverse power of radial expansions and the non-radial Newman-Penrose equations are explicitly solved at any order. Hence, we provide the most general algebraically special solution space and the derivation is self-contained in the Newman-Penrose formalism. The asymptotic symmetry with respect to the algebraically special condition is the standard Weyl-BMS symmetry and the symmetry parameters consist only the integration constant order. We present the Kerr solution and Taub-NUT solution in the generalized Newman-Unti gauge in a simple form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first show that the master equations for massless perturbations of accelerating rotating black holes can be transformed into the Heun's equation. The quasinormal modes of the black holes can be easily calculated in the framework of the Heun's equation. We identify three modes for the tensor perturbations: the photon sphere modes, which reduce to the quasinormal modes of Kerr black holes when the acceleration parameter vanishes; the near-extremal modes, which branch from the first set and become dominant when the spin is near extremal; and the acceleration modes, which are closely related to the acceleration horizon. We calculate the frequency spectrum of the QNMs in various spin and acceleration parameters. We choose an angular boundary condition that keeps the angular function regular at $ \theta = 0 $ and $\pi$, which is consistent with the boundary condition of the Kerr black hole. The conical singularity caused by the acceleration influences this boundary condition. We find that the $m_0 = 1$ modes have an anomalous behavior at particular accelerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement islands play an essential role in the recent breakthrough in addressing the black hole information paradox. Inspired by double holography, it is conjectured that the entanglement islands can exist only in massive gravity. There are many pieces of evidence but also debates for this conjecture. This paper recovers the massless entanglement island in wedge holography with negative DGP gravity on the brane. However, the spectrum of negative DGP gravity includes a massive ghost, implying the model is unstable. Our work supports the view that there is no entanglement island in a well-defined braneworld model of massless gravity if one divides the radiation and black hole regions by minimizing entanglement entropy. However, such a partition results in a zero radiation region containing no information. Whether there are other physical non-trivial partitions of the radiation region is an open question and deserves further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new cosmological model (called $\tilde\Lambda$CDM) in which the vacuum energy interacts with matter and radiation, and test this model using the current cosmological observations. Using the CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) dataset to constrain the model, we find that $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to $2.87\sigma$ and $2.77\sigma$, respectively. However, in this case, the $\tilde\Lambda$CDM model is not favored by the data, compared with $\Lambda$CDM. We find that when the $H_0$ and $S_8$ data are added to the data combination, the situation is significantly improved. In the CBS+$H_0$ case, the model relieves the $H_0$ tension to $0.47\sigma$, and the model is favored over $\Lambda$CDM. In the CBS+$H_0$+$S_8$ case, we obtain a synthetically best situation, in which the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to $0.72\sigma$ and $2.11\sigma$, respectively. In this case, the model is most favored by the data. Therefore, this cosmological model can greatly relieve the $H_0$ tension and simultaneously effectively alleviate the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cousins: Identification of a Subpopulation of Binary Black Holes Consistent with Isolated Binary Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries have become a regular occurrence. The continued advancement of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration detectors have now produced a catalog of over 90 such mergers, from which we can begin to uncover the formation history of merging compact binaries. In this work, we search for subpopulations in the LVK's third gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) by incorporating discrete latent variables in the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to probabilistically assign each BBH observation into separate categories associated with distinctly different population distributions. By incorporating formation channel knowledge within the mass and spin correlations found in each category, we find an over density of mergers with a primary mass of $\sim10 M_\odot$, consistent with isolated binary formation. This low-mass subpopulation has a spin magnitude distribution peaking at $a_\mathrm{peak}=0.16^{0.19}_{-0.16}$, exhibits spins preferentially aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum, is constrained by $15^{+0.0}_{-1.0}$ of our observations, and contributes $82\%^{+8.0\%}_{-16\%}$ to the overall population of BBHs. Additionally, we find that the component of the mass distribution containing the previously identified $35M_\odot$ peak has spins consistent with the $10M_\odot$ events, with $99\%$ of primary masses less than $m_{1,99\%} = 49^{+25}_{-8.1} M_\odot$, providing an estimate of the lower edge of the theorized pair instability mass gap. This work is a first step in gaining a deeper understanding of compact binary formation and evolution, and will provide more robust conclusions as the catalog of observations becomes larger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to establish a refined version of the Page curve capable of describing an evaporating black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime. The Page curve traditionally exhibits a singular point, often interpreted as an indication of the Hawking-Page phase transition which occurs for an evaporating black hole in an asymptotically AdS spacetime. Conversely, an evaporating black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime is not expected to undergo such a transition. Therefore, we require a smoother, more consistent curve as a better-fitting model. In order to obtain the desired curve, we employ certain holographic assumptions and mathematical identities inherent to the curve's smoothness. Our results indicate that black hole radiation in an asymptotically flat spacetime possesses a notably higher informational content.</description>

      <title>Cone Holography with Neumann Boundary Conditions and Brane-localized Gauge Fields</title>

Abstract: Cone holography is a codimension-$n$ doubly holographic model, which can be interpreted as the holographic dual of edge modes on defects. The initial model of cone holography is based on mixed boundary conditions. This paper formulates cone holography with Neumann boundary conditions, where the brane-localized gauge fields play an essential role. Firstly, we illustrate the main ideas in an AdS$_4$/CFT$_1$ toy model. We show that the $U(1)$ gauge field on the end-of-the-world brane can make the typical solution consistent with Neumann boundary conditions. Then, we generalize the discussions to general codimension-$n$ cone holography by employing brane-localized $p$-form gauge fields. We also investigate perturbative solutions and prove the mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein gravitons is non-negative. Furthermore, we prove that cone holography obeys holographic $c$-theorem. Finally, inspired by the recently proposed chiral model in AdS/BCFT, we construct another type of cone holography with Neumann boundary conditions by applying massive vector (Proca) fields on the end-of-the-world brane.</description>

Abstract: The scalar fields, $U(1)$ gauge vector fields, and Kalb-Ramond fields are the $0$-form, 1-form, and 2-form fields, respectively. In four-dimensional space-time, free $q$-form fields are equivalent to scalar or vector fields by a duality, however, in higher-dimensional space-time, $q-$form fields correspond to new types of particles. In this paper, with considering a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term of the $q-$form fields and the background spacetime, we investigate the localization of Kaluza-Klein modes for the $q-$form fields on a $D-$dimensional Randall-Sundrum-like brane model. We demonstrate that the zero mode can be localized on the brane, and the massive Kaluza-Klein modes could be localized or quasi-localized on the brane when with certain value of parameters. Then, we present the localization of the scalar fields, $U(1)$ gauge vector fields, and 2-form Kalb-Ramond fields within a five-dimensional bulk spacetime. For a massless scalar field, an interesting characteristic emerges: When the parameter $t_2$ is negative, the zero mode is localized on both sides of the brane, whereas the massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be quasi-localized at the center of the brane.</description>
