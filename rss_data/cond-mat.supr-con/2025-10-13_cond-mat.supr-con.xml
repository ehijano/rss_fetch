      <title>Altermagnetism and Superconductivity: A Short Historical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the deep interconnections among three seemingly unrelated concepts in condensed matter physics: electronic liquid crystal phases, multipole expansions, and altermagnetism. At the heart of these phenomena lies a shared foundation: spin-momentum locking in the nonrelativistic regime. Originally proposed in the context of electronic liquid crystal phases, spin-momentum locking was later elegantly incorporated into the formalism of multipole expansions. This framework can be further extended across multiple atomic sites, making it particularly effective for describing altermagnets, which feature localized magnetic moments distributed over at least two sublattices. In the second part of the article, we examine superconducting phenomena that stem from this shared mechanism, focusing on superconductivity in systems with spin-momentum locked Fermi surfaces. We highlight a rich variety of unconventional superconducting states, including finite-momentum pairing, $d$-wave and spin-triplet superconductivity, and topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, among others. Additional related topics are addressed in the concluding section. Overall, this work offers both an accessible introduction to the newly identified magnetic order known as altermagnetism and a conceptual guide for researchers aiming to harness the ensuing unconventional superconductivity in the development of future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuation-induced first-order breaking of time-reversal symmetry in unconventional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors with competing non-degenerate pairing channels is an exotic quantum phase transition that could give rise to robust topological superconductivity and unusual magnetism. It is proposed mostly in two-dimensional systems and is signaled by a nonzero relative phase between the two superconducting order parameters, hence it should particularly be prone to order-parameter phase fluctuations. Nevertheless, the existing understanding of it is still at the mean-field level. Here, we illustrate the non-negligible effects of the phase fluctuations on such quantum phase transitions using the hole-doped square-lattice $t$-$J$ model as an example. We derive the phase fluctuation-corrected free energy and show that under the quantum phase fluctuations, the time-reversal asymmetric $s+id$ phase region splits off a dome featuring a first-order border with the $d$ phase, indicating the possibility of a phase separation into the time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric phases. The phase fluctuations also narrow the range of the $s+id$ phase considerably. We further discuss the implications of our findings for recent experiments on disorder-induced first-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity and promising high-temperature topological superconductivity in twisted cuprate Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases in a numerical model of a time-reversal-breaking superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we find an inhomogeneous stripes phase in a numerical model for an unconventional superconductor with time-reversal-breaking symmetry and triplet odd pairing. We contrast a robust well known homogeneous phase with dilute disorder characterized by a unitary resonance and a tiny gap that resembles an s-wave superconductor, with a new inhomogeneous phase with extremely dilute disorder and real frequency stripes. This phase has only two ultra-small frequency collision values at the edges of the unitary resonance, indicating the displacement of the s-wave tiny gap to the outer edges of the resonance. We perform a statistical analysis of the real frequency density and encounter a lack of spectral stability, characterized by a sequence of vertical frequency stripes. Experimentalists can verify this finding by looking for an unstable phase in extremely clean samples of candidates for triplet superconductors.</description>

      <title>Imaging of Gate-Controlled Suppression of Superconductivity via the Meissner Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that supercurrents flowing through thin superconducting nanowires can be quenched by a gate voltage. This gate control of supercurrents, known as the GCS effect, could enable superconducting transistor logic. Here, we report that the GCS also manifests in a suppression of Meissner screening, establishing the phenomenon as a genuine feature of superconductivity that is not restricted to transport. Using a scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer at sub-Kelvin temperatures, we image the nanoscale spatial region of GCS suppression in micron-size niobium islands. Our observations are compatible with a microscopic hot-spot model of quasiparticle generation and diffusion, and in conflict with other candidate mechanisms such as Joule heating or an electric field effect. Our work introduces an alternative means for studying quasiparticle dynamics in superconducting nanostructures, and showcases the power of local imaging techniques for understanding emergent condensed matter phenomena.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the repulsive Hubbard model on different geometries induced by density-assisted hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of density-assisted hopping on different dimerized lattice geometries, such as bilayers and ladder structures. We show analytically that the density-assisted hopping induces an attractive interaction in the lower (bonding) band of the dimer structure and a repulsion in the upper (anti-bonding) band. Overcoming the onsite repulsion, this can lead to the appearance of superconductivity. The superconductivity depends strongly on the filling, and present a pairing structure more complex than s-wave pairing. Combining numerical and analytical methods such as the matrix product states ansatz, bosonization and perturbative calculations we map out the phase diagram of the two-leg ladder system and identify its superconducting phase. We characterize the transition from the non-density-assisted repulsive regime to the spin-gapped superconducting regime as a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.</description>

      <title>Detecting Topological Phase Transition in Superconductor-Semiconductor Hybrids by Electronic Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the TPT by exploiting the static and dynamical density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses, the density response including the effect of Coulomb interactions, reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory is presented of a mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, based on the fact that 'nested' fermionic states near the Fermi surface of electrons/holes cause instability with respect to formation of the Q-balls (nontopological solitons) of coherently condensed spin/charge density wave fluctuations (SDW/CDW) with the wave-vector that matches the 'nesting' one. Simultaneously, the 'nested' fermions form superconducting condensate of Cooper/local pairs inside the Q-balls, with Q-ball SDW/CDW field being a 'pairing glue'. Thus, Q-balls possess lower total energy with respect to not condensed thermal SDW/CDW fluctuations and form a Q-balls 'gas' via first order phase transition below a temperature T$^*$. Besides, superconducting condensates inside the Q-balls induce a spectral gap on the nested parts of the Fermi surface, thus creating pseudogap phase. The Q-ball semiclassical field breaks chiral symmetry along the Matsubara time axis in Euclidean space-time possessing conserved Noether "charge" Q that makes the Q-ball volume finite. Prediction of the Q-ball scenario in cuprates is supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ in the pseudogap phase. The Q-balls of baryonic fields were originally predicted in Minkowski space-time by Sidney Coleman. In this paper it is demonstrated analytically that scattering of itinerant fermions on the Q-balls causes linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, that may explain famous 'Plankian' behavior in the 'strange metal' phase of high-Tc cuprates. Calculated diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas in the 'strange metal' phase and the phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates, with superconducting dome touching the 'strange metal' area at the optimal (holes)doping, are also in qualitative accord with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that vortices with circulating current, related with odd-frequency triplet pairing, appear in Josephson junctions where the barrier is a weak ferromagnet with strong spin-orbit coupling. By symmetry analysis we show that there is an additional term - a rotary invariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric effects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. Using a microscopic model based on a modified Usadel equation incorporating those effects, we show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the pairing amplitudes can form a texture.</description>

Abstract: We show that Hamiltonian for nonunitary mixed parity superconductivity can be recast into that for magnetism with spin-orbit coupling by the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, indicating that nonunitary mixed parity superconductivity and magnetism with spin-orbit coupling can share the same physics. As demonstrations, we discuss the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interactions, magnetoelectric effect, supercurrent-induced spin current, and altermagnetism in nonunitary mixed parity superconductors. All these effects originate purely from superconductivity, without any magnetism and spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the general circuit equations and system models directly from four Maxwell's equations and develop the electric-charge-based and magnetic-flux-based analysis methodologies to unify the analyses for both phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, and phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. We invent the electric-charge-flow (ECF) diagram and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagram to abstract electric circuits into electric-charge-pump (ECP) networks and magnetic-flux-pump (MFP) networks, and visualize the dynamics of charge and flux distributions in electric circuits. The ECF and MFF diagrams are the graphic expressions of the system models of electric circuits, which can be directly simulated through solving general circuit equations. They are novel graphic languages for electromagnetic field-based circuit design and analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for extracting a mass parameter using time-dependent density functional theory for an arbitrary physical system, provided the adiabatic limit is achievable. This approach works for collective variables also in the presence of a medium, in particular for the nuclei interacting with a neutron background. We apply the method to extract mass parameters of impurities in the neutron star crust, like their inertial masses and quadrupole mass parameters. The extracted mass parameters at various depths of the inner crust are compared with other methods, including the hydrodynamic approach. The presented method opens avenues for the construction of an effective model of neutron star crust grounded in microscopic calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</description>

Abstract: The functionalization of quantum devices to increase their performance and extend their fields of application is an extremely active research area. One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux controlled current phase relationship in double Quantum Dot Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian. By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and finally into a triplet state at $\phi = \pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases. Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\Gamma$ exceeds the SC pairing potential $\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when $\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge, resulting in a triple point in the ($\phi$, $\phi_B$) parameter space.</description>

We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</description>
