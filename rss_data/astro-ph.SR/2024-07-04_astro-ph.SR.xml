      <title>Large-scale ordered magnetic fields generated in mergers of helium white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar mergers are one important path to highly magnetised stars. Mergers of two low-mass white dwarfs may create up to every third hot subdwarf star. The merging process is usually assumed to dramatically amplify magnetic fields. However, so far only four highly magnetised hot subdwarf stars have been found, suggesting a fraction of less than $1\%$.
  We present two high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a binary system with the same total mass of $0.6\,M_\odot$. We analyse one equal-mass merger with two $0.3\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, and one unequal-mass merger with a $0.25\,M_\odot$ white dwarf and a $0.35\,M_\odot$ white dwarf. We simulate the inspiral, merger, and further evolution of the merger remnant for about $50$ rotations.
  We find efficient magnetic field amplification in both mergers via a small-scale dynamo, reproducing previous results of stellar merger simulations. The magnetic field saturates at similar strength for both simulations.
  We then identify a second phase of magnetic field amplification in both merger remnants that happens on a timescale of several tens of rotational periods of the merger remnant. This phase generates a large-scale ordered azimuthal field. We identify it as a large-scale dynamo driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI).
  Finally, we suggest that in the unequal-mass merger remnant, helium burning will eventually start in a shell around a cold core. The convection zone this generates will coincide with the region that contains most of the magnetic energy, probably erasing the strong, ordered field. The equal-mass merger remnant instead will probably ignite burning in the center, retaining its ordered field. Therefore, the mass ratio of the initial merger could be the selecting factor that decides if a merger remnant will stay highly magnetised long after the merger.</description>

      <title>The DBL Survey I: discovery of 34 double-lined double white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first discoveries of the double-lined double white dwarf (DBL) survey that targets over-luminous sources with respect to the canonical white dwarf cooling sequence according to a set of well-defined criteria. The primary goal of the DBL survey is to identify compact double white dwarf binary star systems from a unique spectral detection of both stars, which then enables a precise quantification of the atmospheric parameters and radial velocity variability of a system. Our search of 117 candidates that were randomly selected from a magnitude limited sample of 399 yielded a 29% detection efficiency with 34 systems exhibiting a double-lined signature. A further 51 systems show strong evidence of being single-lined or potentially-double-lined double white dwarf binaries and 6 single-lined sources from the full observed sample are radial velocity variable. The 32 remaining candidates appear as a single WD with no companion or a non-DA white dwarf, bringing the efficiency of detecting binaries to 73%. Atmospheric fitting of all double-lined systems reveals a large fraction that have two similar mass components that combine to a total mass of 1.0-1.3 solar masses - a class of double white dwarf binaries that may undergo a sub-Chandrasekhar mass type Ia detonation or merge to form a massive O/Ne WD, although orbital periods are required to infer on which timescales. One double-lined system located 49pc away, WDJ181058.67+311940.94, is super-Chandrasekhar mass, making it the second such double white dwarf binary to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Estimated Heating Rates Due to Cyclotron Damping of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via the cyclotron resonance, with such damping expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find such ion-scale waves are observed during $20.37\%$ of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity -- IV. Spectral analysis methods and exemplary results for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.</description>

      <title>On the response of massive main sequence stars to mass accretion and outflow at high rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a one-dimensional stellar evolution model, we find that massive main-sequence stars can accrete mass at very high mass accretion rates without expanding much if they lose a significant fraction of this mass from their outer layers simultaneously with mass accretion. We assume the accretion process is via an accretion disk that launches powerful jets from its inner zones. These jets remove the outer high-entropy layers of the mass-accreting star. This process operates in a negative feedback cycle, as the jets remove more envelope mass when the star expands. With the one-dimensional model, we mimic the mass removal by jets by alternative mass addition and mass removal phases. For the simulated models of 30Mo and 60Mo, the star does not expand much if we remove more than about half of the added mass in not-too-short episodes. This holds even if we deposit the energy the jets do not carry into the envelope. As the star does not expand much, its gravitational potential well stays deep, and the jets are energetic. These results are relevant to bright transient events of binary systems powered by accretion and the launching of jets, e.g., intermediate luminosity optical transients, including some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence of hybrid nature of EUV waves and the reflection of the fast-mode wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current study, we perform the analysis of an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave on 2022 March 31. The event originated from the from NOAA active region (AR) 12975 (location: N13W52) in the Atmospheric imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite and exactly the west limb in Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) observations. The EUV wave was associated with a GOES medium class i.e. M9.6 eruptive flare. The event was also well observed by MLSO and COR1 coronagraph. For the first time, we found here clear simultaneous observations of two components of EUV wave in AIA as well as in STEREO-A images, which was predicted in EUV wave hybrid model. These components are fast-mode wave and non-wave counterparts. The speed of fast-mode EUV wave in AIA 193 A is ~658$\pm$4 km/s, while the non-wave component propagates with a speed of ~157$\pm$3 km/s. The computed speed in STEREO-A 195 A for the fast-mode wave and non-wave components are ~590$\pm$3 km/s and ~150$\pm$2 km/s, respectively. The EUV wave interaction with AR shows the reflection of it above the solar limb. The speed of the reflected and transmitted wave components are 140 and 180 km/s, which is slower than the incident wave. With the precise alignments, we found the fast-mode EUV wave is just ahead of the coronal mass ejection (CME) and the non-wave component is cospatial with the core of the accompanied CME. In addition to these, the event also shows the stationary fronts and the reflection from the AR located towards the south of the EUV wave origin site.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Chemical Study of the Extreme Velocity Stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two decades on, the study of hypervelocity stars is still in its infancy. These stars can provide novel constraints on the total mass of the Galaxy and its Dark Matter distribution. However how these stars are accelerated to such high velocities is unclear. Various proposed production mechanisms for these stars can be distinguished using chemo-dynamic tagging. The advent of Gaia and other large surveys have provided hundreds of candidate hyper velocity objects to target for ground based high resolution follow-up observations. We conduct high resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations of 16 candidate late-type hyper velocity stars using the Apache Point Observatory and the McDonald Observatory. We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for these stars. We measure up to 22 elements, including the following nucleosynthetic families: {\alpha} (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light/Odd-Z (Na, Al, V, Cu, Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn), and Neutron Capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu). Our kinematic analysis shows one candidate is unbound, two are marginally bound, and the remainder are bound to the Galaxy. Finally, for the three unbound or marginally bound stars, we perform orbit integration to locate possible globular cluster or dwarf galaxy progenitors. We do not find any likely candidate systems for these stars and conclude that the unbound stars are likely from the the stellar halo, in agreement with the chemical results. The remaining bound stars are all chemically consistent with the stellar halo as well.</description>

      <title>Ultrasoft state of microquasar Cygnus X-3: X-ray polarimetry reveals the geometry of astronomical puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cygnus X-3 is an enigmatic X-ray binary, that is both an exceptional accreting system and a cornerstone for the population synthesis studies. Prominent X-ray and radio properties follow a well-defined pattern, yet the physical reasons for the state changes observed in this system are not known. Recently, the presence of an optically thick envelope around the central source in the hard state was revealed using the X-ray polarization data obtained with Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In this work, we analyse IXPE data obtained in the ultrasoft (radio quenched) state of the source. The average polarization degree (PD) of $11.9\pm0.5\%$ at a polarization angle (PA) of $94^{\circ}\pm1^{\circ}$ is inconsistent with the simple geometry of the accretion disc viewed at an intermediate inclination. The high PD, the blackbody-like spectrum, and the weakness of fluorescent iron line imply that the central source is hidden behind the optically thick outflow and its beamed radiation is scattered towards our line of sight. In this picture the observed PD is directly related to the source inclination, which we conservatively determine to lie in the range $26^{\circ}&lt;i&lt;28^{\circ}$. Using the new polarimetric properties, we propose the scenario that can be responsible for the cyclic behaviour of the state changes in the binary.</description>

      <title>$\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ elastic scattering in Borexino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of neutrino-electron elastic scattering using the mono-energetic $^{7}$Be neutrinos in Borexino, with an emphasis on exploring the differences between the contributions of $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, and $\nu_\tau$. We find that current data are capable of measuring these components such that the contributions from $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ cannot be zero, although distinguishing between them is challenging -- the differences stemming from Standard Model radiative corrections are insufficient without significantly more precise measurements. In studying these components, we compare predicted neutrino-electron scattering event rates within the Standard Model (accounting for neutrino oscillations), as well as going beyond the Standard Model in two ways. We allow for non-unitary evolution to modify neutrino oscillations, and find that with a larger exposure (${\sim}30$x), Borexino may provide relevant information for constraining non-unitarity, and that JUNO may be able to accomplish this with its data collection of $^{7}$Be neutrinos. We also consider novel $\nu_\mu$- and $\nu_\tau$-electron scattering from a gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ model, showing consistency with previous analyses of Borexino and this scenario, but also demonstrating the impact of uncertainties on Standard Model mixing parameters on these results.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- III. Multiple Populations along the low-mass Main Sequence stars of NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to its exceptional near-infrared photometry, JWST can effectively contribute to the discovery, characterization, and understanding of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, especially at low masses where the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) faces limitations. This paper continues the efforts of the JWST GO-1979 program in exploring the faintest members of the globular cluster NGC 6397. Here we show that the combination of HST and JWST data allows us to identify two groups of MS stars (MSa, the first-generation, and MSb, the second-generation group). We measured the ratio between the two groups and combined it with measurements from the literature focused on more central fields and more massive stars compared to our study. We find that the MSa and MSb stars are present in a $\approx$30-70 ratio regardless of the distance from the centre of the cluster and the mass of the stars used so far.</description>

      <title>The Symbiotic X-ray Binary IGR J16194-2810: A Window on the Future Evolution of Wide Neutron Star Binaries From Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical follow-up of IGR J16194-2810, a hard X-ray source discovered by the INTEGRAL mission. The optical counterpart is a $\sim500\,L_\odot$ red giant at a distance of $2.1$ kpc. We measured 17 radial velocities (RVs) of the giant over a period of $271$ days. Fitting these RVs with a Keplerian model, we find an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 192.73 \pm 0.01$ days and a companion mass function $f(M_2) = 0.365 \pm 0.003 \,M_{\odot}$. We detect ellipsoidal variability with the same period in optical light curves from the ASAS-SN survey. Joint fitting of the RVs, light curves, and the broadband SED allows us to robustly constrain the masses of both components. We find a giant mass of $M_\star = 0.99^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of $M_{2} = 1.23^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\,M_{\odot}$, implying that the companion is a neutron star (NS). We recover a $4.06$-hour period in the system's TESS light curve, which we tentatively associate with the NS spin period. The giant does not yet fill its Roche lobe, suggesting that current mass transfer is primarily via winds. MESA evolutionary models predict that the giant will overflow its Roche lobe in $5$-$10$ Myr, eventually forming a recycled pulsar + white dwarf binary with a $\sim 900$ day period. IGR J16194-2810 provides a window on the future evolution of wide NS + main sequence binaries recently discovered via Gaia astrometry. As with those systems, the binary's formation history is uncertain. Before the formation of the NS, it likely survived a common envelope episode with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $\gtrsim 10$ and emerged in a wide orbit. The NS likely formed with a weak kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 50\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$), as stronger kicks would have disrupted the orbit.</description>

      <title>A search for Galactic post-asymptotic giant branch stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. When low and intermediate-mass stars leave the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, and before they reach the Planetary Nebulae stage, they enter a very brief and rather puzzling stellar evolutionary stage named post-AGB.
  Aims. To provide a reliable catalogue of galactic post-AGB stars together with their physical and evolutionary properties obtained through Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry.
  Methods. We started by identifying post-AGB stars or possible candidates from the bibliography with their Gaia DR3 counterpart sources. Using the available photometry, interstellar extinction, literature spectroscopically derived temperatures or spectral types and parallax-derived distances from Gaia DR3, we fitted their Spectral Energy Distributions and we estimated their luminosities and circumstellar extinctions. When compared to models, luminosity values allowed us to disclose objects that are likely post-AGB stars from other target types. Their position on the HR diagram allows direct comparison with updated post-AGB evolutionary tracks and an estimation of their masses and evolutionary ages.
  Results. We obtained a sample of 69 reliable post-AGB candidates that meet our classification criteria, providing their coordinates, distances, effective temperature, total extinction, luminosity, mass, and evolutionary age. In addition, similar data for other stellar objects in our initial compilation, such as supergiant stars or young stellar objects, is provided.
  Conclusions. We have filtered out the data that have the best precision in parallaxes and distances to obtain more accurate luminosities, which allows us to classify with confidence the objects of the sample among different stellar phases. This allows us to provide a small but reliable sample of post-AGB objects. Derived mean evolutionary time and average mass values are in agreement with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Chromospheric Umbral Waves in Sunspots</title>

Abstract: Oscillations are ubiquitous in sunspots and the associated higher atmospheres. However, it is still unclear whether these oscillations are driven by the external acoustic waves (p-modes) or generated by the internal magnetoconvection. To obtain clues about the driving source of umbral waves in sunspots, we analyzed the spiral wave patterns (SWPs) in two sunspots registered by IRIS MgII 2796 {\AA} slit-jaw images. By tracking the motion of the SWPs, we find for the first time that two one-armed SWPs coexist in the umbra, and they can rotate either in the same or opposite directions. Furthermore, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the oscillation centers of the one-armed SWPs within the umbra (the oscillation center is defined as the location where the SWP first appears), we find that the chromospheric umbral waves repeatedly originate from the regions with high oscillation power and most of the umbral waves occur in the dark nuclei and strong magnetic field regions of the umbra. Our study results indicate that the chromospheric umbral waves are likely excited by the p-mode oscillations.</description>

      <title>Non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamic Instabilities in Protoplanetary Disks: Vertical Modes and Reflection Asymmetry</title>

Abstract: Magnetized disk winds and wind-driven accretion are an essential and intensively studied dispersion mechanism of protoplanetary disks. However, the stability of these mechanisms has yet to be adequately examined. This paper employs semi-analytic linear perturbation theories under non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, focusing on disk models whose magnetic diffusivities vary by a few orders of magnitude from the disk midplane to its surface. Linear modes are distinguished by their symmetry with respect to the midplane. These modes have qualitatively different growth rates: symmetric modes almost always decay, while at least one anti-symmetric mode always has a positive growth rate. This growth rate decreases faster than the Keplerian angular velocity with cylindrical radius $R$ in the disk and scales steeper than $R^{-5/2}$ in the fiducial disk model. The growth of anti-symmetric modes breaks the reflection symmetry across the disk equatorial plane, and may occur even in the absence of the Hall effect. In the disk regions where fully developed anti-symmetric modes occur, accretion flows appear only on one side of the disk, while disk winds occur only on the other. This may explain the asymmetry of some observed protoplanetary-disk outflows.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity dynamics of wide binaries -- II. The effect of stellar encounters and constraints on formation channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GAIA wide stellar binaries (separations $\sim 10^3-10^{4.5}$ AU) are observed to have a superthermal eccentricity distribution function (DF), well-fit by $P(e) \propto e^\alpha$ with $\alpha \sim 1.2$. In Modak \&amp; Hamilton (2023), we proved that this DF cannot have been produced by Galactic tidal torques starting from any realistic DF that was not already superthermal. Here, we consider the other major dynamical effect on wide binaries: encounters with passing stars. We derive and solve the Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of binaries in semimajor axis and eccentricity under many weak, impulsive, penetrative stellar encounters. We show analytically that these encounters drive the eccentricity DF towards thermal on the same timescale as they drive the semimajor axes $a$ towards disruption, $t_\mathrm{ion} \sim 4\,\mathrm{Gyr}\,(a/10^4\,\mathrm{AU})^{-1}$. We conclude that the observed superthermal DF must derive from an even more superthermal (i.e. higher $\alpha$) birth distribution. This requirement places strong constraints on the dominant binary formation channels. A testable prediction of our theory is that $\alpha$ should be a monotonically decreasing function of binary age.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an Expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Resolving the Local Group mass tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work compares the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$CDM background. Using the Timing Argument (which links LG dynamics to LG mass) we find that the full $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. By the calibration of the IllustrisTNG simulations, the TA mass is shown to be biased high, and modified to be $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the MW Center Of Mass (COM) reduce the LG mass to be $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The overall estimated mass is compatible with the total sum of masses of MW and M31 (including their halos) estimated independently. The mass also is compatible with other estimations such as the Hubble flow, the Virial Theorem with the other dwarf galaxies and different Machine Learning methods based on LG-like pairs from simulations. These results resolve the controversy between the TA based estimations and the other probes in the literature.</description>
