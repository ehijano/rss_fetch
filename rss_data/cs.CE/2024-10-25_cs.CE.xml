      <title>PRCpy: A Python Package for Processing of Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing (PRC) is a computing framework that harnesses the intrinsic dynamics of physical systems for computation. It offers a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional von Neumann computing for certain tasks, particularly those demanding both memory and nonlinearity. As PRC is implemented across a broad variety of physical systems, the need increases for standardised tools for data processing and model training. In this manuscript, we introduce PRCpy, an open-source Python library designed to simplify the implementation and assessment of PRC for researchers. The package provides a high-level interface for data handling, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Key concepts are described and accompanied by experimental data on two benchmark problems: nonlinear transformation and future forecasting of chaotic signals. Throughout this manuscript, which will be updated as a rolling release, we aim to facilitate researchers from diverse disciplines to prioritise evaluating the computational benefits of the physical properties of their systems by simplifying data processing, model training and evaluation.</description>

      <title>GPT-Signal: Generative AI for Semi-automated Feature Engineering in the Alpha Research Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the trading process, financial signals often imply the time to buy and sell assets to generate excess returns compared to a benchmark (e.g., an index). Alpha is the portion of an asset's return that is not explained by exposure to this benchmark, and the alpha research process is a popular technique aiming at developing strategies to generate alphas and gain excess returns. Feature Engineering, a significant pre-processing procedure in machine learning and data analysis that helps extract and create transformed features from raw data, plays an important role in algorithmic trading strategies and the alpha research process. With the recent development of Generative Artificial Intelligence(Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we present a novel way of leveraging GPT-4 to generate new return-predictive formulaic alphas, making alpha mining a semi-automated process, and saving time and energy for investors and traders.</description>

      <title>Resilience-based post disaster recovery optimization for infrastructure system via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure systems are critical in modern communities but are highly susceptible to various natural and man-made disasters. Efficient post-disaster recovery requires repair-scheduling approaches under the limitation of capped resources that need to be shared across the system. Existing approaches, including component ranking methods, greedy evolutionary algorithms, and data-driven machine learning models, face various limitations when tested within such a context. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel approach to optimize post-disaster recovery of infrastructure systems by leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods and incorporating a specialized resilience metric to lead the optimization. The system topology is represented adopting a graph-based structure, where the system's recovery process is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem. Deep Q-learning algorithms are employed to learn optimal recovery strategies by mapping system states to specific actions, as for instance which component ought to be repaired next, with the goal of maximizing long-term recovery from a resilience-oriented perspective. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we implement this scheme on the example of post-earthquake recovery optimization for an electrical substation system. We assess different deep Q-learning algorithms to this end, namely vanilla Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Double DQN(DDQN), Duel DQN, and duel DDQN, demonstrating superiority of the DDQN for the considered problem. A further comparative analysis against baseline methods during testing reveals the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of both optimization effect and computational cost, rendering this an attractive approach in the context of resilience enhancement and rapid response and recovery.</description>

      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly performing and helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems: Compositional fluid and electro-magneto hydrodynamics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing computational models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Considering the example of (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, the ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is reused as a subsystem of the electro-magneto hydrodynamics model. The compositional approach makes it nearly trivial to encapsulate, reuse, and swap out (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>
