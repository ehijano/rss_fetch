      <title>Multipacking in Euclidean Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of multipacking problems for geometric point sets with respect to their Euclidean distances. We consider a set of $n$ points $P$ and define $N_s[v]$ as the subset of $P$ that includes the $s$ nearest points of $v \in P$ and the point $v$ itself. We assume that the \emph{$s$-th neighbor} of each point is unique, for every $s \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots , n-1\}$. For a natural number $r \leq n$, an $r$-multipacking is a set $ M \subseteq P $ such that for each point $ v \in P $ and for every integer $ 1\leq s \leq r $, $|N_s[v]\cap M|\leq (s+1)/2$. The $r$-multipacking number of $ P $ is the maximum cardinality of an $r$-multipacking of $ P $ and is denoted by $ \MP_{r}(P) $. For $r=n-1$, an $r$-multipacking is called a multipacking and $r$-multipacking number is called as multipacking number. We study the problem of computing a maximum $r$-multipacking for point sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that a maximum $1$-multipacking can be computed in polynomial time but computing a maximum $2$-multipacking is NP complete. Further, we provide approximation and parameterized solutions to the $2$-multipacking problem.</description>

      <title>Sorted Consecutive Occurrence Queries in Substrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The string indexing problem is a fundamental computational problem with numerous applications, including information retrieval and bioinformatics. It aims to efficiently solve the pattern matching problem: given a text $T$ of length $n$ for preprocessing and a pattern $P$ of length $m$ as a query, the goal is to report all occurrences of $P$ as substrings of $T$. Navarro and Thankachan [CPM 2015, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2016] introduced a variant of this problem called the gap-bounded consecutive occurrence query, which reports pairs of consecutive occurrences of $P$ in $T$ such that their gaps (i.e., the distances between them) lie within a query-specified range $[g_1, g_2]$. Recently, Bille et al. [FSTTCS 2020, Theor. Comput. Sci. 2022] proposed the top-$k$ close consecutive occurrence query, which reports the $k$ closest consecutive occurrences of $P$ in $T$, sorted in non-descending order of distance. Both problems are optimally solved in query time with $O(n \log n)$-space data structures.
  In this paper, we generalize these problems to the range query model, which focuses only on occurrences of $P$ in a specified substring $T[a.. b]$ of $T$. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose an $O(n \log^2 n)$-space data structure that answers the range top-$k$ consecutive occurrence query in $O(|P| + \log\log n + k)$ time. (2) We propose an $O(n \log^{2+\epsilon} n)$-space data structure that answers the range gap-bounded consecutive occurrence query in $O(|P| + \log\log n + \mathit{output})$ time, where $\epsilon$ is a positive constant and $\mathit{output}$ denotes the number of outputs. Additionally, as by-products, we present algorithms for geometric problems involving weighted horizontal segments in a 2D plane, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that among $n$ points in the plane in general position, the shortest distance occurs at most $43n/18$ times, improving upon the upper bound of $17n/7$ obtained by T\'oth in 1997.</description>
