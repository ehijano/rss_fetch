      <title>Darboux formulae for linear hyperbolic equations in discrete case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the second half of the 19th century Darboux obtained determinant formulae that provide the general solution for a linear hyperbolic second order PDE with finite Laplace series. These formulae played an important role in his study of the theory of surfaces and, in particular, in the theory of conjugate nets. During the last three decades discrete analogs of conjugate nets (Q-nets) were actively studied. Laplace series can be defined also for hyperbolic difference operators. We prove discrete analogs of Darboux formulae for discrete and semi-discrete hyperbolic operators with finite Laplace series.</description>

      <title>A direct method in noncommutative integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a constructive framework for deriving noncommutative (NC) integrable equations directly from quasi-determinant solutions. Building upon the quasi-Wronskian structure, we extend the classical direct method to the NC setting, where standard determinant identities are replaced by algebraic relations intrinsic to quasi-determinants. By analyzing derivative identities satisfied by quasi-determinants, we recover the NC Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (ncKP) and Date-Jimbo-Kashiwara-Miwa (ncDJKM) equations by cancellations of nonlinear terms. Furthermore, by imposing flow constraints on the seed functions, we derive NC reductions such as the ncKdV and ncBoussinesq equations and obtain explicit matrix-valued soliton solutions. Our results highlight the quasi-determinant as a fundamental algebraic structure underpinning NC $\tau$-function structure.</description>

      <title>Thermal phase slips in superconducting films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dissipationless supercurrent state in superconductors can be destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Thermally activated phase slips provide a finite resistance of the sample and are responsible for dark counts in superconducting single photon detectors. The activation barrier for a phase slip is determined by a space-dependent saddle-point (instanton) configuration of the order parameter. In the one-dimensional wire geometry, such a saddle point has been analytically obtained by Langer and Ambegaokar in the vicinity of the critical temperature, $T_c$, and for arbitrary bias currents below the critical current $I_c$. In the two-dimensional geometry of a superconducting strip, which is relevant for photon detection, the situation is much more complicated. Depending on the ratio $I/I_c$, several types of saddle-point configurations have been proposed, with their energies being obtained numerically. We demonstrate that the saddle-point configuration for an infinite superconducting film at $I\to I_c$ is described by the exactly integrable Boussinesq equation solved by Hirota's method. The instanton size is $L_x\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/4}$ along the current and $L_y\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/2}$ perpendicular to the current, where $\xi$ is the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length. The activation energy for thermal phase slips scales as $\Delta F^\text{2D}\propto (1-I/I_c)^{3/4}$. For sufficiently wide strips of width $w\gg L_y$, a half-instanton is formed near the boundary, with the activation energy being 1/2 of $\Delta F^\text{2D}$.</description>

      <title>Integrable Kuralay equations: geometry, solutions and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Kuralay equations, namely, the Kuralay-I equation (K-IE) and the Kuralay-II equation (K-IIE). The integrable motion of space curves induced by these equations is investigated. The gauge equivalence between these two equations is established. With the help of the Hirota bilinear method, the simplest soliton solutions are also presented. The nonlocal and dispersionless versions of the K-IE and K-IIE are considered.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\beta_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x;\tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 +\tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R},$$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. It is known that the recurrence coefficients $\beta_n$ satisfy a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation, which is a special case of the second member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy, often known as the ''string equation''. The recurrence coefficients have been studied in the context of Hermitian one-matrix models and random symmetric matrix ensembles with researchers in the 1990s observing ''chaotic, pseudo-oscillatory'' behaviour. More recently, this ''chaotic phase'' was described as a dispersive shockwave in a hydrodynamic chain. Our emphasis is a comprehensive study of the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as the parameters $\tau$ and $t$ vary. Extensive computational analysis is carried out, using Maple, for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions and modified Bessel functions. The results highlight the rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <title>KP integrability of non-perturbative differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the KP integrability of non-perturbative topological recursion, which can be considered as a formal $\hbar$-deformation of the Krichever construction of algebro-geometric solutions of the KP hierarchy. This property goes back to a 2011 conjecture of Borot and Eynard.</description>
