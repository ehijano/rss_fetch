      <title>RationalFunctionApproximation.jl: Rational Approximation On Discrete and Continuous Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike polynomials, rational functions can represent functions having poles or branch cuts with root-exponential convergence and no Runge phenomenon. Recent developments of the AAA and greedy Thiele algorithms have sparked renewed interest in computational rational approximation. The \textsf{RationalFunctionApproximation} package supplies the fastest known implementations of these methods and the only arbitrary-precision ones. Combined with the \textsf{ComplexRegions} package, it can produce compact and accurate representations of a huge variety of functions over intervals, circles, or other domains in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>A polynomial dimension-dependence analysis of Bramble--Pasciak--Xu preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dimension dependence of Bramble--Pasciak--Xu (BPX) preconditioners for high-dimensional partial differential equations and establish that the condition numbers of BPX-preconditioned systems grow only polynomially with the spatial dimension. Our analysis requires a careful derivation of the dimension dependence of several fundamental tools in the theory of finite element methods, including the elliptic regularity, Bramble--Hilbert lemma, trace inequalities, and inverse inequalities. We further introduce a new quasi-interpolation operator into finite element spaces, a variant of the classical Scott--Zhang interpolation, whose associated constants scale polynomially with the dimension. Building on these ingredients, we prove a multilevel norm equivalence theorem and derive a BPX preconditioner with explicit polynomial bounds on its dimensional dependence. This result has notable implications for emerging quantum computing methodologies: recent studies indicate that polynomial dependence of BPX preconditioners on dimension can yield exponential speedups for quantum-algorithmic approaches over their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Formula-based Nonlinear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quadratic formula-based nonlinear representation for a given single-variable function f(x), $-1 \leq x \leq 1$. First, we construct the explicit polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) using a least-squares approach. Then, f is reconstructed by solving the degree-2 polynomial equation a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0 for any $x \in [-1,1]$, where an index function is used to select the correct sign in the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula-based nonlinear approximation (degree-2 in f) outperforms classical orthogonal polynomial-based least-squares approximation (degree-0 in f) and rational approximation (degree-1 in f) for functions with sharp transitions or discontinuities. As a potential application, we apply the degree-2 representation to data denoising. Instead of relying on more complex "edge-preserving" metric-based optimization techniques, the smooth coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) enable effective least-squares-based denoising on the low-dimensional manifold described by the algebraic variety a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0. Denoising the index function, which determines the appropriate root to select, can be achieved using classical statistical or modern classification/clustering techniques. Numerical results and data denoising examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the degree-2 nonlinear approximation technique. The new nonlinear, quadratic formula-based representation also raises theoretical and numerical questions, including strategies for identifying numerically stable representations, developing optimal algorithms to construct the polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x), and achieving economical representation and denoising of the index function.</description>

      <title>A two-stage explicit/implicit approach combined with mixed finite element methods for a radiation-conduction model in optically thick anisotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a two-stage explicit/impicit computational technique combined with a mixed finite element method for solving a nonlinear radiation-conduction problem in anisotropic media, subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. The space derivatives are approximated by the mixed finite element method ($\mathcal{P}_{p}/\mathcal{P}_{p-1}/\mathcal{P}_{p-1}$), while the interpolation technique is employed in two stages to approximate the time derivative. The proposed strategy is so-called, a two-stage explicit/implicit computational technique combined with mixed finite element method. Specifically, the new algorithm should be observed as a predictor-corrector numerical scheme. Additionally, it efficiently treats the time derivative term and provides a necessary requirement on time step for stability. Under this time step limitation, the stability is deeply analyzed whereas the convergence order is numerically obtained in the $L^{2}$-norm. The theoretical results suggest that the developed approach is spatial fourth-order convergent and temporal second-order accurate. Some numerical experiments are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and to demonstrate the practical applicability of the new algorithm.</description>

      <title>B-spline periodization of Fourier pseudo-spectral method for non-periodic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral methods are renowned for their high accuracy and efficiency in solving partial differential equations. The Fourier pseudo-spectral method is limited to periodic domains and suffers from Gibbs oscillations in non-periodic problems. The Chebyshev method mitigates this issue but requires edge-clustered grids, which does not match the characteristics of many physical problems. To overcome these restrictions, we propose a B-spline-periodized Fourier (BSPF) method that extends to non-periodic problems while retaining spectral-like accuracy and efficiency. The method combines a B-spline approximation with a Fourier-based residual correction. The B-spline component enforces the smooth matching of boundary values and derivatives, while the periodic residual is efficiently treated by Fourier differentiation/integration. This construction preserves spectral convergence within the domain and algebraic convergence at the boundaries. Numerical tests on differentiation and integration confirm the accuracy of the BSPF method superior to Chebyshev and finite-difference schemes for interior-oscillatory data. Analytical mapping further extends BSPF to non-uniform meshes, which enables selective grid refinement in regions of sharp variation. Applications of the BSPF method to the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional shallow water equations demonstrate accurate resolution of sharp gradients and nonlinear wave propagation, proving it as a flexible and efficient framework for solving non-periodic PDEs with high-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>FEALPy v3: A Cross-platform Intelligent Numerical Simulation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In resent years, the software ecosystem for numerical simulation still remains fragmented, with different algorithms and discretization methods often implemented in isolation, each with distinct data structures and programming conventions. This fragmentation is compounded by the growing divide between packages from different research fields and the lack of a unified, universal data structure, hindering the development of integrated, cross-platform solutions. In this work, we introduce FEALPy, a numerical simulation engine built around a unified tensor abstraction layer in a modular design. It enables seamless integration between diverse numerical methods along with deep learning workflows. By supporting multiple computational backends such as NumPy, PyTorch, and JAX, FEALPy ensures consistent adaptability across CPU and GPU hardware systems. Its modular architecture facilitates the entire simulation pipeline, from mesh handling and assembly to solver execution, with built-in support for automatic differentiation. In this paper, the versatility and efficacy of the framework are demonstrated through applications spanning linear elasticity, high-order PDEs, moving mesh methods, inverse problems and path planning.</description>

      <title>Coarse spaces for virtual element methods on irregular 3D subdomain decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner for three-dimensional problems discretized with the Virtual Element Method. Our approach handles general polyhedral meshes and irregular subdomains, extending the applicability of previous methods. Numerical experiments show robust performance with respect to the number of subdomains and mesh parameters, with condition-number bound comparable to classical finite element results. While alternative methods such as FETI-DP and BDDC are available, the simplicity and competitiveness of overlapping additive Schwarz methods underscore the practical significance of our contribution.</description>

      <title>Escaping the native space of Sobolev kernels by interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical convergence analysis for kernel interpolation typically assumes that the target function $f$ lies in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_k\!\left(\Omega\right)$ induced by a kernel on a domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$. For many applications, however, this assumption is overly restrictive. We develop a general framework for analyzing the convergence of kernel interpolation {beyond the native space}. Let $A(\Omega)$ and $B(\Omega)$ be Banach spaces with continuous embeddings $\mathcal{H}_k\!\left(\Omega\right) \hookrightarrow A(\Omega)\hookrightarrow B(\Omega)$, assume point evaluation is continuous on $A(\Omega)$, and that $\mathcal{H}_k\!\left(\Omega\right)$ is dense in $A(\Omega)$. For a nested sequence of node sets $(X_n)_{n\ge1}\subset\Omega$ with $\bigcup_n X_n$ dense, we characterize convergence of the kernel interpolants in the $B(\Omega)$-norm for all target functions in $A(\Omega)$ via the uniform boundedness of the interpolation operators $\Pi^{\,n}_{A,B}:A(\Omega)\to B(\Omega)$. This yields a necessary and sufficient condition under which kernel interpolation extends beyond $\mathcal{H}_k\!\left(\Omega\right)$. Specializing to Sobolev kernels of order $\tau&gt;N/2$ on bounded Lipschitz domains, we show that every $f \in C(\overline{\Omega})$ can be approximated in the $L^2(\Omega)$-norm by interpolation using quasi-uniform nested centers. Moreover, for a subclass of Sobolev kernels (including integer-order Mat\'ern kernels), we prove that the Lebesgue constant is uniformly bounded on $[a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}$ under quasi-uniform centers; within our framework this implies supremum norm convergence of the interpolants for every target functions $f \in C([a,b])$.</description>

      <title>On the Orbits of Similarity Classes of Tetrahedra Generated by the Longest-Edge Bisection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of similarity classes of tetrahedra generated by the longest-edge bisection (LEB) algorithm. Building on the normalization strategy introduced by Perdomo and Plaza for triangles, we construct a canonical representation of tetrahedra in a normalized space embedded in the product of the hyperbolic half-plane and the hyperbolic half-space model. This representation allows us to define the left and right refinement maps, $\Phi_L$ and $\Phi_R$, acting on the space of normalized tetrahedral shapes, and to study their iterative orbits as discrete dynamical systems. Using these maps, we show that the orbit of the space-filling Sommerville tetrahedron contains only 4 similarity classes, 3 of which form an attractive cycle corresponding to the orbit of the path tetrahedron. We also show that small perturbations of elements in those orbits still lead to finite orbits. In addition, we study small perturbations of the regular tetrahedron and show that their orbits are also finite. Extensive numerical exploration of orbits for the other types of tetrahedra suggests that the LEB algorithm does not produce degenerating tetrahedra. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for analyzing the shape evolution of tetrahedral meshes and offers a possible route toward an analytic proof of the non-degeneracy property for the tetrahedral partitions generated by the LEB refinements. This property is highly desired in e.g. the finite element methods (FEMs).</description>

      <title>On semi-separability and differentiation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of spectral methods for partial differential equations leads to infinite-dimensional matrices which represent the derivative operator with respect to an underlying orthonormal basis. Favourable properties of such differentiation matrices are crucial in the design of good spectral methods. It is known that bases using Laguerre and ultraspherical polynomials lead to semi-separable differentiation matrices of rank 1. In this paper we consider orthonormal bases constructed from Jacobi polynomials and prove that the underlying differentiation matrices are semi-separable of rank 2. This requires new results on semi-separable matrices which might be interesting in a wider context.</description>

      <title>Non-Intrusive Data-Free Parametric Reduced Order Model for Geometrically Nonlinear Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully non-intrusive parametric reduced-order modeling (PROM) framework for geometrically nonlinear structures subject to geometric variations. The method builds upon equation-driven Galerkin ROMs constructed from vibration modes and modal-derivative companion vectors, while nonlinear reduced tensors are identified from standard finite element outputs. A database of such ROMs is generated over a set of training samples, and all reduced operators-including the linear stiffness matrix, the quadratic and cubic nonlinear tensors, the Rayleigh damping parameters, and the reduction basis-are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). A global reduced basis is obtained through a two-level POD compression, combined with a MAC-guided reordering strategy to ensure parametric smoothness. The resulting PROM preserves the symmetry and polynomial structure of the reduced equations, enabling robust and efficient adaptation to new parameter values. Analytical parameter sensitivities follow directly from the interpolation model. The approach is demonstrated on a parametrically curved panel and a wing-box with geometric variations, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations and enabling substantial reductions in computational cost for parametric analyses.</description>

      <title>Structure preserving discretization method for 1D and 2D port-Hamiltonian systems using finite differences on staggered grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends previous work on finitedifference schemes over staggered grids for infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems. In the one-dimensional setting, it generalizes the discretization approach originally developed for the wave equation to a broader class of systems characterized by interconnection operators that include both differential and non-differential terms, such as the Timoshenko beam equation. The paper then introduces a discretization strategy for the two-dimensional case that requires only two grids, thereby accommodating a wider range of systems, including those whose interconnection operators contain non-differential components, such as the Mindlin plate model.</description>

      <title>A linear MARS method for three-dimensional interface tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For explicit interface tracking in three dimensions, we propose a linear MARS method that (a) represents the interface by a partially ordered set of glued surfaces and approximates each glued surface with a triangular mesh, (b) maintains an $(r,h,\theta)$-regularity on each triangular mesh so that the distance between any pair of adjacent markers is within the range $[rh,h]$ and no angle in any triangle is less than $\theta$, (c) applies to three-dimensional continua with arbitrarily complex topology and geometry, (d) preserves topological structures and geometric features of moving phases under diffeomorphic and isometric flow maps, and (e) achieves second-order and third-order accuracy in terms of the Lagrangian and Eulerian length scales, respectively. Results of classic benchmark tests verify the effectiveness of the novel mesh adjustment algorithms in enforcing the $(r,h,\theta)$-regularity and demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed linear MARS method.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Boltzmann equation with random uncertainties arising from the initial data and collision kernel in the {\it whole space}, along with their stochastic Galerkin (SG) approximations. By employing Green's function method, we show that, the higher-order derivatives of the solution with respect to the random variable exhibit polynomial decay over time. These results are then applied to analyze the SG method for the SG system and to demonstrate the polynomial decay of the numerical error over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new abstraction for the representation and solution of multi-domain problems using finite element methods. This is an advance over previous work in that it achieves a single higher-level abstraction that represents multi-domain problems in the mixed variational problem formalism. We implemented our new abstraction in UFL and Firedrake, and validated our implementations solving a quad-triangle mixed-cell-type problem, a hex-quad mixed-cell-type problem, and a fluid-structure interaction benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Bending in Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Characteristic Bending (CB) method, a general framework for advecting quantities under incompressible velocity fields. The method builds on standard semi-Lagrangian advection by interpreting the backward-in-time characteristic reconstruction as the construction of a reference map, a diffeomorphism between the current and initial geometries of the advected space. From this viewpoint, the CB method applies a volume-preserving projection to the map, systematically removing spurious compressible errors arising from time integration, interpolation, or from velocity fields that are only approximately divergence-free. This projection bends the characteristics toward the divergence-free space, preserving mass and geometric features of the advected fields, even in the presence of significant error. We demonstrate the method in both two and three dimensions using benchmark problems and for multiphase flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The results show that the CB method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional semi-Lagrangian schemes and as an augmentation of reference map formulations, offering improved robustness and accuracy in incompressible flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Preconditioning is a Geodesically Convex Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for computing approximately-optimal preconditioners for solving linear and non-linear systems of equations. We demonstrate that the condition number minimization problem, under structured transformations such as diagonal and block-diagonal preconditioners, is geodesically convex with respect to unitarily invariant norms, including the Frobenius and Bombieri--Weyl norms. This allows us to introduce efficient first-order algorithms with precise convergence guarantees. 
For linear systems, we analyze the action of symmetric Lie subgroups $G \subseteq \GL_m(\CC) \times \GL_n(\CC)$ on the input matrix and prove that the logarithm of the condition number is a smooth geodesically convex function on the associated Riemannian quotient manifold. We obtain explicit gradient formulas, show Lipschitz continuity, and prove convergence rates for computing the optimal Frobenius condition number: $\widetilde{O}(1/\eps^2)$ iterations for general two-sided preconditioners and $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_F^2 \log(1/\eps))$ for strongly convex cases such as left preconditioning. We extend our framework to consider preconditioning of polynomial systems $\f(x) = 0$, where $\f$ is a system of multivariate polynomials. We analyze the local condition number $\mu(\f, \xi)$, at a root $\xi$ and prove that it also admits a geodesically convex formulation under appropriate group actions. We deduce explicit formulas for the Riemannian gradients and present convergence bounds for the corresponding optimization algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first preconditioning algorithm with theoretical guarantees for polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>Half-explicit Runge-Kutta integrators for variational multiscale turbulence modeling: Toward higher-order accuracy in space and time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The residual-based variational multiscale (VMS) formulation has achieved remarkable success in large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows. However, its temporal discretization has largely remained limited to second-order implicit schemes. The present work aims at advancing this direction through the introduction of Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes within the VMS framework in a mathematically consistent manner. Guided by the Rothe method, the half-explicit RK scheme is employed as its accuracy is theoretically guaranteed for index-2 differential-algebraic equations. Owing to the explicit treatment of the nonlinear term, the resulting spatial problem exhibits a structure analogous to that of the Darcy equation. Following the philosophy of the VMS analysis, a subgrid-scale model is derived without invoking linearization based on perturbation series and related assumptions. The analysis further reveals that the parameter in the subgrid model is independent of the spatial mesh size. Fourier analysis demonstrates that the Rothe method, compared with the conventional vertical method of lines, provides improved dissipation and dispersion properties and exhibits a larger stability region for convection-dominated regimes. In the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, the proposed schemes demonstrate superior performance as a large-eddy simulation model, achieving higher fidelity in predicting the kinetic energy evolution, energy spectra, and vortex structures than the conventional VMS formulation. Simulations of the open cavity flow further show that the proposed schemes can accurately capture the periodic limit cycle caused by the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, confirming its effectiveness and fidelity for highly sensitive flow instability problems.</description>

Abstract: Subject-specific cardiovascular models rely on parameter estimation using measurements such as 4D Flow MRI data. However, acquiring high-resolution, high-fidelity functional flow data is costly and taxing for the patient. As a result, there is growing interest in using highly undersampled MRI data to reduce acquisition time and thus the cost, while maximizing the information gain from the data. Examples of such recent work include inverse problems to estimate boundary conditions of aortic blood flow from highly undersampled k-space data. The undersampled data is selected based on a predefined sampling mask which can significantly influences the performance and the quality of the solution of the inverse problem. While there are many established sampling patterns to collect undersampled data, it remains unclear how to select the best sampling pattern for a given set of inference parameters. In this paper we propose an Optimal Experimental Design (OED) framework for MRI measurements in k-space, aiming to find optimal masks for estimating specific parameters directly from k-space. As OED is typically applied to sensor placement problems in spatial locations, this is, to our knowledge, the first time the technique is used in this context. We demonstrate that the masks optimized by employing OED consistently outperform conventional sampling patterns in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and variance, facilitating a speed-up of 10x of the acquisition time while maintaining accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in for both training of neural networks and inference. To accelerate matrix multiplication, Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) provide it implemented in hardware. Due to the increased throughput over the software-based matrix multiplication, the multipliers are increasingly used outside of AI, to accelerate various applications in scientific computing. However, matrix multipliers targeted at AI are at present not compliant with IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic behaviour, with different vendors offering different numerical features. This leads to non-reproducible results across different generations of GPU architectures, at the matrix multiply-accumulate instruction level. To study numerical characteristics of matrix multipliers-such as rounding behaviour, accumulator width, normalization points, extra carry bits, and others-test vectors are typically constructed. Yet, these vectors may or may not distinguish between different hardware models, and due to limited hardware availability, their reliability across many different platforms remains largely untested. We present software models for emulating the inner product behavior of low- and mixed-precision matrix multipliers in the V100, A100, H100 and B200 data center GPUs in most supported input formats of interest to mixed-precision algorithm developers: 8-, 16-, and 19-bit floating point.</description>

Abstract: Among all of the non-Hermitian large-tridiagonal-matrix quantum Hamiltonians we choose a subclass with the structure resembling the ``benchmark'' realistic Bose-Hubbard model. We demonstrate that this choice can be declared user-friendly in the sense that the underlying singular values can be specified via a ``Hermitized'' Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation. In particular, the related ``Hermitized'' Green's functions is shown given the two alternative compact and numerically efficient matrix continued fraction forms.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the optimal control value function in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces from verification conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating the optimal value function $v^*$ for infinite-horizon, nonlinear, autonomous optimal control problems is both challenging and essential for synthesizing real-time optimal feedback. We develop an abstract optimal recovery framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) for reconstructing unknown target functions from mixed equality and inequality functional constraints. Within this framework, the approximation of $v^*$ is cast as a collocation-type problem derived from verification conditions for optimality -- most prominently, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation -- that uniquely characterizes $v^*$. As the set of collocation points becomes dense in the ambient domain $\Omega$, we establish convergence of the RKHS approximants to $v^*$: globally on $\Omega$ in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is analytic, and locally (in a neighborhood of the origin) in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is bounded from above and below by quadratic functions. Furthermore, we show that a practical numerical realization of the abstract scheme reduces to the classical policy iteration algorithm. Numerical experiments support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Closed-form Solution to the Wahba Problem for Pairwise Similar Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form solution to Wahba's problem in the quaternion domain for the special case of two vector observations. Existing approaches, including Davenport's $q$-method, QUEST, Horn's method, and ESOQ algorithms, recover the optimal quaternion through the eigendecomposition of a $4\times4$ matrix or iterative numerical methods. Consequently, these methods do not reveal the analytic structure of the optimal quaternion.
  In this work, we derive an explicit analytical characterization of all quaternions that yield zero Wahba cost for the case $\ell=2$. Our approach builds on a connection between quaternion similarity, the singular Sylvester equation $aq=qb$, and quaternion square roots established in our previous work [1]. We provide (i) necessary and sufficient conditions under which the Wahba's cost function is zero and (ii) a closed-form parameterization of all such quaternions. This eliminates the need for eigenvalue computations and enables a direct algebraic understanding of the underlying geometry of Wahba's problem.</description>

Abstract: We propose novel scale-invariant error estimators for the Monte Carlo and multilevel Monte Carlo estimation of mean and variance. For any linear transformation of the distribution of the quantity of interest, the computation cost across fidelity levels is optimized using a normalized error estimate, which is not only fully dimensionless but also remains robust to variation in characteristics of the distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms through application to a mechanical simulation of linear elastic bone tissue, where material uncertainty incorporating both heterogeneity and random anisotropy is considered in the constitutive law.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses the imposition of outflow boundary conditions for one-dimensional conservation laws. While a highly accurate numerical solution can be obtained in the interior of the domain, boundary discretization can lead to unphysical reflections. We investigate and implement some classes of relaxation methods and far-field operators to deal with this problem without significantly increasing the size of the computational domain. We formulate these methods within a framework that allows to reveal relationships among them, and to propose novel extensions. In particular, we introduce a simple and robust relaxation method with a matrix-valued weight function that selectively absorbs outgoing waves. As a challenging model problem, we consider the Lagrangian formulation of the Euler equations for a polytropic gas with inflow boundary conditions determined by an oscillating piston.</description>

      <title>Splitting methods based on the nonzero diagonal pattern for computing matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of approximating a matrix function $f(A)$, where $A$ is a matrix in which only a relatively small number of (not necessarily consecutive) sub- and superdiagonals contain nonzero entries. Approximating $f$ by a low-degree polynomial $p$ allows us to obtain sparse approximations to $f(A)$, which one can efficiently work with (while, in general, $f(A)$ is a dense matrix, even when $A$ is sparse). Our approach is based on carefully inspecting the locations where nonzeros can occur in $p(A)$, and identifying the entries in $A$ that influence them. In particular, we illustrate how this approach can be used for efficiently approximating the trace of $f(A)$ and identify how this approach is related to established (stochastic) probing methods for trace estimation. Another application area in which our approach works particularly well is the computation of functions of Toeplitz matrices. Here, studying the sparsity pattern of $p(A)$ allows us to reduce the computation of the whole matrix polynomial to that of a single small-scale submatrix, yielding an algorithm that scales exceptionally well to large problem sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs): deep neural networks (DNNs) architectures motivated by fixed-point iteration schemes for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm integral equations (FIEs) of the second kind. We also show how the proposed framework can be used for the solution of inverse problems. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>On the loss of orthogonality in low-synchronization variants of reorthogonalized block classical Gram-Schmidt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in communication-avoiding orthogonalization schemes for high-performance computing has been growing recently. This manuscript addresses open questions about the numerical stability of various block classical Gram-Schmidt variants that have been proposed in the past few years. An abstract framework is employed, the flexibility of which allows for new rigorous bounds on the loss of orthogonality in these variants. We first analyze a generalization of (reorthogonalized) block classical Gram-Schmidt and show that a "strong" intrablock orthogonalization routine is only needed for the very first block in order to maintain orthogonality on the level of the unit roundoff. In particular, this ``strong" first step does not have to be a reorthogonalized QR itself and subsequent steps can use less stable QR variants, thus keeping the overall communication costs low.
  Then, using this variant, which has four synchronization points per block column, we remove the synchronization points one at a time and analyze how each alteration affects the stability of the resulting method. Our analysis shows that the variant requiring only one synchronization per block column cannot be guaranteed to be stable in practice, as stability begins to degrade with the first reduction of synchronization points.
  Our analysis of block methods also provides new theoretical results for the single-column case. In particular, it is proven that DCGS2 from [Bielich, D. et al. Par. Comput. 112 (2022)] and CGS-2 from [\'{S}wirydowicz, K. et al, Num. Lin. Alg. Appl. 28 (2021)] are as stable as Householder QR. Numerical examples from the BlockStab toolbox are included throughout, to help compare variants and illustrate the effects of different choices of intraorthogonalization subroutines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new stable variational formulation for the quad-div problem in three dimensions and prove its well-posedness. Using this weak form, we develop and analyze the $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{grad-div})$-conforming virtual element method of arbitrary approximation orders on polyhedral meshes. Three families of $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{grad-div})$-conforming virtual elements are constructed based on the structure of a de Rham sub-complex with enhanced smoothness, resulting in an exact discrete virtual element complex. In the lowest-order case, the simplest element has only one degree of freedom at each vertex and face, respectively. We rigorously prove the interpolation error estimates, the stability of discrete bilinear forms, the well-posedness of discrete formulation and the optimal error estimates. Some numerical examples are shown to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singular value decomposition (SVD) allows to write a matrix as a product of a left singular vectors matrix, a nonnegative singular values diagonal matrix and a right singular vectors matrix. Among the applications of the SVD are the principal component analysis, the low-rank matrix approximation and the solving of a linear system of equations. The methods used for computing this decomposition allow to get the complete or partial result. For very large size matrix, the probabilistic methods allow to get partial result by using less computational load. A power method is proposed in this paper for computing all or the $k$ first largest SVD subspaces for a real-valued matrix. The $k$ first right singular vectors of this method are the $k$ columns of a neural network encoder weight matrix. The accuracy of this iterative search method depends on the behavior of the singular values and the settings of the gradient search optimizer used. A R package implementing the proposed method is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psvd/index.html.</description>

      <title>A block-acoustic preconditioner for the elastic Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel block-preconditioner for the elastic Helmholtz equation, based on a reduction to acoustic Helmholtz equations. Both versions of the Helmholtz equations are challenging numerically. The elastic Helmholtz equation is larger, as a system of PDEs, and harder to solve due to its more complicated physics. It was recently suggested that the elastic Helmholtz equation can be reformulated as a generalized saddle-point system, opening the door to the current development. Utilizing the approximate commutativity of the underlying differential operators, we suggest a block-triangular preconditioner whose diagonal blocks are acoustic Helmholtz operators. Thus, we enable the solution of the elastic version using virtually any existing solver for the acoustic version as a black-box. We prove a sufficient condition for the convergence of our method, that sheds light on the long questioned role of the commutator in the convergence of approximate commutator preconditioners. We show scalability of our preconditioner with respect to the Poisson ratio and with respect to the grid size. We compare our approach, combined with multigrid solve of each block, to a recent monolithic multigrid method for the elastic Helmholtz equation. The block-acoustic multigrid achieves a lower computational cost for various heterogeneous media, and a significantly lower memory consumption, compared to the monolithic approach. It results in a fast solution method for wave propagation problems in challenging heterogeneous media in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation in fluid flow models from undersampled frequency space data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4D Flow MRI is the state of the art technique for measuring blood flow, and it provides valuable information for inverse problems in the cardiovascular system. However, 4D Flow MRI has a very long acquisition time, straining healthcare resources and inconveniencing patients. Due to this, usually only a part of the frequency space is acquired, where then further assumptions need to be made in order to obtain an image.
  Inverse problems from 4D Flow MRI data have the potential to compute clinically relevant quantities without the need for invasive procedures, and/or expanding the set of biomarkers for a more accurate diagnosis. However, reconstructing MRI measurements with Compressed Sensing techniques introduces artifacts and inaccuracies, which can compromise the results of the inverse problems. Additionally, there is a high number of different sampling patterns available, and it is often unclear which of them is preferable.
  Here, we present a parameter estimation problem directly using highly undersampled frequency space measurements. This problem is numerically solved by a Reduced-Order Unscented Kalman Filter (ROUKF). We show that this results in more accurate parameter estimation for boundary conditions in a synthetic aortic blood flow than using measurements reconstructed with Compressed Sensing.
  We also compare different sampling patterns, demonstrating how the quality of the parameter estimation depends on the choice of the sampling pattern. The results show a considerably higher accuracy than an inverse problem using velocity measurements reconstructed via compressed sensing. Finally, we confirm these findings on real MRI data from a mechanical phantom.</description>

      <title>Time discretization in convected linearized thermo-visco-elastodynamics at large displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fully-implicit time discretization (i.e. the backward Euler formula) is applied to compressible nonlinear dynamical models of thermo-viscoelastic solids in the Eulerian description, i.e. in the actual deforming configuration, formulated in terms of rates. The Kelvin-Voigt rheology or also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology (which covers creep or plasticity) are considered, using the additive Green-Naghdi decomposition of total strain into the elastic and the inelastic strains formulated in terms of (objective) rates exploiting the Zaremba-Jaumann time derivative. A linearized convective model at large displacements is considered, focusing on the case where the internal energy additively splits the (convex) mechanical and the thermal parts.A fully implicit time-discrete scheme is devised. Considering the multipolar 2nd-grade viscosity, the numerical stability and convergence towards weak solutions are proven by exploiting, in particular, the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum instead of velocity and by estimating the temperature gradient from the entropy-like inequality.</description>

      <title>Robust semi-implicit multilevel SDC methods for conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-implicit multilevel spectral deferred correction (SI-MLSDC) methods provide a promising approach for high-order time integration for nonlinear evolution equations including conservation laws. However, existing methods lack robustness and often do not achieve the expected advantage over single-level SDC. This work adopts the novel SI time integrators from [48] for enhanced stability and extends the single-level SI-SDC method with a multilevel approach to increase computational efficiency. The favourable properties of the resulting SI-MLSDC method are shown by linear temporal stability analysis for a convection-diffusion problem. The robustness and efficiency of the fully discrete method involving a high-order discontinuous Galerkin SEM discretization are demonstrated through numerical experiments for the convection-diffusion, Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The method is shown to yield substantial reductions in fine-grid iterations compared to single-level SI-SDC across a broad range of test cases. Finally, current limitations of the SI-MLSDC framework are identified and discussed, providing guidance for future improvements.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schr\"odinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schr\"odinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schr\"odingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schr\"odingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</description>

      <title>An additive two-level parallel variant of the DMRG algorithm with coarse-space correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a popular alternating minimization scheme for solving high-dimensional optimization problems in the tensor train format. Classical DMRG, however, is based on sequential minimization, which raises challenges in its implementation on parallel computing architectures. To overcome this, we propose a novel additive two-level DMRG algorithm that combines independent, local minimization steps with a global update step using a subsequent coarse-space minimization. Our proposed algorithm, which is directly inspired by additive Schwarz methods from the domain decomposition literature, is particularly amenable to implementation on parallel, distributed architectures since both the local minimization steps and the construction of the coarse-space can be performed in parallel. Numerical experiments on strongly correlated molecular systems demonstrate that the method achieves competitive convergence rates while achieving significant parallel speedups.</description>

      <title>IG-PINNs: Interface-gated physics-informed neural networks for solving elliptic interface problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop interface-gated physics-informed neural networks (IG-PINNs) to solve elliptic interface equations. In IG-PINNs, we use a fully connected neural network to capture the smooth behavior across the entire domain. In each subdomain separated by the interface, an interface-gated network is utilized to provide corrections at the interface. In the architectural design of the interface-gated network, we introduce a gating mechanism and a level-set function derived from the interface. This design enables the interface-gated network to effectively handle discontinuous jumps across the interface. Some numerical experiments have confirmed the effectiveness of the IG-PINNs, demonstrating higher accuracy compared with PINNs, interface PINNs (I-PINNs) and multi-domain PINNs (M-PINNs).</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks for forward and inverse problems in elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network (DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bias-variance tradeoff within a multiscale approximation framework. Our approach utilizes a given quasi-approximation operator that is repeatedly applied in an error-correction scheme over a hierarchical data structure. We introduce a new bias measure, the bias ratio, to quantitatively assess the improvements afforded by multiscale approximations and demonstrate that this strategy effectively reduces the bias component of the approximation error, thereby providing a more flexible and robust framework for addressing scattered-data approximation problems. Our findings exhibit consistent bias decay across various scenarios, including applications to manifold-valued functions.</description>

Abstract: The block structure of double saddle-point problems has prompted extensive research into efficient preconditioners. This paper introduces a novel class of three-by-three block preconditioners tailored for such systems from the time-dependent Maxwell equations or liquid crystal director modeling. The main motivation of this work is to highlight the limitations of recent preconditioners under high Reynolds numbers, as the original studies did not explore this scenario, and to demonstrate that our preconditioner outperforms the existing ones in such regimes. We thoroughly analyze the convergence and spectral properties of the proposed preocnditioner. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners, and verify the theoretical bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While interpolatory bases such as the Lagrange basis form the cornerstone of classical finite element methods, they have been replaced in the more general finite element setting of isogeometric analysis in favor of other desirable properties. Yet, interpolation is a key property for devising accurate mass lumping strategies that are ubiquitous in explicit dynamic analyses of structures. In this article, we explore the possibility of restoring interpolation for spline bases within isogeometric analysis for the purpose of mass lumping. Although reminiscent of the spectral element method, this technique comes with its lot of surprises and challenges, which are critically assessed.</description>

Abstract: We consider numerical resolution of principal-agent (PA) problems in continuous time. We formulate a generic PA model with continuous and lump payments and a multi-dimensional strategy of the agent. To tackle the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with an implicit Hamiltonian we develop a novel deep learning method: the Deep Principal-Agent Actor Critic (DeepPAAC) Actor-Critic algorithm. DeepPAAC is able to handle multi-dimensional states and controls, as well as constraints. We investigate the role of the neural network architecture, training designs, loss functions, etc. on the convergence of the solver, presenting five different case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a finite element and virtual element (FE-VE) coupled method for thermomechanical analysis in electronic packaging structures. The approach partitions computational domains strategically, employing FEM for regular geometries to maximize computational efficiency and VEM for complex shapes to enhance geometric flexibility. Interface compatibility is maintained through coincident nodal correspondence, ensuring solution continuity across domain boundaries while reducing meshing complexity and computational overhead. Validation through electronic packaging applications demonstrates reasonable agreement with reference solutions and acceptable convergence characteristics across varying mesh densities. The method effectively captures thermal distributions and stress concentrations in multi-material systems, establishing a practical computational framework for electronic packaging analysis involving complex geometries.

Abstract: This paper investigates the mean-square exponential stability of neutral stochastic differential delay equations (NSDDEs) with Markovian switching. The analysis addresses the complexities arising from the interaction between the neutral term, time-varying delays, and structural changes governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. We establish novel and practical criteria for the mean-square exponential stability of both the underlying system and its numerical approximations via the Euler-Maruyama method. Furthermore, we prove that the numerical scheme can reproduce the exponential decay rate of the true solution with arbitrary accuracy, provided the step size is sufficiently small. The theoretical results are supported by a numerical example that illustrates their effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation (SCHE) driven by additive space-time white noise. We first refine the analytical ergodic theory by proving that the continuum equation admits a unique invariant measure in the more regular state space H_\alpha, extending the classical result of Da Prato and Debussche (1996) on the negative Sobolev space $\dot{H}^{-1}_\alpha$. To approximate long-time behaviour, we introduce an explicit fully discrete scheme that combines a finite-difference spatial discretization with a strongly tamed exponential Euler method in time. Uniform-in-time moment bounds in the $L^\infty$-norm are established for the numerical solution, and a uniform strong convergence estimate with an explicit rate is derived for the fully discrete approximation. Exploiting a mass-preserving minorization tailored to Neumann boundary conditions, we further show that the numerical scheme is geometrically ergodic and possesses a unique invariant measure, together with polynomial-order error bounds for approximating the exact invariant measure. Strong laws of large numbers are proved for both the continuous and discrete systems, ensuring almost-sure convergence of temporal averages to the corresponding ergodic limits. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, including the long-time strong convergence and the accuracy of invariant measure approximation. Overall, the results provide a complete analytical and numerical framework for investigating the long-time statistical behaviour of the SCHE.</description>

      <title>Compressing multivariate functions with tree tensor networks</title>

Abstract: Tensor networks are a compressed format for multi-dimensional data. One-dimensional tensor networks -- often referred to as tensor trains (TT) or matrix product states (MPS) -- are increasingly being used as a numerical ansatz for continuum functions by ``quantizing'' the inputs into discrete binary digits. Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.</description>

      <title>Fast prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>

Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>Simulating Clifford Circuits with Gaussian Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06127</link>

Abstract: Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Variance-Covariance Matrix Construction Using an Uncentered Gram Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reichel (2025) defined the bariance as a pairwise-difference measure that can be rewritten in linear time using only scalar sums. We extend this idea to the covariance matrix by showing that the standard matrix expression involving the uncentered Gram matrix and a correction term is algebraically identical to the pairwise-difference definition while avoiding explicit centering. The computation then reduces to one outer product of dimension p-by-p and a single subtraction. Benchmarks in Python show clear runtime gains, especially when BLAS optimizations are absent. Optionally faster Gram-matrix routines such as RXTX (Rybin et al., 2025) further reduce overall cost.</description>
