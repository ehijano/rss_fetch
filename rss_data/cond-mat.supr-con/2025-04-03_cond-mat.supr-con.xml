      <title>An Overview of Josephson Junctions Based QPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processing units (QPUs) based on superconducting Josephson junctions promise significant advances in quantum computing. However, they face critical challenges. Decoherence, scalability limitations, and error correction overhead hinder practical, fault-tolerant implementations. This paper investigates these issues by exploring both fundamental quantum phenomena and practical engineering challenges. We analyze key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, entanglement, and decoherence that govern the behavior of superconducting qubits. We also discuss quantum tunneling, Cooper pair formation, and the operational mechanics of Josephson junctions in detail. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis with alternative architectures, including ion trap and photonic systems. This comparison highlights the unique advantages and trade-offs of Josephson junction-based QPUs. Our findings emphasize the critical role of material innovations and optimized control techniques. These advances are essential for mitigating noise and decoherence and for realizing robust, scalable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the Medium-Entropy/High-Entropy Re-based Alloys with a Non-Centrosymmetric $\alpha$-Mn Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium or high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) and rhenium-based compounds with a non-centrosymmetric (NC) structure have received a lot of attention for offering a fertile soil in search for unconventional superconductivity. Here, five previously unreported NC Re-based MEA-HEA superconductors with an $\alpha$-Mn lattice are successfully synthesized, with their superconducting transition temperatures (Tcs) ranging from 4 to 5 K. An increase in the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) can be achieved by modulating the valence electron count (VEC) through compositional adjustments. Magnetization measurements confirm that all the synthesized Re-based MEA-HEAs are bulk type-II superconductors. Specific heat analysis reveals that the superconducting state of these HEAs can be well described by a single-gap s-wave model. Our results show that the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of these $\alpha$-Mn MEA/HEA superconductors are close to the typical value of heavy fermion compounds, suggesting the existence of strong electronic correlation. These findings provide promising material platforms to study the role of high disorder in the origin of superconductivity in the NC MEAs-HEAs.</description>

      <title>Enhanced coherent terahertz emission from critical superconducting fluctuations in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent terahertz (THz) emission is emerging as a powerful new tool to probe symmetry breakings in quantum materials. This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous vortex Hall effect in a ferromagnet/superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is a fascinating and complex phenomenon in condensed matter physics, as these two states are typically mutually exclusive due to their competing spin configurations. However, the interplay between these two orders through the proximity effect has been a subject of intense research as it opens up possibilities for novel technological applications. Here, we report the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in superconducting {\delta}-TaN/ferromagnetic CoFeB heterostructures grown by facing-target sputtering. Superconducting states are comprehensively investigated, with evidence of strong correlation between the superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. In particular, we observed an anomalous Hall signal without the presence of the magnetic field in the mixed state of the superconducting transition near the critical temperature. Systematic characterizations of the Hall resistance under varying temperatures and magnetic fields attribute this behavior to the vortex Hall effect (VHE), whereby superconducting vortices in the mixed state undergo transverse motions near the critical temperature. Unlike previously reported VHEs in conventional type-II superconductors, the anomalous VHE in TaN is induced by the stray field in the underlying CoFeB layers. The concurrency of strong spin-orbit coupling, the superconductivity in the TaN layer, and the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic ordering in the CoFeB layer offers new insights into proximity-induced vortex dynamics and the design of novel superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamics on the picosecond timescale in a superconducting synapse structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are running into limitations in terms of training time and energy. Following the principles of the human brain, spiking neural networks trained with unsupervised learning offer a faster, more energy-efficient alternative. However, the dynamics of spiking, learning, and forgetting become more complicated in such schemes. Here we study a superconducting electronics implementation of a learning synapse and experimentally measure its spiking dynamics. By pulsing the system with a superconducting neuron, we show that a superconducting inductor can dynamically hold the synaptic weight with updates due to learning and forgetting. Learning can be stopped by slowing down the arrival time of the post-synaptic pulse, in accordance with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity paradigm. We find excellent agreement with circuit simulations, and by fitting the turn-on of the pulsing frequency, we confirm a learning time of 16.1 +/- 1 ps. The power dissipation in the learning part of the synapse is less than one attojoule per learning event. This leads to the possibility of an extremely fast and energy-efficient learning processor.</description>

      <title>Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.</description>

      <title>Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. Here, we show that the LC order fundamentally changes the nature of the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In a single-orbital model on the kagome lattice near van Hove filling, the LC CDW is a Chern metal, realizable in concrete models, with a partially filled Chern band hosting three Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). We show that Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs is described by three SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings due to LC. The pairing instability is determined by the eigenvalues of the complex representation of the cubic group. We show that the Josephson phase is controlled by the discrete quantum geometry associated with the sublattice permutation group. A small LC can produce a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to a roton superconductor, where the internal phases of the three SC components are locked at 120^\circ and loop supercurrents circulate around an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. We demonstrate by self-consistent calculations the properties of the roton superconductor and make theoretical predictions related to the recent experimental evidence for an exotic SC state in CsV3Sb5 exhibiting TRS breaking, anisotropic SC gap, pair density wave modulations, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems such as the moire structures.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Diffusional Hydrogen Escape in High-$T_c$ Superconducting Calcium Superhydride at Megabar Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-pressure metal superhydrides have attracted intense scientific interest due to their remarkable superconducting properties. While superconductivity is known to be sensitive to material composition, compositional variability is often overlooked in metal superhydrides at megabar pressures. Using ab initio path-integral simulations, we find that up to 7 % of the hydrogen atoms escape from the 215-kelvin superconducting CaH$_6$ upon decompression from 165 to 123 GPa. This loss of hydrogen leads to an elastic instability at low pressures, an "abnormal" positive pressure dependence of the superconducting $T_c$ and a quantum phase transition from a mixed superconducting-diffusive state to a pure superconducting phase. In this mixed phase, proton diffusivity reaches $10^{-8}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at low temperatures and promotes to $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at room temperature, which elucidates the escape of hydrogen at megabar pressures. Our results are consistent with many "anomalous" experimental observations and highlight the significance of composition effects in high-$T_c$ metal superhydrides.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</description>

      <title>Topological Majorana zero modes and the superconducting diode effect driven by Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing in a helical Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in our system where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the presence of finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO ground state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the superconducting diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Surface-dependent Majorana vortex phases in topological crystalline insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits two types of surface Dirac cones: one located at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (001) and (110) surfaces, and the other at time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (111) surface. Motivated by the recent experimental evidence of Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) and their hybridization on the (001) surface [Nature 633, 71 (2024)], we present a comprehensive investigation of Majorana vortex phases in SnTe, including topological classification, surface-state Hamiltonians analysis, and lattice model calculations. By utilizing rotational and magnetic mirror symmetries, we present two equivalent methods to reveal the topology of Majorana phases on different surfaces. We find that the MVEMs on the (001) and (110) surfaces are protected by both magnetic group and rotational symmetries. In contrast, the MVEMs on the (111) surface are protected by magnetic group or particle-hole symmetry. Due to the different properties of Dirac fermions in the $\bar{\Gamma}$ and $\bar{M}$ valleys on the (111) surfaces, including Fermi velocities and energy levels, we find that abundant vortex phase transitions can occur for the [111]-direction vortex. As the chemical potential increases, the number of robust MVEMs can change from $0\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2$. These vortex transitions are characterized by both $Z$ winding number and $Z_2$ pfaffian topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Electronic structures and multi-orbital models of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks a significant breakthrough in the field of nickelate superconductors. Using density functional theory (DFT), we propose a double-stacked two-orbital effective model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin film based on the Ni$-e_g$ orbitals. Our analysis of the Fermi surface reveals three electron pockets ($\alpha,\alpha^{\prime},\beta$) and two hole pockets ($\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}$), where the additional $\alpha^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime}$ pockets arise from inter-stack interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a high-energy model that incorporates O$-p$ orbitals to facilitate future studies. Calculations of spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation (RPA) indicate that magnetic correlations are enhanced by nesting of the $\gamma$ pocket, which is predominantly derived from the Ni$-d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films.</description>

      <title>Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</description>
