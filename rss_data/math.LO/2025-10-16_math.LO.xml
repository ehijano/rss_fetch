      <title>Amorphous sets and dual Dedekind finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $A$ is dually Dedekind finite if every surjection from $A$ onto $A$ is injective; otherwise, $A$ is dually Dedekind infinite. An amorphous set is an infinite set that cannot be partitioned into two infinite subsets. A strictly amorphous set is an amorphous set in which every partition has only finitely many non-singleton blocks. It is proved consistent with $\mathsf{ZF}$ (i.e., the Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice) that there exists an amorphous set $A$ whose power set $\mathscr{P}(A)$ is dually Dedekind infinite, which gives a negative solution to a question proposed by Truss [J. Truss, Fund. Math. 84, 187--208 (1974)]. Nevertheless, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ that, for all strictly amorphous sets $A$ and all natural numbers $n$, $\mathscr{P}(A)^n$ is dually Dedekind finite, which generalizes a result of Goldstern.</description>

      <title>The structure of subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12867v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a subset of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension at most $k$ is well approximated by a union of atoms of a quadratic factor of complexity $(\ell,q)$ (denoting the complexities of the linear and quadratic part, respectively), where $\ell$ and $q$ are bounded by a constant depending only on $k$ and the desired level of approximation. This generalises a result of Alon, Fox and Zhao on the structure of sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension, and is analogous to contemporaneous work of the authors arXiv:2111.01737 in the setting of 3-uniform hypergraphs.
  The main result originally appeared--albeit with a different proof--in a 2021 preprint arXiv:2111.01739, which has since been split into two: the present work, which focuses on higher arity NIP and develops a theory of local uniformity semi-norms of possibly independent interest, and its companion arXiv:2111.01739, which strengthens these results under a generalized notion of stability.</description>

      <title>Higher presentable categories and limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stefanich generalized the notion of (locally) presentable $(\infty, 1)$-category to the notion of presentable $(\infty, n)$-category. We give a new description based on the new notion of $\kappa$-compactly generated $(\infty, n)$-category, which avoids universe enlargement.
  Using the new definition, we prove the underlying functor of a morphism between presentable $(\infty, 2)$-categories has a right adjoint. In particular, any presentable $(\infty, 2)$-category has limits. We also prove that this fails drastically when we go higher: The unit presentable $(\infty, 3)$-category, i.e., the category of presentable $(\infty, 2)$-categories, does not have limits. This settles Stefanich's conjecture in the negative.</description>

      <title>A Tame Generic Structure with Non-Algebraic Geometric Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By providing a procedure to apply Hrushovski's amalgamation method to the setting of classes of infinite structures, we introduce the notion of \textit{paracollapsed} structures. We show that this approach provides existentially closed generic structures in which the geometric closure is not included in the algebraic closure while the resulting theory is decidable. We show that paracollapsed structures have the strict order property and $\text{TP}_2$.</description>

      <title>Projective curves and weak second-order logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic zero, we study the incidence relation between points and irreducible projective curves, or more precisely the poset of irreducible proper subvarieties of $\mathbb P^2(K)$. Answering a question of Marcus Tressl, we prove that the poset interprets the field, and it is in fact bi-interpretable with the two-sorted structure consisting of the field $K$ and a sort for its finite subsets. In this structure one can define the integers, so the theory is undecidable. When $K$ is the field of complex numbers we can nevertheless obtain a recursive axiomatization modulo the theory of the integers. We also show that the integers are stably embedded and that the poset of irreducible varieties over the complex numbers is not elementarily equivalent to the one over the algebraic numbers.</description>

      <title>The class of Aronszajn lines under epimorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear order $A$ is called strongly surjective if for every non empty suborder $B \preceq A$, there is an epimorphism from $A$ onto $B$ (denoted by $B \trianglelefteq A$). We show, answering some questions of D\'aniel T. Soukup, that under $\mathsf{MA}_{\aleph_{1}}$ there is a strongly surjective Countryman line. We also study the general structure of the class of Aronszajn lines under $\trianglelefteq$, and compare it with the well known embeddability relation $\preceq$. Under $\mathsf{PFA}$, the class of Aronszajn lines and the class of countable linear orders enjoy similar nice properties when viewed under the embeddability relation; both are well-quasi-ordered and have a finite basis. We show that this analogy does not extend perfectly to the $\trianglelefteq$ relation; while it is known that the countable linear orders are still well-quasi-ordered under $\trianglelefteq$, we show that already in $\mathsf{ZFC}$ the class of Aronszajn lines has an infinite antichain, and under $\mathsf{MA}_{\aleph_{1}}$ an infinite decreasing chain as well. We show that some of the analogy survives by proving that under $\mathsf{PFA}$, for some carefully constructed Countryman line $C$, $C$ and $C^{\star}$ form a $\trianglelefteq$-basis for the class of Aronszajn lines. Finally we show that this does not extend to all uncountable linear orders by proving that there is never a finite $\trianglelefteq$-basis for the uncountable real orders.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of stronger lower bounds for NEXP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.</description>

      <title>A meta-modal logic for bisimulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modal study of the notion of bisimulation. Our contribution is twofold. First, we extend the basic modal language with a new modality [b], whose intended meaning is universal quantification over all states that are bisimilar to the current one. We show that bisimulations are definable in this object language. Second, we provide a sound and complete axiomatisation of the class of all pairs of Kripke models linked by bisimulations.</description>

      <title>Higher-arity PAC learning, VC dimension and packing lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to overview some of our work in Chernikov, Towsner'20 (arXiv:2010.00726) developing higher arity VC theory (VC$_n$ dimension), including a generalization of Haussler packing lemma, and an associated tame (slice-wise) hypergraph regularity lemma; and to demonstrate that it characterizes higher arity PAC learning (PAC$_n$ learning) in $n$-fold product spaces with respect to product measures introduced by Kobayashi, Kuriyama and Takeuchi'15. We also point out how some of the recent results in arXiv:2402.14294, arXiv:2505.15688, arXiv:2509.20404 follow from our work in arXiv:2010.00726.</description>
