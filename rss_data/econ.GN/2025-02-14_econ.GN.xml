      <title>Blockchain-based Ecommerce It's an Evolution NOT a Revolution-Experimental Evidence from Users' Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proponents of blockchains believe that this technology will revolutionize e-commerce. To evaluate this belief, we invite several groups of students to transact on a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace built on the platform provided by Origin Protocol Inc., and then we conduct a survey about their experience of usage. Based on our survey results, we find that 33% of respondents play tricks on others, which implies that this undesirable result may hinder the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. We also attempt to propose a conceptual mechanism to mitigate fraudulent behaviors. In the event of disputation, a trusted authority is entitled to the right to downgrade the fraudulent side's credit record, which is stored by a permissioned blockchain accessed only by the authority. Such a punishment can effectively decrease agents' incentives to sell counterfeits and leave fake ratings. In sum, we must distinguish what we proposed blockchains will do and what blockchains can do before enabling this technology in e-commerce.</description>

      <title>Using Covid-19 Response Policy to Estimate Open Water Swim Drafting Effects in Triathlon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal effects of open-water swim drafting by leveraging a natural experiment induced by staggered race starts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before 2020, athletes started in groups, enabling drafting benefits, while pandemic-related restrictions significantly reduced these opportunities. Using agglomerative hierarchical clustering of swim-out times, I analyze optimal drafting positions and estimate their impact on Swim-Out performance. Our empirical findings reveal that swim drafting benefits were statistically insignificant in 2020 but persisted post-pandemic at slightly reduced levels. I find that drafting becomes advantageous only from the third trailing position onward, with earlier positions primarily serving to minimize fatigue. To mitigate endogeneity, I employ athlete and event fixed effects. The seemingly inverse decaying nature of drafting benefits partially addresses some concerns of simultaneous reverse causality and omitted variable bias. This study provides the first largescale causal estimate of drafting effects in real-world triathlon race settings.</description>

      <title>Trade and pollution: Evidence from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What happens to pollution when developing countries open their borders to trade? Theoretical predictions are ambiguous, and empirical evidence remains limited. We study the effects of the 1991 Indian trade liberalization reform on water pollution. The reform abruptly and unexpectedly lowered import tariffs, increasing exposure to trade. Larger tariff reductions are associated with relative increases in water pollution. The estimated effects imply a 0.12 standard deviation increase in water pollution for the median district exposed to the tariff reform.</description>

      <title>Capitalizing on a Crisis: A Computational Analysis of all Five Million British Firms During the Covid-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes to business ownership in the UK which affects a generation of entrepreneurs and their employees. Nonetheless, the impact remains poorly understood. This is because research on capital accumulation has typically lacked high-quality, individualized, population-level data. We overcome these barriers to examine who benefits from economic crises through a computationally orientated lens of firm creation. Leveraging a comprehensive cache of administrative data on every UK firm and all nine million people running them, combined with probabilistic algorithms, we conduct individual-level analyzis to understand who became Covid entrepreneurs. Using these techniques, we explore characteristics of entrepreneurs--such as age, gender, region, business experience, and industry--which potentially predict Covid entrepreneurship. By employing an automated time series model selection procedure to generate counterfactuals, we show that Covid entrepreneurs were typically aged 35-49 (40.4%), men (73.1%), and had previously held roles in existing firms (59.4%). For most industries, growth was disproportionately concentrated around London. It was therefore existing corporate elites who were most able to capitalize on the Covid crisis and not, as some hypothesized, young entrepreneurs who were setting up their first businesses. In this respect, the pandemic will likely impact future wealth inequalities. Our work offers methodological guidance for future policymakers during economic crises and highlights the long-term consequences for capital and wealth inequality.</description>

      <title>Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In combinatorial auctions, participants can bid on packages of goods rather than just individual items. To maximize welfare, the auctioneer must ensure that bid formats are available that allow agents to communicate their preferences as accurately as possible. Electricity auctions, where participants trade power for future periods, are often combinatorial due to intertemporal constraints governing production and consumption. In Europe, the XOR package bid format lets bidders specify their willingness to buy or sell power profiles while ensuring that at most one profile is accepted (also known as an exclusive group of block bids). Unlike the parametric bid formats often employed in US power auctions, XOR package bids are technology-agnostic, making them particularly suitable for flexible, demand-side participants. However, to mitigate excessive computational complexity, auctioneers must limit the number of package bids that agents are allowed to submit. Such restrictions prevent participants from fully expressing their preferences, potentially reducing profits and diminishing overall welfare. To address this issue, we propose decision support algorithms that optimize package bid selection, evaluate welfare losses resulting from bid limitations, and explore alternative bid formats. Our findings offer actionable insights for both auctioneers and agents.</description>

      <title>Cracking the Code: Enhancing Development finance understanding with artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing development projects is crucial for understanding donors aid strategies, recipients priorities, and to assess development finance capacity to adress development issues by on-the-ground actions. In this area, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments (OECD) Creditor Reporting System (CRS) dataset is a reference data source. This dataset provides a vast collection of project narratives from various sectors (approximately 5 million projects). While the OECD CRS provides a rich source of information on development strategies, it falls short in informing project purposes due to its reporting process based on donors self-declared main objectives and pre-defined industrial sectors. This research employs a novel approach that combines Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), an innovative Python topic modeling technique called BERTopic, to categorise (cluster) and label development projects based on their narrative descriptions. By revealing existing yet hidden topics of development finance, this application of artificial intelligence enables a better understanding of donor priorities and overall development funding and provides methods to analyse public and private projects narratives.</description>

      <title>Assessing Generative AI value in a public sector context: evidence from a field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) has motivated an interest in understanding how it could be used to enhance productivity across various tasks. We add to research results for the performance impact of Gen AI on complex knowledge-based tasks in a public sector setting. In a pre-registered experiment, after establishing a baseline level of performance, we find mixed evidence for two types of composite tasks related to document understanding and data analysis. For the Documents task, the treatment group using Gen AI had a 17% improvement in answer quality scores (as judged by human evaluators) and a 34% improvement in task completion time compared to a control group. For the Data task, we find the Gen AI treatment group experienced a 12% reduction in quality scores and no significant difference in mean completion time compared to the control group. These results suggest that the benefits of Gen AI may be task and potentially respondent dependent. We also discuss field notes and lessons learned, as well as supplementary insights from a post-trial survey and feedback workshop with participants.</description>

      <title>Cultural Transmission, Property Rights, and Treatment of the Elderly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how production and the development of property rights interact with cultural transmission to shape the treatment of the elderly across societies. Our model posits that respect for the elderly arises endogenously: parents invest in cultivating cultural values in their children, who later reciprocate in proportion to this investment. We show that this model is functionally equivalent to one in which cultural goods are transferred by the elderly. We focus on the distinct roles of property rights, finding that while insecure output rights may promote elderly welfare, secure rights over productive resources can have comparable benefits. The model reveals a nonlinear relationship between cultural sophistication, property rights, and economic factors such as the capital and land intensity of production, driving variations in elderly well-being across societies. Finally, we consider how the model suggests demographic, technological, and policy changes influence elderly well-being across the spectrum of development.</description>

      <title>Skill-Based Labor Market Polarization in the Age of AI: A Comparative Analysis of India and the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines labor market polarization through a comparative analysis of skill-based employment and wage distributions in India and the United States during 2018-2023, with particular attention to differential automation risks and AI preparedness. Using detailed occupation-level data, automation risk metrics, and a series of statistical tests including wage premium analysis, employment share tests, and wage-employment regressions, we document significant structural differences in labor markets between developing and developed economies. Our analysis yields four key findings. First, we find statistically significant differences in employment distribution patterns, with India showing disproportionate concentration in low-skill employment compared to the US, particularly in occupations with high automation risk. Second, regression analysis reveals that wage premiums differ systematically between the two countries, with significantly larger skill-based wage gaps in India. Third, we find robust evidence of a negative relationship between employment size and wages, suggesting stronger labor supply effects in developing economies. Fourth, analysis of occupation-specific automation risk reveals that developing economies face a "double vulnerability" - concentration of employment in both low-skill occupations and jobs with higher automation potential, complicated by lower AI preparedness scores. These findings provide novel empirical evidence on how development stages influence labor market polarization patterns and carry important implications for skill development and technology adoption policies in developing economies. Our results suggest that traditional approaches to labor market development may need significant modification to account for the differential impacts of AI across development stages.</description>

      <title>AI Oversight and Human Mistakes: Evidence from Centre Court</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powered by the increasing predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to overrule human mistakes in many settings. We provide the first field evidence that the use of AI oversight can impact human decision-making. We investigate one of the highest visibility settings where AI oversight has occurred: Hawk-Eye review of umpires in top tennis tournaments. We find that umpires lowered their overall mistake rate after the introduction of Hawk-Eye review, but also that umpires increased the rate at which they called balls in, producing a shift from making Type II errors (calling a ball out when in) to Type I errors (calling a ball in when out). We structurally estimate the psychological costs of being overruled by AI using a model of attention-constrained umpires, and our results suggest that because of these costs, umpires cared 37% more about Type II errors under AI oversight.</description>
