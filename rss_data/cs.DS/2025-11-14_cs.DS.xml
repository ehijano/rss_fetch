      <title>A Quasi-Polynomial Time Algorithm for 3-Coloring Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a circle graph if it is an intersection graph of chords of a unit circle. We give an algorithm that takes as input an $n$ vertex circle graph $G$, runs in time at most $n^{O(\log n)}$ and finds a proper $3$-coloring of $G$, if one exists. As a consequence we obtain an algorithm with the same running time to determine whether a given ordered graph $(G, \prec)$ has a $3$-page book embedding. This gives a partial resolution to the well known open problem of Dujmovi\'{c} and Wood [Discret. Math. Theor. Comput. Sci. 2004], Eppstein [2014], and Bachmann, Rutter and Stumpf [J. Graph Algorithms Appl. 2024] of whether 3-Coloring on circle graphs admits a polynomial time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Dynamic Tree Edit Distance and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String Edit Distance is a more-than-classical problem whose behavior in the dynamic setting, where the strings are updated over time, is well understood. A single character substitution, insertion, or deletion can be handled in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \cdot \min(\sqrt{n},w))$ time [Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, Mozes, CPM 2020], where $w$ is the maximum operation weight. This bound is optimal [Cassis, Kociumaka, Wellnitz, FOCS 2023] and provides a substantial improvement over the static $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm when few characters of the input string are updated.
  In contrast, for inherently related problems such as Tree Edit Distance, Dyck Edit Distance, and RNA Folding, it has remained unknown whether it is possible to devise dynamic algorithms with an advantage over the static algorithm. In this paper, we resolve this question by showing that (weighted) Tree Edit Distance, Dyck Edit Distance, and RNA Folding admit no dynamic speedup: under well-known fine-grained assumptions we show that the best possible algorithm recomputes the solution from scratch after each update. Furthermore, we prove a quadratic per-update lower bound for unweighted Tree Edit Distance under the $k$-Clique Conjecture. This provides the first separation between dynamic unweighted String Edit Distance and unweighted Tree Edit Distance, problems whose relative difficulty in the static setting is still open.</description>

      <title>Faster All-Pairs Minimum Cut: Bypassing Exact Max-Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-Pairs Minimum Cut (APMC) is a fundamental graph problem that asks to find a minimum $s,t$-cut for every pair of vertices $s,t$. A recent line of work on fast algorithms for APMC has culminated with a reduction of APMC to $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-many max-flow computations. But unfortunately, no fast algorithms are currently known for exact max-flow in several standard models of computation, such as the cut-query model and the fully-dynamic model.
  Our main technical contribution is a sparsifier that preserves all minimum $s,t$-cuts in an unweighted graph, and can be constructed using only approximate max-flow computations. We then use this sparsifier to devise new algorithms for APMC in unweighted graphs in several computational models: (i) a randomized algorithm that makes $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ cut queries to the input graph; (ii) a deterministic fully-dynamic algorithm with $n^{3/2+o(1)}$ worst-case update time; and (iii) a randomized two-pass streaming algorithm with space requirement $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. These results improve over the known bounds, even for (single pair) minimum $s,t$-cut in the respective models.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Complexity of Hedge Cluster Deletion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hedge graph is a graph whose edge set has been partitioned into groups called hedges. Here we consider a generalization of the well-known \textsc{Cluster Deletion} problem, named \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion}. The task is to compute the minimum number of hedges of a hedge graph so that their removal results in a graph that is isomorphic to a disjoint union of cliques. We show that for graphs that contain bounded size of vertex-disjoint 3-vertex-paths as subgraphs, \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} can be solved in polynomial time. Regarding its approximability, we prove that the problem is tightly connected to the related complexity of the \textsc{Min Horn Deletion} problem, a well-known boolean CSP problem. Our connection shows that it is NP-hard to approximate \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} within factor $2^{O(\log^{1-\epsilon} r)}$ for any $\epsilon &gt;0$, where $r$ is the number of hedges in a given hedge graph.
  Based on its classified (in)approximability and the difficulty imposed by the structure of almost all non-trivial graphs, we consider the hedge underlying structure. We give a polynomial-time algorithm with constant approximation ratio for \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} whenever each triangle of the input graph is covered by at most two hedges. On the way to this result, an interesting ingredient that we solved efficiently is a variant of the \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem in which apart from the desired vertex set that covers the edge set, a given set of vertex-constraints should also be included in the solution. Moreover, as a possible workaround for the existence of efficient exact algorithms, we propose the hedge intersection graph which is the intersection graph spanned by the hedges. Towards this direction, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} whenever the hedge intersection graph is acyclic.</description>

      <title>Testing H-freeness on sparse graphs, the case of bounded expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In property testing, a tester makes queries to (an oracle for) a graph and, on a graph having or being far from having a property P, it decides with high probability whether the graph satisfies P or not. Often, testers are restricted to a constant number of queries. While the graph properties for which there exists such a tester are somewhat well characterized in the dense graph model, it is not the case for sparse graphs. In this area, Czumaj and Sohler (FOCS'19) proved that H-freeness (i.e. the property of excluding the graph H as a subgraph) can be tested with constant queries on planar graphs as well as on graph classes excluding a minor.
  Using results from the sparsity toolkit, we propose a simpler alternative to the proof of Czumaj and Sohler, for a statement generalized to the broader notion of bounded expansion. That is, we prove that for any class C with bounded expansion and any graph H, testing H-freeness can be done with constant query complexity on any graph G in C, where the constant depends on H and C, but is independent of G.
  While classes excluding a minor are prime examples of classes with bounded expansion, so are, for example, cubic graphs, graph classes with bounded maximum degree, graphs of bounded book thickness, or random graphs of bounded average degree.</description>

      <title>Spectral and combinatorial methods for efficiently computing the rank of unambiguous finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A zero-one matrix is a matrix with entries from $\{0, 1\}$. We study monoids containing only such matrices. A finite set of zero-one matrices generating such a monoid can be seen as the matrix representation of an unambiguous finite automaton, an important generalisation of deterministic finite automata which shares many of their good properties.
  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of $n \times n$ zero-one matrices generating a monoid of zero-one matrices, and $m$ be the cardinality of $\mathcal{A}$. We study the computational complexity of computing the minimum rank of a matrix in the monoid generated by $\mathcal{A}$. By using linear-algebraic techniques, we show that this problem is in $\textsf{NC}$ and can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(mn^4)$ time. We also provide a combinatorial algorithm finding a matrix of minimum rank in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2 + \omega} + mn^4)$ time, where $2 \le \omega \le 2.4$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. As a byproduct, we show a very weak version of a generalisation of the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture: there always exists a straight line program of size $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ describing a product resulting in a matrix of minimum rank.
  For the special case corresponding to total DFAs (that is, for the case where all matrices have exactly one 1 in each row), the minimum rank is the size of the smallest image of the set of all states under the action of a word. Our combinatorial algorithm finds a matrix of minimum rank in time $\mathcal{O}(n^3 + mn^2)$ in this case.</description>

      <title>Is nasty noise actually harder than malicious noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $\eta$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $\eta$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $\eta_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $\eta_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $\eta$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $\eta/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.</description>

      <title>Learning Intersections of Halfspaces under Factorizable Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\gamma$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/\gamma))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/\gamma)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Distributed Distance Sensitivity Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for the distance sensitivity oracle (DSO) problem, where one needs to preprocess a given directed weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ in order to answer queries about the shortest path distance in $G$ from vertex $s$ to vertex $t$ avoiding edge $e$, for any $s,t \in V, e \in E$. DSO enables optimal re-routing under a link failure, and can serve as a key component for fault tolerance in a distributed setting. However, no non-trivial results for DSO are known in the distributed CONGEST model.
  We present DSO algorithms with different tradeoffs between preprocessing and query cost: one that optimizes query response rounds, and another that prioritizes preprocessing rounds. We complement these algorithms with unconditional CONGEST lower bounds for DSO. Our DSO lower bounds build on a lower bound we present for the $k$-source shortest paths problem ($k$-SSP), which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we present almost-optimal upper and lower bounds for the related all pairs second simple shortest path (2-APSiSP) problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This very preliminary text is related to ``Algorithms on Texts'', also called ``Algorithmic Stringology''. It is an extension of the book ``125 Problems in Text Algorithms'' providing, in the same compact style, more problems with solutions. We refer also to the companions to ``Text algorithms'' available at http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf and at the web page http://125-problems.univ-mlv.fr, where all 150 problems (including the ones presented here) are briefly announced. The selected problems satisfy three criteria: challenging, having short tricky solutions and solvable with only very basic background in stringology. For the basics in stringology we refer to http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf.</description>

      <title>Distribution Learning Meets Graph Structure Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a novel link between the problem of PAC-learning high-dimensional graphical models and the task of (efficient) counting and sampling of graph structures, using an online learning framework.
  We observe that if we apply the exponentially weighted average (EWA) or randomized weighted majority (RWM) forecasters on a sequence of samples from a distribution P using the log loss function, the average regret incurred by the forecaster's predictions can be used to bound the expected KL divergence between P and the predictions. Known regret bounds for EWA and RWM then yield new sample complexity bounds for learning Bayes nets. Moreover, these algorithms can be made computationally efficient for several interesting classes of Bayes nets. Specifically, we give a new sample-optimal and polynomial time learning algorithm with respect to trees of unknown structure and the first polynomial sample and time algorithm for learning with respect to Bayes nets over a given chordal skeleton.</description>

      <title>A new approach to bipartite stable matching optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a common generalization of previously solved optimization problems concerning bipartite stable matchings, we describe a strongly polynomial network flow based algorithm for computing $\ell$ disjoint stable matchings with minimum total cost. The major observation behind the approach is that stable matchings, as edge sets, can be represented as certain cuts of an associated directed graph. This allows us to use results on disjoint cuts directly to answer questions about disjoint stable matchings. We also provide a construction that represents stable matchings as maximum-size antichains in a partially ordered set (poset), which enables us to apply the theorems of Dilworth, Mirsky, Greene and Kleitman directly to stable matchings. Another consequence of these approaches is a min-max formula for the minimum number of stable matchings covering all stable edges.</description>
