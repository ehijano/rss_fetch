      <title>Seeing through the light cone: Visualizing electromagnetic fields in special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical framework of electromagnetism played a foundational role in Einstein's development of special relativity. To support conceptual understanding, we present a fully special relativistic computer simulation that visualizes electromagnetic fields from the perspective of a moving observer. In this simulation, the user observes electromagnetic phenomena through their past light cone and directly experiences the Lorentz force acting at that spacetime point. The electromagnetic field is computed from the subluminal motion of point charges at the intersection of their worldlines with the observer's past light cone, ensuring causal consistency and Lorentz covariance. This approach offers an interactive and intuitive representation of relativistic electromagnetism. It provides insight into how electric and magnetic fields transform across inertial frames, and serves as a bridge between abstract formalism and physical intuition. The simulation also lends itself to pedagogical use in courses on special relativity or electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Covariant Electromagnetism in Past-Light-Cone Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a manifestly covariant formulation of relativistic electromagnetism, focusing on the computation of electromagnetic fields from moving charges in a manifestly Lorentz-covariant manner. The electromagnetic field at a given spacetime point is determined by the motion of point charges at the intersection of their worldlines with the past light cone of the spacetime point, ensuring causal consistency. This formalism provides a manifestly covariant generalization of the Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials and allows direct implementation on computers. We compare our formulation with standard textbook approaches and analyze its behavior in various physical limits.</description>

      <title>Classical Dirac particle I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we produce a classical Lagrangian description of an elementary spinning particle which satisfies Dirac equation when quantized. We call this particle a classical Dirac particle. We analyze in detail the way we arrive to this model and how the different observables and constants of the motion can be expressed in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, by making use of Noether's theorem. The main feature is that the particle has a center of charge r, moving at the speed of light, that satisfies fourth-order diferential equations and all observables can be expressed only in terms of this point and their time derivatives. The particle has also a center of mass q, that is a different point than the center of charge. This implies that two different spin observables can be defined, one S with respect to the point r and another SCM with respect to the point q, that satisfy different dynamical equations. The spin S satisfies the same dynamical equation than Dirac's spin operator. The fourth-order differential equations for the point r can be transformed into a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the center of charge and center of mass. The dynamics can be described in terms of dimensionless variables. The possible interaction Lagrangians are described and we devote the main part of the work to the electromagnetic interaction of the Dirac particle with uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The numerical integrations of the dynamical equations are performed with different Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested reader.</description>
