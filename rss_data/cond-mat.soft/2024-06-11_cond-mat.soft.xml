      <title>A thermo-hygro computational model to determine the factors dictating cold joint formation in 3D printed concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold joints in extruded concrete structures form once the exposed surface of a deposited filament dries prematurely and gets sequentially covered by a layer of fresh concrete. This creates a material heterogeneity which lowers the structural durability and shortens the designed service life. Many factors concurrently affect cold joint formation, yet a suitable tool for their categorization is missing. Here, we present a computational model that simulates the drying kinetics at the exposed structural surface, accounting for cement hydration and the resulting microstructural development. The model provides a time estimate for cold joint formation as a result. It allows us to assess the drying severity for a given structure's geometry, its interaction with the environment, and ambient conditions. We evaluate the assessed factors and provide generalized recommendations for cold joint mitigation.</description>

      <title>MARTINI Coarse-grained Force Field for Thermoplastic Starch Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoplastic starch (TPS) is an excellent film-forming material, and adding fillers such as tetramethylammonium-montmorillonite (TMA-MMT) clay has significantly expanded its use in packaging applications. We first used all-atom (AA) simulation to predict several macroscopic (Young modulus, glass transition temperature, density) and microscopic (conformation along 1-4 and 1-6 glycosidic linkages, composite morphology) properties of TPS melt and TPS-TMA-MMT composite. The interplay of polymer-surface, plasticizer-surface, and polymer-plasticizer interactions leads to conformational and dynamic properties distinct from those in systems with either attractive or repulsive polymer-surface interactions. A subset of AA properties was used to parameterize the MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force field (FF) for the melt and composite systems. Specifically, we determined the missing bonded parameters of amylose and amylopectin and rationalized the bead types for 1-4 and 1-6 linked alpha-D glucose using two-body excess entropy, density, and bond and angle distributions in AA TPS melt. The MARTINI CG model for TPS was combined with an existing parameter set for TMA-MMT. The liquid-liquid partitioning-based MARTINI-2 FF shows freezing and compaction of polymer chains near the sheet surface, further accentuated by lowering of dispersive interactions between pairs of high covalent coordination ring units of TPS polymers and MMT sheet. A rescaling of the dispersive component of TPS MMT cross-interactions was used to optimize the FF for the composite system, with structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties obtained from long AA simulations forming the constraints for optimization. The obtained CG FF parameters provided excellent estimates for several other properties of the melt and composite systems not used in parameter estimation, thus establishing the robustness of the developed model.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to incorporating intermolecular dispersion into the openCOSMO-RS model. Part 1: Halocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COSMO-RS (Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents) is a predictive thermodynamic model that has found diverse applications in various domains like chemical engineering, environmental chemistry, nanotechnology, material science, and biotechnology. Its core concept involves calculating the screening charge density on the surface of each molecule and letting these surface patches interact with each other to calculate thermodynamic properties. In this study, we aim to enhance the performance of the open-source implementation openCOSMO-RS by incorporating dispersive interactions between the paired segments. Several parametrizations were systematically evaluated through the extensive regression analysis using a comprehensive database of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE), Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium (LLE) and Infinite Dilution Activity Coefficients (IDACs). Furthermore, the influence of different combinatorial terms on the model performance was investigated. Our findings indicate that incorporating dispersive interactions significantly improves the accuracy of phase equilibrium predictions for halocarbons and refrigerant mixtures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an aggregation process that begins with equal concentrations of positively and negatively `charged' monomers. Oppositely charged monomers merge to form neutral dimers. These dimers are the seeds for subsequent aggregation events in which neutral clusters of necessarily even mass join irreversibly to form neutral aggregates of ever-increasing size. In the mean-field approximation with mass independent reaction rates, we solve for the reaction kinetics and show that the concentration of clusters of mass $k$, $c_k(t)$, asymptotically scales as $A_k/t$, with $A_k$ having a non-trivial dependence on $k$. We also investigate the phenomenon of gelation in charged aggregation when the reaction rate equals the product of the two incident cluster masses. Finally, we generalize our model to the case of three and more types of monomers.</description>

      <title>Pyroresistive response of percolating conductive polymer composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pyroresistive response of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) has attracted much interest because of its potential applications in many electronic devices requiring a significant responsiveness to changes in external physical parameters such as temperature or electric fields. Although extensive research has been conducted to study how the properties of the polymeric matrix and conductive fillers affect the positive temperature coefficient pyroresistive effect, the understanding of the microscopic mechanism governing such a phenomenon is still incomplete. In particular, to date, there is little body of theoretical research devoted to investigating the effect of the polymer thermal expansion on the electrical connectivity of the conductive phase. Here, we present the results of simulations of model CPCs in which rigid conductive fillers are dispersed in an insulating amorphous matrix. By employing a meshless algorithm to analyze the thermoelastic response of the system, we couple the computed strain field to the electrical connectedness of the percolating conductive particles. We show that the electrical conductivity responds to the local strains that are generated by the mismatch between the thermal expansion of the polymeric and conductive phases and that the conductor-insulator transition is caused by a sudden and global disconnection of the electrical contacts forming the percolating network.</description>

      <title>Deformation localisation in stretched liquid crystal elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05476v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model within the framework of finite elasticity two inherent instabilities observed in liquid crystal elastomers under uniaxial tension. First is necking which occurs when a material sample suddenly elongates more in a small region where it appears narrower than the rest of the sample. Second is shear striping, which forms when the in-plane director rotates gradually to realign and become parallel with the applied force. These phenomena are due to the liquid crystal molecules rotating freely under mechanical loading. To capture necking, we assume that the uniaxial order parameter increases with tensile stretch, as reported experimentally during polydomain-monodomain transition. To account for shear striping, we maintain the uniaxial order parameter fixed, as suggested by experiments. Our finite element simulations capture well these phenomena. As necking in liquid crystal elastomers has not been satisfactorily modelled before, our theoretical and numerical findings related to this effect can be of wide interest. Shear striping has been well studied, yet our computed examples also show how optimal stripe width increases with the nematic penetration depth measuring the competition between the Frank elasticity of liquid crystals and polymer elasticity. Although known theoretically, this result has not been confirmed numerically by previous nonlinear elastic models.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Dynamics of Particle Rearrangement and its Correlation with Stick-slip Behavior in Granular Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between the microscopic dynamics of particles and the macroscale response of granular materials has not been well established. To address this, we investigated the microscopic dynamics and fluctuations in the force network in a granular material subjected to plane shear. A two-dimensional discrete element model of a plane shear test was established, considering both sliding and rolling friction. We found that particle rearrangement originated from the reduction of inter-particle forces in an identifiable region, which we call the greatest reduction (GR) region, defined as a region containing inter-particle forces experiencing the greatest decrease in magnitude in a given time interval. Statistical analysis shows that not only the magnitude of the greatest non-affine deformation in the GR region but also dynamics of neighboring particles in the region are highly correlated with the macroscale shear stress drop. These trends were also observed for various sliding friction coefficients and for simulations containing many particles. However, the quantity and configuration of GR regions had minimal impact on macroscale stress drops. We expect that this study will shed new light on the relationship between microscopic dynamics and force network fluctuations in sheared granular media and contribute to developing a mesoscale elasto-plastic model for these materials.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of machine-learned "softness" in supercooled liquids describe dynamical heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of supercooled liquids slow down and become increasingly heterogeneous as they are cooled. Recently, local structural variables identified using machine learning, such as "softness", have emerged as predictors of local dynamics. Here we construct a model using softness to describe the structural origins of dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquids. In our model, the probability of particles to rearrange is determined by their softness, and each rearrangement induces changes in the softness of nearby particles, describing facilitation. We show how to ensure that these changes respect the underlying time-reversal symmetry of the liquid's dynamics. The model reproduces the salient features of dynamical heterogeneity, and demonstrates how long-ranged dynamical correlations can emerge at long time scales from a relatively short softness correlation length.</description>

      <title>How emulsified droplets induce the bursting of suspended films of liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emulsion droplets of silicone oil (PDMS) are widely used as antifoaming agents but, in the case of non-aqueous foams, the mechanisms responsible for the bursting of the films separating the bubbles remain unclear. We consider a ternary non-aqueous liquid mixture in which PDMS-rich microdroplets are formed by spontaneous emulsification. In order to quantitatively assess the effect of the emulsified microdroplets, we measure the lifetime of sub-micrometer-thick suspended films of these emulsions as well as the time variations of their thickness profiles. We observe that a droplet entering the film reduces its lifetime by inducing a local and fast thinning. In most cases, we ascribe it to the spreading of the drop at one of the film interface with air, which drags the underlying liquid and causes eventually the film to burst rapidly. We explain why, despite slower spreading, more viscous droplets cause films to burst more efficiently. More rarely, microdroplets may bridge the two interfaces of the film, resulting in an even more efficient bursting of the film that we explain.</description>

      <title>Tuning the water intrinsic permeability of PEGDA hydrogel membranes by adding free PEG chains of varying molar masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effect of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) molar mass on the intrinsic permeability and structural characteristics of poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate PEGDA/PEG composite hydrogel membranes. We observe that by varying the PEG content and molar mass, we can finely adjust the water intrinsic permeability over several orders of magnitude. Notably, we show the existence of a maximum water intrinsic permeability, already identified in a previous study to be located at the critical overlap concentration C^* of PEG chains, for the highest PEG molar mass studied. Furthermore, we note that the maximum intrinsic permeability follows a non-monotonic evolution with respect to the PEG molar mass and reaches its peak at 35 000 g.mol-1. Besides our results show that a significant fraction of PEG chains is irreversibly trapped within the PEGDA matrix even for the shortest molar masses down to 600 g.mol-1. This observation suggests the possibility of covalent grafting of PEG chains to the PEGDA matrix. CryoSEM and AFM measurements demonstrate the presence of large micron-sized cavities separated by PEGDA-rich walls whose nanometric structure strongly depends on the PEG content. By combining our permeability and structural measurements, we suggest that the PEG chains trapped inside the PEGDA rich walls induce nanoscale defects in the cross linking density, resulting in an increased permeability below C^*. Conversely, above C^*, we speculate that partially-trapped PEG chains may form a brush-like arrangement on the surface of the PEGDA-rich walls, leading to a reduction in permeability. These two opposing effects are anticipated to exhibit molar-mass-dependent trends, contributing to the non-monotonic variation of the maximum intrinsic permeability at C^*. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential to fine-tune the properties of hydrogel membranes, offering new opportunities in separation applications.</description>

      <title>Shear thickening in suspensions of particles with dynamic brush layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of frictional interactions among liquid-suspended particles has led to tunable, strikingly non-Newtonian rheology via the formation of strong flow constraints as particles come into close proximity under shear. Typically, these frictional interactions have been in the form of physical contact, controllable via particle shape and surface roughness. We investigate a different route, where molecular bridging between nearby particle surfaces generates a controllable "sticky" friction. This is achieved with surface-functionalized colloidal particles capable of forming dynamic covalent bonds with telechelic polymers that comprise the suspending fluid. At low shear stress this results in particles coated with a uniform polymer brush layer. Beyond an onset stress the telechelic polymers become capable of bridging and generate shear thickening. Over the size range investigated, we find that the dynamic brush layer leads to dependence of the onset stress on particle diameter that closely follows a power law with exponent -1.76. In the shear thickening regime, we observe an enhanced dilation in measurements of the first normal stress difference and reduction in the extrapolated volume fraction required for jamming, both consistent with an effective particle friction that increases with decreasing particle diameter. These results are discussed in light of predictions for suspensions of hard spheres and of polymer-grafted particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, simple scaling laws concerning the mechanical response and mechanical transition of Kirigami have been revealed through agreement between theory and experiment for kirigami made of paper [M. Isobe and K. Okumura, Sci. Rep. 2016]. Here, we provide experimental data obtained from kirigami made of soft elastic sheets to demonstrate good agreement with previous theories, although a number of assumptions in the theory are violated and the elastic modulus is three orders of magnitude smaller in the present case. This remarkable universality in the mechanics of Kirigami, which could be useful for applications, is reported with physical insights based on previous theories.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in cyanobacteria: from motion to structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many active systems are capable of forming intriguing patterns at scales significantly larger than the size of their individual constituents. We recently introduced a model for gliding filamentous cyanobacteria, which form a reticulate pattern as an early-stage biofilm. Our observations reveal that the filaments' bodies follow the track of the head, and are subject to curvature fluctuations, defining a new class of active matter: active spaghetti. By identifying the dominant aspects of the filament's dynamics, our model achieves great computational efficiency, without coarse-graining past the scale of an individual filament. Here, we explore large-scale collective effects and rich dynamics of cyanobacteria colonies, while still retaining information about the individual constituents' dynamics and their interactions. We characterize the system's topological transition from an isotropic distribution to a state of large-scale reticulate patterns by quantifying both dynamical and structural observables. Although it is not a periodic structure, in the steady state the reticulate pattern possesses a well-defined length scale determined by the filaments' Peclet number, which controls the relative importance of activity and curvature fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controllability of passive microparticles that are advected with the fluid flow generated by an actively controlled one is studied. The particles are assumed to be suspended in a viscous fluid and well separated so that the far-field Stokes flow solutions may be used to describe their interactions. Applying concepts from geometric control theory, explicit moves characterized by a small amplitude parameter $\varepsilon$ are devised to prove that the active particle can control one or two passive particles. The leading-order (in $\varepsilon$) theoretical predictions of the particle displacements are compared with those obtained numerically and it is found that the discrepancy is small even when $\varepsilon\approx 1$. These results demonstrate the potential for a single actuated particle to perform complex micromanipulations of passive particles in a suspension.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Hamonically trapped inertial run-and-tumble particle in one-dimension</title>

Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state of a one-dimensional inertial run-and-tumble particle (IRTP) trapped in a harmonic potential. We find that the presence of inertia leads to two distinct dynamical scenarios, namely, overdamped and underdamped, characterized by the relative strength of the viscous and the trap time-scales. We also find that inertial nature of the active dynamics leads to the particle being confined in specific regions of the phase plane in the overdamped and underdamped cases, which we compute analytically. Moreover, the interplay of the inertial and active time-scales gives rise to several sub-regimes, which are characterized by very different behaviour of position and velocity fluctuations of the IRTP. In particular, in the underdamped regime, both the position and velocity undergoes transitions from a novel multi-peaked structure in the strongly active limit to a single peaked Gaussian-like distribution in the passive limit. On the other hand, in the overdamped scenario, the position distribution shows a transition from a U-shape to a dome-shape, as activity is decreased. Interestingly, the velocity distribution in the overdamped scenario shows two transitions -- from a single-peaked shape with an algebraic divergence at the origin in the strongly active regime to a double peaked one in the moderately active regime to a dome-shaped one in the passive regime.</description>

      <title>Power-law correlation in the homogeneous disordered state of anisotropically self-propelled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles display unique collective phenomena, due to the intrinsic coupling of density and polarity. For instance, the giant number fluctuation appears in the orientationally ordered state, and the motility-induced phase separation appears in systems with repulsion. Effects of strong noise typically lead to a homogeneous disordered state, in which the coupling of density and polarity can still play a significant role. Here, we study universal properties of the homogeneous disordered state in two-dimensional systems with uniaxially anisotropic self-propulsion. Using hydrodynamic arguments, we propose that the density correlation and polarity correlation generically exhibit power-law decay with distinct exponents (-2 and -4, respectively) through the coupling of density and polarity. Simulations of self-propelled lattice gas models indeed show the predicted power-law correlations, regardless of whether the interaction type is repulsion or alignment. Further, by mapping the model to a two-component boson system and employing non-Hermitian perturbation theory, we obtain the analytical expression for the structure factors, the Fourier transform of the correlation functions. This reveals that even the first order of the interaction strength induces the power-law correlations.</description>

Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <title>Active particles in a tube: a generalized entropy potential approach</title>

Abstract: We study the transport of self-propelled noninteracting active Brownian particles (ABPs) and run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in long tubes of varying widths. Using a moment expansion, we construct a generalized Fick-Jacobs framework for the active particles when the tube width is large and slowly varying. We show that the variation of the particle density along the tube is well described by a one-dimensional generalized entropy potential. This potential resembles its passive counterpart, albeit with an effective temperature and an effective tube width that are renormalized by the activity. Our generalized entropy potential approach allows us to predict the steady-state density distribution along the tube as well as the mean escape time out of a spindle chamber. Finally, we show how to account for the emergence of spontaneous ratchet flows in asymmetric channel by including higher-order corrections neglected in the effective entropy potential approach.</description>

      <title>The impact of the interfacial Kapitza resistance on colloidal thermophoresis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal gradients impart thermophoretic forces on colloidal particles, pushing colloids towards cold or hot regions, a phenomenon called thermophoresis. Current theoretical approaches relate the Soret coefficient to local changes in the interfacial tension around the colloid, which lead to fluid flow around the colloid surface. The Kapitza resistance, a key variable in the description of interfacial heat transport, is an experimentally accessible property that modifies interfacial thermal fields. Here, we introduce a theoretical approach that describes colloid thermophoretic forces by incorporating explicitly Kapitza resistance effects. Our formulation can be used to monitor the dependence of thermophoresis on the interfacial thermal resistance. We show that the resistance modifies the thermal field around the colloids and identify experimental conditions where the Kapitza resistance influences the thermophoretic forces. We validate our theoretical approach by implementing a non-equilibrium molecular dynamics model of a colloid suspended in a solvent.</description>

      <title>Interpreting effective energy barriers to membrane permeation in terms of a heterogeneous energy landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major efforts in recent years have been directed towards understanding molecular transport in polymeric membranes, in particular reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes. Transition-state theory is an increasingly common approach to explore mechanisms of transmembrane permeation with molecular details, but most applications treat all free energy barriers to transport within the membrane as equal. This assumption neglects the inherent structural and chemical heterogeneity in polymeric membranes. In this work, we expand the transition-state theory framework to include distributions of membrane free energy barriers. We show that the highest free energy barriers along the most permeable paths, rather than typical paths, provide the largest contributions to the experimentally-observed effective free energy barrier. We show that even moderate, random heterogeneity in molecular barriers will significantly impact how we interpret the mechanisms of transport through membranes. Simplified interpretations of experimentally measured barriers can lead to incorrect assumptions about the underlying mechanisms governing transport and miss the mechanisms most relevant to the overall permeability.</description>

      <title>Success and failure of the spreading law for large drops of dense granular suspensions</title>

Abstract: The spreading of large viscous drops of density-matched suspensions of non-Brownian spheres on a smooth solid surface is experimentally investigated at the global drop scale. The focus is on dense suspensions with a solid volume fraction equal to or greater than $40\%$ and for drops larger than the capillary length, i.e. for which the spreading is governed by the balance of gravitational and viscous forces. Our findings indicate that all liquids exhibit a power law behaviour typical of gravity-driven dynamics, albeit with an effective suspension viscosity that is smaller than the bulk value. When the height of the drop is of the order of the particle size, the power law breaks down as the particles freeze while the contact line continues to advance.</description>

      <title>Pattern selection and the route to turbulence in incompressible polar active fluids</title>

Abstract: Active fluids, such as suspensions of microswimmers, are known to self-organize into complex spatio-temporal flow patterns. An intriguing example is mesoscale turbulence, a state of dynamic vortex structures exhibiting a characteristic length scale. Here, we employ a minimal model for the effective microswimmer velocity field to explore how the turbulent state develops from regular vortex patterns when the strength of activity resp. related parameters such as nonlinear advection or polar alignment strength - is increased. First, we demonstrate analytically that the system, without any spatial constraints, develops a stationary square vortex lattice in the absence of nonlinear advection. Subsequently, we perform an extended stability analysis of this nonuniform "ground state" and uncover a linear instability, which follows from the mutual excitement and simultaneous growth of multiple perturbative modes. This extended analysis is based on linearization around an approximation of the analytical vortex lattice solution and allows us to calculate critical activity parameters. Above these critical values, the vortex lattice develops into mesoscale turbulence in numerical simulations. Utilizing the numerical approach, we uncover an extended region of hysteresis where both patterns are possible depending on the initial condition. Here, we find that turbulence persists below the instability of the vortex lattice. We further determine the stability of square vortex patterns as a function of their wavenumber and represent the results analogous to the well-known Busse balloons known from classical pattern-forming systems. Here, the region of stable periodic patterns shrinks and eventually disappears with increasing activity parameters. Our results show that the strength of activity plays a similar role for active turbulence as the Reynolds number does in driven flow exhibiting inertial turbulence.</description>

      <title>Granular aqueous suspensions with controlled inter-particular friction and adhesion</title>

Abstract: We present a simple route to obtain large quantities of suspensions of non-Brownian particles with stimuli-responsive surface properties to study the relation between their flow and interparticle interactions. We perform an alkaline hydrolysis reaction on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles to obtain poly(sodium methacrylate) (PMAA-Na) particles. We characterize the quasi-static macroscopic frictional response of their aqueous suspensions using a rotating drum. The suspensions are frictionless when the particles are dispersed in pure water. We relate this state to the presence of electrosteric repulsion between the charged surfaces of the ionized PMAA-Na particles in water. Then we add monovalent and multivalent ions (Na+, Ca2+, La3+) and we observe that the suspensions become frictional whatever the valency. For divalent and trivalent ions, the quasi-static avalanche angle {\theta}c at large ionic strength is greater than that of frictional PMMA particles in water, suggesting the presence of adhesion. Finally, a decrease in the pH of the suspending solution leads to a transition between a frictionless plateau and a frictional one. We perform Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to relate our macroscopic observations to the surface features of the particles. In particular, we show that the increase in friction in the presence of multivalent ions or under acidic conditions is driven by a nanoscopic phase separation and the bundling of polyelectrolyte chains at the surface of the particle. Our results highlight the importance of surface interactions in the rheology of granular suspensions. Our particles provide a simple, yet flexible platform to study frictional suspension flows.</description>

Abstract: Recent works have shown that in contrast to classical linear elastic fracture mechanics, endowing crack fronts in a brittle Green-elastic solid with Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity yields a model that predicts bounded stresses and strains at the crack tips for plane-strain problems. However, singularities persist for anti-plane shear (mode-III fracture) under far-field loading, even when Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity is incorporated.
  This work is motivated by obtaining a model of brittle fracture capable of predicting bounded stresses and strains for all modes of loading. We formulate an exact general theory of a three-dimensional solid containing a boundary surface with strain-gradient surface elasticity. For planar reference surfaces parameterized by flat coordinates, the form of surface elasticity reduces to that introduced by Hilgers and Pipkin, and when the surface energy is independent of the surface covariant derivative of the stretching, the theory reduces to that of Steigmann and Ogden. We discuss material symmetry using Murdoch and Cohen's extension of Noll's theory. We present a model small-strain surface energy that incorporates resistance to geodesic distortion, satisfies strong ellipticity, and requires the same material constants found in the Steigmann-Ogden theory.
  Finally, we derive and apply the linearized theory to mode-III fracture in an infinite plate under far-field loading. We prove that there always exists a unique classical solution to the governing integro-differential equation, and in contrast to using Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity, our model is consistent with the linearization assumption in predicting finite stresses and strains at the crack tips.</description>

      <title>A method to measure the embedded crack length and position in high-density polyethylene using microseconds ultrasound time signal</title>

Abstract: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is used in applications ranging from cooling water pipelines in nuclear power plants and distribution pipelines for natural gas and hydrogen to biomedical implants. Embedded crack-like flaws form within HDPE during fabrication or operations. Non-visible flaws can cause catastrophic failure if undetected. Large structures such as HDPE pipelines require a fast, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method where the sensor can move rapidly across the structure. This is only possible if the flaw is evaluated using microseconds of time signal. We propose and show the accuracy of a machine learning-based Ultrasound NDE method that can rapidly and accurately predict embedded crack length and position simultaneously in HDPE with only tens of microseconds of time signal sensing. A method to quantify crack size in HDPE and other polymers using a very short Ultrasound time signal is lacking. We propose that an optimally trained machine learning model can decipher the crack characteristics using short measures of time signal, but a lack of large, well-distributed, and labeled datasets to train machine learning models continues to be a major limitation. To overcome this limitation, we have conducted computer simulations of ultrasound on HDPE to develop training data. We show that fully simulations trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can accurately predict crack lengths and positions in HDPE from experimentally measured ultrasound A-scan microsecond signals. Our method is based on the 1D time amplitude signal acquired over a very short time period and not based on 2D image analysis. The proposed methodology presents a pathway for training CNN using computationally generated data and applying the trained CNN in the field to quantify hidden cracks in large HDPE or other polymer structures.</description>

Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>
