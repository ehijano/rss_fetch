      <title>The Finiteness Principle for the boundary values of $C^2$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a domain in $R^n$, and let $N=3\cdot 2^{n-1}$. We prove that the trace of the space $C^2(\Omega)$ to the boundary of $\Omega$ has the following finiteness property: A function $f:\partial\Omega\to R$ is the trace to the boundary of a function $F\in C^2(\Omega)$ provided there exists a constant $\lambda&gt;0$ such that for every set $E\subset\partial\Omega$ consisting of at most $N$ points there exists a function $F_E\in C^2(\Omega)$ with $\|F_E\|_{C^2(\Omega)}\le\lambda$ whose trace to $\partial\Omega$ coincides with $f$ on $E$. We also prove a refinement of this finiteness principle, which shows that in this criterion we can use only $N$-point subsets $E\subset\partial\Omega$ which have some additional geometric ``visibility'' properties with respect to the domain $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of Multiparameter Forelli-Rudin Type Operators on Product $L^p$ Spaces over Tubular Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two classes of multiparameter Forelli-Rudin type operators from $L^{\vec{p}}\left(T_B\times T_B, dV_{\alpha_1}\times dV_{\alpha_2}\right)$ to $L^{\vec{q}}\left(T_B\times T_B, dV_{\beta_1}\times dV_{\beta_2}\right)$, especially on their boundedness, where $L^{\vec{p}}\left(T_B\times T_B, dV_{\alpha_1}\times dV_{\alpha_2}\right)$ and $L^{\vec{q}}\left(T_B\times T_B, dV_{\beta_1}\times dV_{\beta_2}\right)$ are both weighted Lebesgue spaces over the Cartesian product of two tubular domains $T_B\times T_B$, with mixed-norm and appropriate weights. We completely characterize the boundedness of these two operators when $1\le \vec{p}\le \vec{q}&lt;\infty$. Moreover, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition of the case that $\vec{q}=(\infty,\infty)$. As an application, we obtain the boundedness of three common classes of integral operators, including the weighted multiparameter Bergman-type projection and the weighted multiparameter Berezin-type transform.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>On the Double Sequence Space $\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta}$ as an Extension of Hahn Space $h$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double sequence spaces have become a significant area of research within functional analysis due to their applications in various branches of mathematics and mathematical physics. In this study, we investigate Hahn double sequence space denoted as $\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta}$, where $\vartheta\in\{p,bp,r\}$, as an extension of the Hahn sequence space $h$. Our investigation begins with an analysis of several topological properties of $\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta}$, apart from a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between Hahn double sequences and some other classical double sequence spaces. The $\alpha-$dual, algebraic dual and $\beta(bp)-$dual, and $\gamma-$dual of the space $\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta}$ are detrmined. Furthermore, we define the determining set of $\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta}$ and we state the conditions concerning the characterization of four-dimensional (4D) matrix classes $(\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta},\lambda)$, where $\lambda=\{\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta},\mathcal{BV}, \mathcal{BV}_{\vartheta 0}, \mathcal{CS}_{\vartheta},\mathcal{CS}_{\vartheta 0},\mathcal{BS}\}$ and $(\mu,\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta})$, where $\mu=\{\mathcal{L}_u, \mathcal{C}_{\vartheta 0}, \mathcal{C}_{\vartheta},\mathcal{M}_{u}\}$. In conclusion, this research contributes non-standard investigation and various significant results into the space $\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta}$. The conducted results are deepen the understanding of the space $\mathcal{H}_{\vartheta}$ and open up new avenues for further research and applications in sequence space theory.</description>

      <title>Energy Propagation in Scattering Convolution Networks Can Be Arbitrarily Slow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze energy decay for deep convolutional neural networks employed as feature extractors, such as Mallat's wavelet scattering transform. For time-frequency scattering transforms based on Gabor filters, it has been established that energy decay is exponential, for arbitrary square-integrable input signals. Our main results allow to prove that this is wrong for wavelet scattering in arbitrary dimensions. In this setting, the energy decay of the scattering transform acting on a generic square-integrable signal turns out to be arbitrarily slow. The fact that this behavior holds for dense subsets of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ emphasizes that fast energy decay is generally not a stable property of signals.
  We complement these findings with positive results allowing to conclude fast (up to exponential) energy decay for generalized Sobolev spaces that are tailored to the frequency localization of the underlying filter bank.
  Both negative and positive results highlight that energy decay in scattering networks critically depends on the interplay of the respective frequency localizations of the signal on the one hand, and of the employed filters on the other.</description>

      <title>New results on biorthogonal families in cylindrical domains and controllability consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider moment problems equivalent to null controllability of some linear parabolic partial differential equations in space dimension higher than one. For these moment problems, we prove existence of an associated biorthogonal family and estimate its norm. The considered setting requires the space domain to be a cylinder and the evolution operator to be tensorized. Roughly speaking, we assume that the so-called Lebeau-Robbiano spectral inequality holds but only for the eigenvectors of the transverse operator. In the one dimensional tangent variable we assume the solvability of block moment problem as introduced in [Benabdallah, Boyer and Morancey - \textit{Ann. H. Lebesgue.} 3 (2020)]. We apply this abstract construction of biorthogonal families to the characterization of the minimal time for simultaneous null controllability of two heat-like equations in a cylindrical domain. To the best of our knowledge, this result is unattainable with other known techniques.</description>

      <title>On the Operators with Numerical Range in an Ellipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give new necessary and sufficient conditions for the numerical range $W(T)$ of an operator $T \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ to be a subset of the closed elliptical set $K_\delta \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ given by \[ K_\delta {\stackrel{\rm def}{=}}
  \left\{x+iy: \frac{x^2}{(1+\delta)^2} + \frac{y^2}{(1-\delta)^2} \leq 1\right\}, \] where $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. Here $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ denotes the collection of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Central to our efforts is a direct generalization of Berger's well-known criterion for an operator to have numerical radius at most one, his so-called strange dilation theorem.
  We next generalize the lemma of Sarason that describes power dilations in terms of semi-invariant subspaces to operators $T$ that satisfy appropriate dilation properties. This generalization yields a characterization of the operators $T\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ such that $W(T)$ is contained in $K_\delta$ in terms of certain structured contractions that act on $\mathcal{H} \oplus \mathcal{H}$.
  As a corollary of our results we extend Ando's parametrization of operators having numerical range in a disc to those $T$ such that $W(T)\subseteq K_\delta$. We prove that, if $T$ acts on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, then $W(T)\subseteq K_\delta$ if and only if there exist a pair of contractions $A,B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ such that $A$ is self-adjoint and \[ T=2\sqrt\delta A + (1-\delta)\sqrt{{1+A}}\ B\sqrt{{1-A}}. \] We also obtain a formula for the B. and F. Delyon calcular norm of an analytic function on the inside of an ellipse in terms of the extremal $H^\infty$-extension problem for analytic functions defined on a slice of the symmetrized bidisc.</description>

      <title>Envelopes in the class of Banach algebras of polynomial growth and $C^\infty$-functions of a finite number of free variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of envelope of a topological algebra (in particular, an arbitrary associative algebra) with respect to a class of Banach algebra. In the case of the class of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth, i.e., admitting a $C^\infty$-functional calculus for every element, we get a functor that maps the algebra of polynomials in $k$ variables to the algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on $\mathbb{R}^k$. The envelope of a general commutative or non-commutative algebra can be treated as an algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on some commutative or non-commutative space. In particular, we describe the envelopes of the universal enveloping algebra of finite-dimensional Lie algebras, the coordinate algebras of the quantum plane and quantum $SL(2)$ and also look at some commutative examples. A result on algebras of `free $C^\infty$-functions', i.e., the envelopes of free associative algebras of finite rank $k$, is announced for general $k$ and proved for $k\le 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Arens-Michael envelope of the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra is a homological epimorphism if and only if the Lie algebra is solvable. The necessity was proved by Pirkovskii in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 134, 2621--2631, 2006]. We prove the sufficiency.</description>

Abstract: We study a statistical model for infinite dimensional Gaussian random variables with unknown parameters. For this model we derive linear estimators for the mean and the variance of the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing. A linear regression problem in infinite dimensions and some perspectives to statistical and machine learning are presented as well.</description>

      <title>On sharp variational inequalities for oscillatory integral operators of Stein-Wainger type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any integer $n \geq 2$, we establish $L^p(\R^n)$ inequalities for the $r$-variations of Stein-Wainger type oscillatory integral operators with general radial phase functions. These inequalities closely related to Carleson's theorem are sharp, up to endpoints. In particular, when the phase function is chosen as $|t|^\A$ with $\A\in (0,1)$, our results provide an affirmative answer to a question posed in Guo-Roos-Yung (Anal. PDE, 2020). In pursuit of the objective, we use an approach incorporating the method of stationary phase, a square function estimate derived from Seeger's arguments, Stein-Tomas restriction estimates, and a crucial observation enabling the derivation of useful decay estimates near endpoints. Furthermore, we obtain the restricted weak type estimates for endpoints in the specific case of homogeneous phase functions. As an application of these outcomes, we further extend analogous results to a class of ergodic integral operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundedness and compactness properties of the generalized integration operator $T_{g,a}$ when it acts between distinct Hardy spaces in the unit disc of the complex plane. This operator has been introduced by the first author in connection to a theorem of Cohn about factorization of higher order derivatives of functions in Hardy spaces. We answer in the affirmative a conjecture stated in the same work, therefore giving a complete characterization of the class of symbols $g$ for which the operator is bounded from the Hardy space $H^p$ to $H^q, \, 0&lt;p,q&lt;\infty.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heisenberg modules over noncommutative tori may also be viewed as Gabor frames. Building on this fact, we relate to deformations of noncommutative tori a bundle of Banach spaces induced by Heisenberg modules. The construction of this bundle of Banach spaces rests on deformation results of Gabor frames with windows in Feichtinger's algebra due to Feichtinger and Kaiblinger. We extend some of these results to Heisenberg modules, e.g. we establish an analog of the results by Feichtinger-Kaiblinger and a Balian-Low theorem.</description>
