      <title>A Combinatorial Theory of Assembly Systems via Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a combinatorial framework for analyzing assembly systems using generating functions. We explore the theory through concrete examples, such as linear polymers, and develop recursive equations to characterize valid assemblies. The framework accommodates various levels of description, from atoms to complex molecular structures, and provides combinatorial interpretations for each generating function. This approach enables the study of equilibrium behavior and the computation of equilibrium probabilities in polymer ensembles.</description>

      <title>Cyclic $m$-DCI-groups and $m$-CI-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the earlier work of Li (European J. Combin. 1997) and Dobson (Discrete Math. 2008), in this paper we complete the classification of cyclic $m$-DCI-groups and $m$-CI-groups. For a positive integer $m$ such that $m \ge 3$, we show that the group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is an $m$-DCI-group if and only if $n$ is not divisible by $8$ nor by $p^2$ for any odd prime $p &lt; m$. Furthermore, if $m \ge 6$, then we show that $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is an $m$-CI-group if and only if either $n \in \{ 8, 9, 18 \}$, or $n \notin \{ 8, 9, 18 \}$ and $n$ is not divisible by $8$ nor by $p^2$ for any odd prime $p &lt; \frac{m - 1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Strong isometric path complexity of graphs: Asymptotic minors, restricted holes, and graph operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (strong) isometric path complexity is a recently introduced graph invariant that captures how arbitrary isometric paths (i.e. shortest paths) of a graph can be viewed as a union of few ``rooted" isometric paths (i.e. isometric paths with a common end-vertex). It is known that this parameter can be computed optimally in polynomial time. Seemingly unrelated graph classes studied in metric graph theory (e.g. hyperbolic graphs), geometric intersection graph theory (e.g. outerstring graphs), and structural graph theory (e.g. (theta, prism, pyramid)-free graphs) have been shown to have bounded strong isometric path complexity [Chakraborty et al., MFCS '23].
  We show that important graph classes studied in \emph{coarse graph theory} (as introduced by [Georgakopoulos &amp; Papasoglu '23]) have bounded strong isometric path complexity. We show that the strong isometric path complexity of $K_{2,t}$-asymptotic minor-free graphs is bounded. Let $U_t$ denote the graph obtained by adding a universal vertex to a path of $t-1$ edges. We show that the strong isometric path complexity of $U_t$-asymptotic minor-free graphs is bounded. This implies $K_4^-$-asymptotic minor-free graphs, i.e. graphs that are quasi-isometric to a cactus [Fujiwara &amp; Papasoglu '23] have bounded strong isometric path complexity. On the other hand, $K_4$-minor-free graphs have unbounded strong isometric path complexity.
  We show that graphs whose all induced cycles of length at least 4 have the same length (also known as monoholed graphs as defined by [Cook et al., JCTB '24]) form a subclass of $U_4$-asymptotic minor-free graphs. Hence, the strong isometric path complexity of monoholed graphs is bounded. We show that even-hole free graphs have unbounded strong isometric path complexity.
  We show that the strong isometric path complexity is preserved under the fixed power, line graph, and clique-sums operators.</description>

      <title>Graphs quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterise graphs that are quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded treewidth. Specifically, we prove that a graph is quasi-isometric to a graph with bounded treewidth if and only if it has a tree-decomposition where each bag consists of a bounded number of balls of bounded diameter. This result extends a characterisation by Berger and Seymour (2024) of graphs that are quasi-isometric to trees. Additionally, we characterise graphs that are quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded pathwidth. As an application of these results, we show that graphs with bounded rank-width, graphs with bounded tree independence number, and graphs with bounded sim-width are quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Inequalities and asymptotics for hook lengths in $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study hook lengths in $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions. More precisely, we establish hook length inequalities between $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions for hook lengths $2$ and $3$, by deriving asymptotic formulas for the total number of hooks of length $t$ in both partition classes, for $t = 1, 2, 3$. From these asymptotics, we show that the ratio of the total number of hooks of length $t$ in $\ell$-regular partitions to those in $\ell$-distinct partitions tends to a constant that depends on $\ell$ and $t$. We also provide hook length inequalities within $\ell$-regular partitions and within $\ell$-distinct partitions.</description>

      <title>Packing Dijoins in Weighted Chordal Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a digraph, a dicut is a cut where all the arcs cross in one direction. A dijoin is a subset of arcs that intersects every dicut. Edmonds and Giles conjectured that in a weighted digraph, the minimum weight of a dicut is equal to the maximum size of a packing of dijoins. This has been disproved. However, the unweighted version conjectured by Woodall remains open. We prove that the Edmonds-Giles conjecture is true if the underlying undirected graph is chordal. We also give a strongly polynomial time algorithm to construct such a packing.</description>

      <title>Semicomplete multipartite weakly distance-regular digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph is semicomplete multipartite if its underlying graph is a complete multipartite graph. As a special case of semicomplete multipartite digraphs, J{\o}rgensen et al. \cite{JG14} initiated the study of doubly regular team tournaments. As a natural extension, we introduce doubly regular team semicomplete multipartite digraphs and show that such digraphs fall into three types. Furthermore, we give a characterization of all semicomplete multipartite commutative weakly distance-regular digraphs.</description>

      <title>Blocking Ideals: a method for sieving linear extensions of a finite poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard notion of poset probability of a finite poset P involves calculating, for incomparable $\alpha$, $\beta$ in P, the number of linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$. The fraction of those linear extensions among all linear extensions of P is the probability that $alpha &lt; \beta$. The question of whether there is always a pair $\alpha, \beta$ such that this probability lies between 1/3 and 2/3, in any poset P (that is not a chain) is the famous "1/3-2/3-conjecture".
  A general way of counting linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$ is to count linear extensions of the poset obtained by adding the relation $(\alpha,\beta)$, and its transitive consequences.
  For chain-products, and more generally for partition posets, lattice-path methods can be used to count the number of those linear extensions.
  We present an alternative approach to find the pertinent linear extensions. It relies on finding the "blocking ideals" in $J(P)$, where $J(P)$ is the lattice of order ideals in P. This method works for all finite posets.
  We illustrate this method by using blocking ideals to find explicit formulas of poset probabilities in cell posets $P_{\lambda}$ of two-row partitions. Well-known formulae such as the hook-length formula for $f^\lambda$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a partition $\lambda$, and the corresponding determinental formula by Jacobi-Trudi-Aitken for $f^{\lambda / \mu}$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a skew partition $\lambda / \mu$, are used along the way.
  We also calculate the limit probabilities when the elements $\alpha,\beta$ are fixed cells, but the arm-lengths tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Exponents in the local properties problem for difference sets have a gap at 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local properties problem for difference sets: If we have a large set of real numbers and know that every small subset has many distinct differences, to what extent must the entire set have many distinct differences? More precisely, we define $g(n, k, \ell)$ to be the minimum number of differences in an $n$-element set with the `local property' that every $k$-element subset has at least $\ell$ differences; we study the asymptotic behavior of $g(n, k, \ell)$ as $k$ and $\ell$ are fixed and $n \to \infty$.
  The quadratic threshold is the smallest $\ell$ (as a function of $k$) for which $g(n, k, \ell) = \Omega(n^2)$; its value is known when $k$ is even. In this paper, we show that for $k$ even, when $\ell$ is one below the quadratic threshold, we have $g(n, k, \ell) = O(n^c)$ for an absolute constant $c &lt; 2$ -- i.e., at the quadratic threshold, the `exponent of $n$ in $g(n, k, \ell)$' jumps by a constant independent of $k$.</description>

      <title>Covering half-grids with lines and planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hyperplane covering problems for finite grid-like structures in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We call a set $\mathcal{C}$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ a conical grid if the line $y = a_i$ intersects $\mathcal{C}$ in exactly $i$ points, for some $a_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; a_n \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the number of lines required to cover every point of such a grid at least $k$ times is at least $nk\left(1-\frac{1}{e}-O(\frac{1}{n}) \right)$. If the grid $\mathcal{C}$ is obtained by cutting an $m \times n$ grid of points into a half along one of the diagonals, then we prove the lower bound of $mk\left(1-e^{-\frac{n}{m}}-O(\frac{n}{m^2})\right)$.
  Motivated by the Alon-F\"uredi theorem on hyperplane coverings of grids that miss a point and its multiplicity variations, we study the problem of finding the minimum number of hyperplanes required to cover every point of an $n \times \cdots \times n$ half-grid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at least $k$ times while missing a point $P$. For almost all such half-grids, with $P$ being the corner point, we prove asymptotically sharp upper and lower bounds for the covering number in dimensions $2$ and $3$. For $k = 1$, $d = 2$, and an arbitrary $P$, we determine this number exactly by using the polynomial method bound for grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a cap in the affine geometry AG(n,2) to be a subset in which every collection of four points is in general position. In this paper, we classify, up to affine equivalence, all caps in AG(7,2) of size k greater than or equal to 10. In particular, we show that there are two equivalence classes of 10-caps and one equivalence class of 11-caps, none of which are complete, and one equivalence class of 12-caps, which are both complete and of maximum size.</description>

      <title>On generalizing cryptographic results to Sidon sets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Sidon set $S$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a set such that $x+y=z+w$ has no solutions $x,y,z,w \in S$ with $x,y,z,w$ all distinct. In this paper, we prove various results on Sidon sets by using or generalizing known cryptographic results. In particular, we generalize known results on the Walsh transform of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions to Sidon sets. One such result is that we classify Sidon sets with minimal linearity as those that are $k$-covers. That is, Sidon sets with minimal linearity are those Sidon sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ such that there exists $k &gt; 0$ such that for any $p \in \mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus S$, there are exactly $k$ subsets $\{x,y,z\} \subseteq S$ such that $x+y+z = p$. From this, we also classify $k$-covers by means of the Cayley graph of a particular Boolean function, and we construct the unique rank $3$ strongly regular graph with parameters $(2048, 276, 44, 36)$ as the Cayley graph of a Boolean function. Finally, by computing the linearity of a particular family of Sidon sets, we increase the best-known lower bound of the largest Sidon set in $\mathbb{F}_2^{4t+1}$ by $1$ for all $t \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Partial Duals of Hypermaps by Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of partial duality in hypermaps was introduced by Chmutov and Vignes-Tourneret, and Smith independently. This notion serves as a generalization of the concept of partial duality found in maps. In this paper, we first present an Euler-genus formula concerning the partial duality of hypermaps, which serves as an invariant related to the result obtained by Chmutov and Vignes-Tourneret. This formulation also generalizes the result of Gross, Mansour, and Tucker regarding partial duality in maps. Subsequently, we enumerate the distribution of partial dual Euler-genus for hypermaps and compute the corresponding polynomial for specific classes of hypermaps through three operations: join, bar-amalgamation, and subdivision.</description>

      <title>Acyclic Edge Coloring of 3-sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper edge coloring of a graph without any bichromatic cycles is said to be an acyclic edge coloring of the graph. The acyclic chromatic index of a graph $G$ denoted by $a'(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has an acyclic edge coloring with $k$ colors. Fiam\v{c}\'{\i}k conjectured that for a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, $a'(G) \le \Delta+2$. A graph $G$ is said to be $3$-sparse if every edge in $G$ is incident on at least one vertex of degree at most $3$. We prove the conjecture for the class of $3$-sparse graphs. Further, we give a stronger bound of $\Delta +1$, if there exists an edge $xy$ in the graph with $d_G(x)+ d_G(y) &lt; \Delta+3$. When $ \Delta &gt; 3$, the $3$-sparse graphs where no such edge exists is the set of bipartite graphs where one partition has vertices with degree exactly $3$ and the other partition has vertices with degree exactly $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Filtrations of Tope Spaces of Oriented Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare three filtrations of the tope space of an oriented matroid. The first is the dual Varchenko-Gelfand degree filtration, the second filtration is from Kalinin's spectral sequence, and the last one derives from Quillen's augmentation filtration. We show that all three filtrations and the respective maps coincide over $\mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z}$.
  We also show that the dual Varchenko-Gelfand degree filtration can be made into a filtration of the $\mathbb{Z}$-sign cosheaf on the fan of the underlying matroid. This was previously carried out with $\mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients by the first author and Renaudineau using the Quillen filtration and has applications to real algebraic geometry via patchworking.</description>

      <title>On partition and almost disjoint properties of combinatorial notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there are many notions of largeness in a semigroup that own rich combinatorial properties. In this paper, we focus on partition and almost disjoint properties of these notions. One of the most remarkable results with respect to this topic is that in an infinite very weakly cancellative semigroup of size \kappa, every central set can be split into \kappa disjoint central subsets. Moreover, if \kappa contains \lambda almost disjoint subsets, then every central set contains a family of \lambda almost disjoint central subsets. And many other combinatorial notions are found successively to have analogous properties, among these are thick sets, piecewise syndetic sets, J-sets and C-sets. In this paper, we mainly study four other notions: IP sets, combinatorially rich sets, Cp-sets and PP-rich sets. Where the latter two are known in (N, +), related to the polynomial extension of the central sets theorem. We lift them up to commutative cancellative semigroups and obtain an uncountable version of the polynomial extension of the central sets theorem incidentally. And we finally find that the infinite partition and almost disjoint properties hold for Cp-sets in commutative cancellative semigroups and for other three notions in (N, +).</description>

      <title>A study on $T$-equivalent graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his article [J. Comb. Theory Ser. B 16 (1974), 168-174], Tutte called two graphs $T$-equivalent (i.e., codichromatic) if they have the same Tutte polynomial and showed that graphs $G$ and $G'$ are $T$-equivalent if $G'$ is obtained from $G$ by flipping a rotor (i.e., replacing it by its mirror) of order at most $5$, where a rotor of order $k$ in $G$ is an induced subgraph $R$ having an automorphism $\psi$ with a vertex orbit $\{\psi^i(u): i\ge 0\}$ of size $k$ such that every vertex of $R$ is only adjacent to vertices in $R$ unless it is in this vertex orbit. In this article, we first show the above result due to Tutte can be extended to a rotor $R$ of order $k\ge 6$ if the subgraph of $G$ induced by all those edges of $G$ which are not in $R$ satisfies certain conditions. Also, we provide a new method for generating infinitely many non-isomorphic $T$-equivalent pairs of graphs.</description>

      <title>Conjecture on Supersequence Lower Bound related to Connell Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves the minimum size of a supersequence over a set of eight elements is 52. This disproves a conjecture that the lower bound of the supersequence is the partial sum of the geometric Connell sequence. By studying the internal distribution of individual elements within sub-strings of the supersequence called segments, the proof provides important results on the internal structure that could help to understand the general lower bound problem for finite sets.</description>

      <title>More on the corner-vector construction for spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a full generalization of the classical corner-vector method for constructing weighted spherical designs, which we call the {\it generalized corner-vector method}. First we establish a uniform upper bound for the degree of designs obtained from the proposed method. Our proof is a hybrid argument that employs techniques in analysis and combinatorics, especially a famous result by Xu(1998) on the interrelation between spherical designs and simplical designs, and the cross-ratio comparison method for Hilbert identities introduced by Nozaki and Sawa(2013). We extensively study conditions for the existence of designs obtained from our method, and present many curious examples of degree $7$ through $13$, some of which are, to our surprise, characterized in terms of integral lattices.</description>

      <title>Tiling $H$ in dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine asymptotically the two extremal constructions for the tiling problem of the $H$-shaped tree. In particular, the first extremal construction is close to the complement of two cliques, in contrast to previously studied bipartite graphs, where the first extremal construction is close to the complement of a single clique. This result refutes one of Lang's conjectures [arXiv:2308.12281], which seeks to generalize the Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Codes with symmetric distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a code $C$ in a space with maximal distance $n$, we say that $C$ has symmetric distances if its distance set $S(C)$ is symmetric with respect to $n / 2$. In this paper, we prove that if $C$ is a binary code with length $2n$, constant weight $n$ and symmetric distances, then \[
  |C| \leq \binom{2 n - 1}{|S(C)|}. \] This result can be interpreted using the language of Johnson association schemes. More generally, we give a framework to study codes with symmetric distances in Q-bipartite Q-polynomial association schemes, and provide upper bounds for such codes. Moreover, we use number theoretic techniques to determine when the equality holds.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce the simplicial $d$-polytopic numbers defined on generalized Fibonacci polynomials. We establish basic identities and find $q$-identities known. Furthermore, we find generating functions for the simplicial $d$-polytopic numbers and for the squares of the generalized triangular numbers.

      <description>arXiv:2501.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is non-trivial if it contains at least one nonloop edge. The essential connectivity of $G$, denoted by $\kappa'(G)$, is the minimum number of vertices of $G$ whose removal produces a disconnected graph with at least two components are non-trivial. In this paper, we determine the $n$-vertex graph of given essential connectivity with minimum distance spectral radius. We also characterize the extremal graphs attaining the minimum distance spectral radius among all connected graphs with fixed essential connectivity and minimum degree. Furthermore, we characterize the extremal digraphs with minimum distance spectral radius among the strongly connected digraphs with given essential connectivity.</description>

      <title>Excluding a rectangular grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every positive integer $k$, we define the $k$-treedepth as the largest graph parameter $\mathrm{td}_k$ satisfying (i) $\mathrm{td}_k(\emptyset)=0$; (ii) $\mathrm{td}_k(G) \leq 1+ \mathrm{td}_k(G-u)$ for every graph $G$ and every vertex $u \in V(G)$; and (iii) if $G$ is a $(&lt;k)$-clique-sum of $G_1$ and $G_2$, then $\mathrm{td}_k(G) \leq \max \{\mathrm{td}_k(G_1),\mathrm{td}_k(G_2)\}$, for all graphs $G_1,G_2$. This parameter coincides with treedepth if $k=1$, and with treewidth plus $1$ if $k \geq |V(G)|$. We prove that for every positive integer $k$, a class of graphs $\mathcal{C}$ has bounded $k$-treedepth if and only if there is a positive integer $\ell$ such that for every tree $T$ on $k$ vertices, no graph in $\mathcal{C}$ contains $T \square P_\ell$ as a minor. This implies for $k=1$ that a minor-closed class of graphs has bounded treedepth if and only if it excludes a path, for $k=2$ that a minor-closed class of graphs has bounded $2$-treedepth if and only if it excludes as a minor a ladder (Huynh, Joret, Micek, Seweryn, and Wollan; Combinatorica, 2021), and for large values of $k$ that a minor-closed class of graphs has bounded treewidth if and only if it excludes a grid (Grid-Minor Theorem, Robertson and Seymour; JCTB, 1986). As a corollary, we obtain the following qualitative strengthening of the Grid-Minor Theorem in the case of bounded-height grids. For all positive integers $k, \ell$, every graph that does not contain the $k \times \ell$ grid as a minor has $(2k-1)$-treedepth at most a function of $(k, \ell)$.</description>

      <title>Forcing Quasirandomness in a Regular Tournament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tournament $H$ is said to \emph{force quasirandomness} if it has the property that a sequence $(T_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of tournaments of increasing orders is quasirandom if and only if the homomorphism density of $H$ in $T_n$ tends to $(1/2)^{\binom{v(H)}{2}}$ as $n\to\infty$. It was recently shown that there is only one non-transitive tournament with this property. This is in contrast to the analogous problem for graphs, where there are numerous graphs that are known to force quasirandomness and the well known Forcing Conjecture suggests that there are many more. To obtain a richer family of characterizations of quasirandomness in tournaments, we propose a variant in which the tournaments $(T_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ are assumed to be ``nearly regular.'' We characterize the tournaments on at most 5 vertices which force quasirandomness under this stronger assumption, with the exception of two tournaments for which we are unable to resolve the problem.</description>

      <title>Antidirected trees in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koml\'os-S\'ark\"ozy-Szemer\'edi (KSS) theorem establishes that a certain bound on the minimum degree of a graph guarantees it contains all bounded degree trees of the same order. Recently several authors put forward variants of this result, where the tree is of smaller order than the host graph, and the host graph also obeys a maximum degree condition. Also, Kathapurkar and Montgomery extended the KSS theorem to digraphs. We bring these two directions together by establishing minimum and maximum degree bounds for digraphs that ensure the containment of oriented trees of smaller order. Our result is restricted to balanced antidirected trees of bounded degree.
  More precisely, we show that for every $\gamma&gt;0$, $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $\ell\geq 2$, sufficiently large $n$ and all ${k\ge \gamma n}$, the following holds for every $n$-vertex digraph $D$ and every balanced antidirected tree $T$ with $k$ arcs whose total maximum degree is bounded by $(\log n)^c$. If $D$ has a vertex of outdegree at least ${(1+\gamma)(\ell-1)k}$, a vertex of indegree at least $(1+\gamma)(\ell-1)k$ and minimum semidegree $\delta^0(D)\geq (\frac{\ell}{2\ell-1}+\gamma)k$, then $D$ contains $T$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\eta_{g}(n) $ be the smallest cardinality that $A\subseteq {\mathbb Z}$ can have if $A$ is a $g$-difference basis for $[n]$ (i.e, if, for each $x\in [n]$, there are {\em at least} $g$ solutions to $a_{1}-a_{2}=x$ ). We prove that the finite, non-zero limit $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\eta_{g}(n)}{\sqrt{n}}$ exists, answering a question of Kravitz. We also investigate a similar problem in the setting of a vector space over a finite field.
  Let $\alpha_g(n)$ be the largest cardinality that $A\subseteq [n]$ can have if, for all nonzero $x$, $a_{1}-a_{2}=x$ has {\em at most} $g$ solutions. We also prove that $\alpha_g(n)={\sqrt{gn}}(1+o_{g}(1))$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>Permutation polynomials, projective polynomials, and bijections between $\mu_{\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}}$ and $PG(n-1,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a class of bijections between the projective geometry $PG(n-1,q)$ and the set of roots of unity $\mu_{\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}}$ in finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ for an arbitrary integer $n\geq 2$ and any basis of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. This generalizes the well-studied M\"obius transformations for $n=2$ and a recent result by Qu and Li for $n=3$ [39]. We also introduce a class of projective polynomials, using the coefficients and properties of which we determine the inverses of these bijections. Moreover, we study the roots of these projective polynomials and explicitly describe the correspondence between a partition of $\mu_{\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}}$ and a natural partition of $PG(n-1,q)$. As an application, we can generalize many previously known constructions of permutation polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ and thus obtain new classes of permutation polynomials of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ with index $\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$.</description>

      <title>Patterns in rectangulations. Part I: $\top$-like patterns, inversion sequence classes $I(010, 101, 120, 201)$ and $I(011, 201)$, and rushed Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of pattern avoidance in rectangulations. We give a formal definition of such patterns and investigate rectangulations that avoid $\top$-like patterns - the pattern $\top$ and its rotations. For every $L \subseteq \{\top, \, \vdash, \, \bot, \, \dashv \}$ we enumerate $L$-avoiding rectangulations, both weak and strong. In particular, we show $\top$-avoiding weak rectangulations are enumerated by Catalan numbers and construct bijections to several Catalan structures. Then, we prove that $\top$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with several classes of inversion sequences, among them $I(010,101,120,201)$ and $I(011,210)$ - which leads to a solution of the conjecture that these classes are Wilf-equivalent. Finally, we show that $\{\top, \bot\}$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with recently introduced rushed Dyck paths.</description>

      <title>Extended circular nim</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular nim $CN(m, k)$ is a variant of nim, in which there are $m$ piles of tokens arranged in a circle and each player, in their turn, chooses at most $k$ consecutive piles in the circle and removes an arbitrary number of tokens from each pile. The player must remove at least one token in total. For some cases of $m$ and $k$, closed formulas to determine which player has a winning strategy have been found. Almost all cases are still open problems. In this paper, we consider a variant of circular nim, extended circular nim. In extended circular nim $ECN(m_S, k)$, there are $m$ piles of tokes arranged in a circle. $S$ is a set of positive integers less than or equal to half of $m$. Each player, in their turn, chooses at most $k$ piles selected every $s$-th pile in a circle for an $s \in S$. We find some closed formulas to determine which player has a winning strategy for the cases where the number of piles is no more than eight.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on bi-$\gamma$-positivity of $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials $A^{(k)}_{n}(x)$ were introduced as ascent polynomials over $k$-inversion sequences by Savage and Viswanathan. The bi-$\gamma$-positivity of the $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials $A^{(k)}_{n}(x)$ was known but to give a combinatorial interpretation of the corresponding bi-$\gamma$-coefficients still remains open. The study of the theme of bi-$\gamma$-positivities from purely combinatorial aspect was proposed by Athanasiadis. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial interpretation for the bi-$\gamma$-coefficients of $A^{(k)}_{n}(x)$ by using the model of certain ordered labeled forests. Our combinatorial approach consists of three main steps:
  (i) construct a bijection between $k$-Stirling permutations and certain forests that are named increasing pruned even $k$-ary forests;
  (ii) introduce a generalized Foata--Strehl action on increasing pruned even $k$-ary trees which implies the longest ascent-plateau polynomials over $k$-Stirling permutations with initial letter $1$ are $\gamma$-positive, a result that may have independent interest;
  (iii) develop two crucial transformations on increasing pruned even $k$-ary forests to conclude our combinatorial interpretation.</description>

      <title>Further results on $r$-Euler-Mahonian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As natural generalizations of the descent number ($\des$) and the major index ($\maj$), Rawlings introduced the notions of the $r$-descent number ($r\des$) and the $r$-major index ($r\maj$) for a given positive integer $r$. A pair $(\st_1, \st_2)$ of permutation statistics is said to be $r$-Euler-Mahonian if $ (\mathrm{st_1}, \mathrm{st_2})$ and
  $ (r\des, r\maj)$ are equidistributed over the set $\mathfrak{S}_{n}$ of all permutations of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$. The main objective of this paper is to confirm a recent conjecture posed by Liu which asserts that $(g\exc_\ell, g\den_\ell)$ is $(g+\ell-1)$-Euler-Mahonian for all positive integers $g$ and $\ell$, where $g\exc_\ell$ denotes the $g$-gap $\ell$-level excedance number and $g\den_\ell$ denotes the $g$-gap $\ell$-level Denert's statistic. This is accomplished via a bijective proof of the equidistribution of $(g\exc_\ell, g\den_\ell)$ and $ (r\des, r\maj)$ where $r=g+\ell-1$.
  Setting $g=\ell=1$, our result recovers the equidistribution of $(\des, \maj)$ and $(\exc, \den)$, which was first conjectured by Denert and proved by Foata and Zeilberger. Our second main result is concerned with the analogous result for $(g\exc_\ell, g\den_{g+\ell})$ which states that $(g\exc_\ell, g\den_{g+\ell})$ is $(g+\ell-1)$-Euler-Mahonian for all positive integers $g$ and $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximally embedding dimension (MED) numerical semigroups are a wide and interesting family, with some remarkable algebraic and combinatorial properties. Associated to any numerical semigroup one can construct a MED closure, as it is well known. This paper shows two different explicit methods to construct this closure which also sheds new light on the very nature of this object.</description>

Abstract: For a given pair of numbers $(d,k)$, we establish a lower bound on the number of vertices in pure $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes with non-trivial homology in dimension $k$, and prove that this bound is tight. Furthermore, we solve the problem under the additional constraint of strong connectivity with respect to any intermediate dimension.</description>

      <title>The random graph process is globally synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homogeneous Kuramoto model on a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a network of $|V|$ identical oscillators, one at each vertex, where every oscillator is coupled bidirectionally (with unit strength) to its neighbors in the graph. A graph $G$ is said to be globally synchronizing if, for almost every initial condition, the homogeneous Kuramoto model converges to the all-in-phase synchronous state. Confirming a conjecture of Abdalla, Bandeira, Kassabov, Souza, Strogatz, and Townsend, we show that with high probability, the random graph process becomes globally synchronizing as soon as it is connected. This is best possible, since connectivity is a necessary condition for global synchronization.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Bailey pairs and Rogers-Ramanujan type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rogers-Ramanujan type identities occur in various branches of mathematics and physics. As a classic and powerful tool to deal with Rogers-Ramanujan type identities, the theory of Bailey's lemma has been extensively studied and generalized. In this paper, we found a bilateral Bailey pair that naturally arises from the q-binomial theorem. By applying the bilateral versions of Bailey lemmas, Bailey chains and Bailey lattices, we derive a number of Rogers-Ramanujan type identities, which unify many known identities as special cases. Further combined with the bilateral Bailey chains due to Berkovich, McCoy and Schilling and the bilateral Bailey lattices due to Jouhet et al., we also obtain identities on Appell-Lerch series and identities of Andrews-Gordon type. Moreover, by applying Andrews and Warnaar's bilateral Bailey lemmas, we derive identities on Hecke-type series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal is to provide simple and practical algorithms in higher-order Fourier analysis which are based on spectral decompositions of operators. We propose a general framework for such algorithms and provide a detailed analysis of the quadratic case. Our results reveal new spectral aspects of the theory underlying higher-order Fourier analysis. Along these lines, we prove new inverse and regularity theorems for the Gowers norms based on higher-order character decompositions. Using these results, we prove a spectral inverse theorem and a spectral regularity theorem in quadratic Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>On finite groups whose order supergraphs satisfy a connectivity condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be an undirected and simple graph. A set $ S $ of vertices in $\Gamma$ is called a {cyclic vertex cutset} of $\Gamma$ if $\Gamma - S$ is disconnected and has at least two components containing cycles. If $\Gamma$ has a cyclic vertex cutset, then it is said to be {cyclically separable}. The {cyclic vertex connectivity} of $\Gamma$ is the minimum of cardinalities of the cyclic vertex cutsets of $\Gamma$. For any finite group $G$, the order supergraph $\mathcal{S}(G)$ is the simple and undirected graph whose vertices are elements of $G$, and two vertices are adjacent if the order of one divides that of the other. In this paper, we characterize the finite nilpotent groups and various non-nilpotent groups whose order super graphs are cyclically separable.</description>

      <title>Colouring random Hasse diagrams and box-Delaunay graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $d\ge2$ and consider a uniformly random set $P$ of $n$ points in $[0,1]^{d}$. Let $G$ be the Hasse diagram of $P$ (with respect to the coordinatewise partial order), or alternatively let $G$ be the Delaunay graph of $P$ with respect to axis-parallel boxes (where we put an edge between $u,v\in P$ whenever there is an axis-parallel box containing $u,v$ and no other points of $P$).
  In each of these two closely related settings, we show that the chromatic number of $G$ is typically $(\log n)^{d-1+o(1)}$ and the independence number of $G$ is typically $n/(\log n)^{d-1+o(1)}$. When $d=2$, we obtain bounds that are sharp up to constant factors: the chromatic number is typically of order $\log n/\log\log n$ and the independence number is typically of order $n\log\log n/\log n$.
  These results extend and sharpen previous bounds by Chen, Pach, Szegedy and Tardos. In addition, they provide new bounds on the largest possible chromatic number (and lowest possible independence number) of a $d$-dimensional box-Delaunay graph or Hasse diagram, in particular resolving a conjecture of Tomon.</description>

      <title>On lattice illumination of smooth convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The illumination conjecture is a classical open problem in convex and discrete geometry, asserting that every compact convex body~$K$ in $\mathbb R^n$ can be illuminated by a set of no more than $2^n$ points. If $K$ has smooth boundary, it is known that $n+1$ points are necessary and sufficient. We consider an effective variant of the illumination problem for bodies with smooth boundary, where the illuminating set is restricted to points of a lattice and prove the existence of such a set close to $K$ with an explicit bound on the maximal distance. We produce improved bounds on this distance for certain classes of lattices, exhibiting additional symmetry or near-orthogonality properties. Our approach is based on the geometry of numbers.</description>

      <title>Answering Related Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the meta-problem Sidestep$(\Pi, \mathsf{dist}, d)$ for a problem $\Pi$, a metric $\mathsf{dist}$ over its inputs, and a map $d: \mathbb N \to \mathbb R_+ \cup \{\infty\}$. A solution to Sidestep$(\Pi, \mathsf{dist}, d)$ on an input $I$ of $\Pi$ is a pair $(J, \Pi(J))$ such that $\mathsf{dist}(I,J) \leqslant d(|I|)$ and $\Pi(J)$ is a correct answer to $\Pi$ on input $J$. This formalizes the notion of answering a related question (or sidestepping the question), for which we give some practical and theoretical motivations, and compare it to the neighboring concepts of smoothed analysis, planted problems, and edition problems. Informally, we call hardness radius the ``largest'' $d$ such that Sidestep$(\Pi, \mathsf{dist}, d)$ is NP-hard. This framework calls for establishing the hardness radius of problems $\Pi$ of interest for the relevant distances $\mathsf{dist}$.
  We exemplify it with graph problems and two distances $\mathsf{dist}_\Delta$ and $\mathsf{dist}_e$ (the edge edit distance) such that $\mathsf{dist}_\Delta(G,H)$ (resp. $\mathsf{dist}_e(G,H)$) is the maximum degree (resp. number of edges) of the symmetric difference of $G$ and $H$ if these graphs are on the same vertex set, and $+\infty$ otherwise. We show that the decision problems Independent Set, Clique, Vertex Cover, Coloring, Clique Cover have hardness radius $n^{\frac{1}{2}-o(1)}$ for $\mathsf{dist}_\Delta$, and $n^{\frac{4}{3}-o(1)}$ for $\mathsf{dist}_e$, that Hamiltonian Cycle has hardness radius 0 for $\mathsf{dist}_\Delta$, and somewhere between $n^{\frac{1}{2}-o(1)}$ and $n/3$ for $\mathsf{dist}_e$, and that Dominating Set has hardness radius $n^{1-o(1)}$ for $\mathsf{dist}_e$. We leave several open questions.</description>

Abstract: The formalisation of mathematics is starting to become routine, but the value of this technology to the work of mathematicians remains to be shown. There are few examples of using proof assistants to verify brand-new work. This paper reports the formalisation of a major new result (arXiv:2303.09521) about Ramsey numbers that was announced in 2023. One unexpected finding was the heavy need for computer algebra techniques.</description>

      <title>On variants of Chowla's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a (possibly empty) subset of primes, and let $H = \{h_1, \ldots, h_d\}$ be a subset of $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$. We consider the limit
  \[
  \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{x} \sum_{n\leqslant x} \lambda_P(n+h_1)\ldots\lambda_P(n+h_d)
  \]
  where $\lambda_P$ denotes the completely multiplicative function taking the value $-1$ at primes $p$ in $P$ and $1$ at every other prime. When $P$ is a small set, we evaluate the limit exactly, in particular showing that it exists. For arbitrary non-empty $P$, we show that limit (assuming that it exists) does not equal $\{\pm 1\}$, extending a result of Matom\"aki and Radziwi\l\l. We also determine the corresponding ``spectrum''.</description>

      <title>Random Subwords and Billiard Walks in Affine Weyl Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be an irreducible affine Weyl group, and let $\mathsf{b}$ be a finite word over the alphabet of simple reflections of $W$. Fix a probability $p\in(0,1)$. For each integer $K\geq 0$, let $\mathsf{sub}_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ be the random subword of $\mathsf{b}^K$ obtained by deleting each letter independently with probability $1-p$. Let $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ be the element of $W$ represented by $\mathsf{sub}_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$. One can view $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ geometrically as a random alcove; in many cases, this alcove can be seen as the location after a certain amount of time of a random billiard trajectory that, upon hitting a hyperplane in the Coxeter arrangement of $W$, reflects off of the hyperplane with probability $1-p$. We show that the asymptotic distribution of $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$ is a central spherical multivariate normal distribution with some variance $\sigma_{\mathsf{b}}^2$ depending on $\mathsf{b}$ and $p$. We provide a formula to compute $\sigma_{\mathsf{b}}^2$ that is remarkably simple when $\mathsf{b}$ contains only one occurrence of the simple reflection that is not in the associated finite Weyl group. As a corollary, we provide an asymptotic formula for $\mathbb{E}[\ell(v_p(\mathsf{b}^K))]$, the expected Coxeter length of $v_p(\mathsf{b}^K)$. For example, when $W=\widetilde A_{r}$ and $\mathsf{b}$ contains each simple reflection exactly once, we find that \[\lim_{K\to\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\mathbb{E}[\ell(v_p(\mathsf{b}^K))]=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}r(r+1)\frac{p}{1-p}}.\]</description>

      <title>Non-crossing $H$-graphs: a generalization of proper interval graphs admitting FPT algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new parameterized complexity results for the FO Model Checking problem and in particular for Independent Set, for two recently introduced subclasses of $H$-graphs, namely proper $H$-graphs and non-crossing $H$-graphs. It is known that proper $H$-graphs, and thus $H$-graphs, may have unbounded twin-width. However, we prove that for every connected multigraph $H$ with no self-loops, non-crossing $H$-graphs have bounded proper mixed-thinness, and thus bounded twin-width. Consequently, we can apply a well-known result of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e, and Watrigant (2021) to find that the FO Model Checking problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ for non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+\ell$, where $\Vert H \Vert$ is the size of $H$ and $\ell$ is the size of a formula. In particular, this implies that Independent Set is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ on non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$, where $k$ is the solution size. In contrast, Independent Set for general $H$-graphs is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert +k$. We strengthen the latter result by proving thatIndependent Set is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard even on proper $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$. In this way, we solve, subject to $\mathsf{W[1]}\neq \mathsf{FPT}$, an open problem of Chaplick (2023), who asked whether there exist problems that can be solved faster for non-crossing $H$-graphs than for proper $H$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Local Limits of Small World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-world networks, known for their high local clustering and short average path lengths, are a fundamental structure in many real-world systems, including social, biological, and technological networks. We apply the theory of local convergence (Benjamini-Schramm convergence) to derive the limiting behavior of the local structures for two of the most commonly studied small-world network models: the Watts-Strogatz model and the Kleinberg model. Establishing local convergence enables us to show that key network measures, such as PageRank, clustering coefficients, and maximum matching size, converge as network size increases with their limits determined by the graph's local structure. Additionally, this framework facilitates the estimation of global phenomena, such as information cascades, using local information from small neighborhoods. As an additional outcome of our results, we observe a critical change in the behavior of the limit exactly when the parameter governing long-range connections in the Kleinberg model crosses the threshold where decentralized search remains efficient, offering a new perspective on why decentralized algorithms fail in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Distinguished filtrations of the $0$-Hecke modules for dual immaculate quasisymmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ range over the set of compositions. Dual immaculate quasisymmetric functions $\mathfrak{S}_\alpha^*$, introduced by Berg, Bergeron, Saliola, Serrano, and Zabrocki, provide a quasisymmetric analogue of Schur functions. They also constructed an indecomposable $0$-Hecke module $\mathcal{V}_\alpha$ whose image under the quasisymmetric characteristic is $\mathfrak{S}_\alpha^*$. In this paper, we prove that $\mathcal{V}_\alpha$ admits a distinguished filtration with respect to the basis of Young quasisymmetric Schur functions. This result offers a novel representation-theoretic interpretation of the positive expansion of $\mathfrak{S}_\alpha^*$ in the basis of Young quasisymmetric Schur functions. A key tool in our proof is Mason's analogue of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm, for which we establish a version of Green's theorem. As an unexpected byproduct of our investigation, we construct an indecomposable $0$-Hecke module $\mathbf{Y}_\alpha$ whose image under the quasisymmetric characteristic is the Young quasisymmetric Schur function $\hat{\mathscr{S}}_\alpha$. Further properties of this module are also investigated. And, by applying a suitable automorphism twist to this module, we obtain an indecomposable $0$-Hecke module whose image under the quasisymmetric characteristic is the quasisymmetric Schur function $\mathscr{S}_\alpha$.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Computing a Fastest Temporal Path in Interval Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs arise when modeling interactions that evolve over time. They usually come in several flavors, depending on the number of parameters used to describe the temporal aspects of the interactions: time of appearance, duration, delay of transmission. In the point model, edges appear at specific points in time, while in the more general interval model, edges can be present over multiple time intervals. In both models, the delay for traversing an edge can change with each edge appearance. When time is discrete, the two models are equivalent in the sense that the presence of an edge during an interval is equivalent to a sequence of point-in-time occurrences of the edge. However, this transformation can drastically change the size of the input and has complexity issues. Indeed, we show a gap between the two models with respect to the complexity of the classical problem of computing a fastest temporal path from a source vertex to a target vertex, i.e. a path where edges can be traversed one after another in time and such that the total duration from source to target is minimized. It can be solved in near-linear time in the point model, while we show that the interval model requires quadratic time under classical assumptions of fine-grained complexity. With respect to linear time, our lower bound implies a factor of the number of vertices, while the best known algorithm has a factor of the number of underlying edges. Interestingly, we show that near-linear time is possible in the interval model when restricted to all delays being zero, i.e. traversing an edge is instantaneous.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Parking Process and Labeled IDLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new probabilistic variant of the classical parking protocol of Konheim and Weiss [29], which is closely related to Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation, or IDLA, introduced in 1991 by Diaconis and Fulton [15]. In particular, we show that if one runs our parking protocol starting with a parking function whose outcome permutation (in the sense of the classical parking process of Konheim and Weiss) is the identity permutation, then we can compute the exact probability that all of the cars park. Furthermore, we compute the expected time it takes for the protocol to complete assuming all of the cars park, and prove that the parking process is negatively correlated. We also study statistics of uniformly random weakly increasing parking functions, a subset of parking functions whose outcome is the identity permutation. We give the distribution of the last entry, along with the probability that a specific set of cars is lucky, and the expected number of lucky cars.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles supported by small chords and compatible with natural real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously proposed a study of arrangements of small circles which also surround regions in the plane realized as the images of natural real algebraic maps yielding Morse-Bott functions by projections. Among studies of arrangements, families of smooth regular submanifolds in smooth manifolds, this study is fundamental, explicit, and new, surprisingly.
  We have obtained a complete list of local changes of the graphs the regions naturally collapse to in adding a (generic) small circle to an existing arrangement of the proposed class. Here, we propose a similar and essentially different class of arrangements of circles. The present study also yields real algebraic maps and nice real algebraic functions similarly and we present a similar study.
  We are interested in topological properties and combinatorics among such arrangements and regions and applications to constructing such real algebraic maps and manifolds explicitly and understanding their global structures.</description>

      <title>Weight Distribution of the Weighted Coordinates Poset Block Space and Singleton Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the complete weight distribution of the space $ \mathbb{F}_q^N $ endowed by the weighted coordinates poset block metric ($(P,w,\pi)$-metric), also known as the $(P,w,\pi)$-space, thereby obtaining it for $(P,w)$-space, $(P,\pi)$-space, $\pi$-space, and $P$-space as special cases. Further, when $P$ is a chain, the resulting space is called as Niederreiter-Rosenbloom-Tsfasman (NRT) weighted block space and when $P$ is hierarchical, the resulting space is called as weighted coordinates hierarchical poset block space. The complete weight distribution of both the spaces are deduced from the main result. Moreover, we define an $I$-ball for an ideal $I$ in $P$ and study the characteristics of it in $(P,w,\pi)$-space.
  We investigate the relationship between the $I$-perfect codes and $t$-perfect codes in $(P,w,\pi)$-space. Given an ideal $I$, we investigate how the maximum distance separability (MDS) is related with $I$-perfect codes and $t$-perfect codes in $(P,w,\pi)$-space. Duality theorem is derived for an MDS $(P,w,\pi)$-code when all the blocks are of same length. Finally, the distribution of codewords among $r$-balls is analyzed in the case of chain poset, when all the blocks are of same length.</description>

      <title>Complexity of approximate conflict-free, linearly-ordered, and nonmonochromatic hypergraph colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction problems, we establish complexity classifications of three natural variants of hypergraph colourings: standard nonmonochromatic colourings, conflict-free colourings, and linearly-ordered colourings.
  Firstly, we show that finding an $\ell$-colouring of a $k$-colourable $r$-uniform hypergraph is NP-hard for all constant $2\leq k\leq \ell$ and $r\geq 3$. This provides a shorter proof of a celebrated result by Dinur et al. [FOCS'02/Combinatorica'05].
  Secondly, we show that finding an $\ell$-conflict-free colouring of an $r$-uniform hypergraph that admits a $k$-conflict-free colouring is NP-hard for all constant $3\leq k\leq\ell$ and $r\geq 4$, except for $r=4$ and $k=2$ (and any $\ell$); this case is solvable in polynomial time. The case of $r=3$ is the standard nonmonochromatic colouring, and the case of $r=2$ is the notoriously difficult open problem of approximate graph colouring.
  Thirdly, we show that finding an $\ell$-linearly-ordered colouring of an $r$-uniform hypergraph that admits a $k$-linearly-ordered colouring is NP-hard for all constant $3\leq k\leq\ell$ and $r\geq 4$, thus improving on the results of Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'y~[ICALP'22/ACM TocT'23].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lefschetz properties and inverse systems have played key roles in understanding the $h$-vector of simplicial spheres. In 1996, Lee established connections between these two algebraic tools and rigidity theory, an area often used in the study of motions of geometric complexes. One of the key ideas, is to translate geometric information about a complex, coming from vertex coordinates, to the algebraic notion of a linear system of parameters. In this paper, we explore similar connections in the nonlinear case, by using recent results of Herzog and Moradi (2021) where they prove that a subset of the elementary symmetric polynomials is always a system of parameters for the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a complex. We investigate connections to the study of Lefschetz properties of monomial ideals. Using this perspective, we recover and extend the well known result of Migliore, Mir\'o-Roig and Nagel on the failure of the WLP of monomial almost complete intersections, by showing that, with one simple exception, every homology sphere has a monomial artinian reduction failing the weak Lefschetz property.
  Finally, we state probabilistic consequences of our results under a model introduced by Linial and Meshulam. We prove that there exists an open interval for the probability parameter where failure of Lefschetz properties of monomial ideals should be expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cut-and-paste $K$-theory is a new variant of higher algebraic $K$-theory that has proven to be useful in problems involving decompositions of combinatorial and geometric objects, e.g., scissors congruence of polyhedra and reconstruction problems in graph theory. In this paper, we show that this novel machinery can also be used in the study of matroids. Specifically, via the $K$-theory of categories with covering families developed by Bohmann-Gerhardt-Malkiewich-Merling-Zakharevich, we realize the Tutte polynomial map of Brylawski (also known as the universal Tutte-Grothendieck invariant for matroids) as the $K_0$-homomorphism induced by a map of $K$-theory spectra.</description>

Abstract: The extended adjacency matrix of a graph with $n$ vertices is a real symmetric matrix of order $n\times n$ whose $(i,j)$-th entry is the average of the ratio of the degree of the vertex $i$ to that of the vertex $j$ and its reciprocal when $i,j$ are adjacent and zero otherwise. The aggregate of absolute eigenvalues of the extended adjacency matrix is termed the extended energy.
  In this paper, the concept of extended vertex energy is introduced, and some bounds of extended vertex energy are obtained. From there, we establish some new upper bounds of the extended energy of a graph involving order, size, largest, and smallest degree. We show that those are improvements of some existing bounds. Through direct manipulation, we have also established some more upper and lower bounds of extended energy, which are either better or incomparable with the existing bounds. Finally, some improved bounds of Nordhaus-Gaddum-type are found.</description>

Abstract: We show that a graph contains a large wall as a strong immersion minor if and only if the graph does not admit a tree-cut decomposition of small `width', which is measured in terms of its adhesion and the path-likeness of its torsos.</description>

      <title>The change-making problem for six coin values and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The change-making problem asks: given a positive integer $v$ and a collection $C$ of integer coin values $c_1=1&lt;c_2&lt; c_3&lt; \cdots&lt; c_n$, what is the minimum number of coins needed to represent $v$ with coin values from $C$? For some coin systems $C$, the greedy algorithm finds a representation with a minimum number of coins for all $v$. We call such coin systems orderly. However, there are coin systems where the greedy algorithm fails to always produce a minimal representation. Over the past fifty years, progress has been made on the change-making problem, including finding a characterization of all orderly coin systems with 3, 4, and 5 coin values. We characterize orderly coin systems with 6 coin values, and we make generalizations to orderly coin systems with $n$ coin values.</description>

Abstract: Discrete signatures are invariants computed from time series corresponding to the discretised version of the signature of paths. We study the algebraic varieties arising from their images, the discrete signature varieties. We introduce them and compute their dimension in many cases. From a particular subclass of these varieties, we derive a partial solution to the Chen-Chow theorem for complex-valued time series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Euclidean oriented matroid program yields a partial ordering of the cocircuits of its cocircuit graph. We show that every linear extension of that ordering yields a topological sweep and induces a recursive atom-ordering (a shelling of the cocircuits) of the tope cell of the feasible region. We extend that sweep and obtain also a vertex-shelling of the whole oriented matroid and finally describe some connections to the notion of stackable zontopal tilings and to a counterexample of a conjecture of A. Mandel.</description>

      <title>On combinatorics of string polytopes in types $B$ and $C$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A string polytope is a rational convex polytope whose lattice points parametrize a highest weight crystal basis, which is obtained from a string cone by explicit affine inequalities depending on a highest weight. It also inherits geometric information of a flag variety such as toric degenerations, Newton-Okounkov bodies, mirror symmetry, Schubert calculus, and so on. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of string polytopes in types $B$ and $C$ by giving an explicit description of string cones in these types which is analogous to Gleizer-Postnikov's description of string cones in type $A$. As an application, we characterize string polytopes in type $C$ which are unimodularly equivalent to the Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope in type $C$ for a specific highest weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that, if removing some $n$ edges from a graph $\Gamma$ destroys all subgraphs isomorphic to a given finite graph $K$, then all subgraphs isomorphic to $K$ can be destroyed by removing at most $|E(K)|\cdot n$ edges, which form a set invariant with respect to all automorphisms of $\Gamma$. We construct the first examples of (connected) graphs $K$ for which this estimate is not sharp. Our arguments are based on a ``weighted analogue'' of an earlier known estimate for the cost of symmetry.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves that the simultaneous lattice packing-covering constant of an octahedron is $7/6$. In other words, $7/6$ is the smallest positive number $r$ such that for every octahedron $O$ centered at the origin there is a lattice $\Lambda$ such that $O+\Lambda$ is a packing in $\mathbb{E}^3$ and $rO+\Lambda$ is a covering of $\mathbb{E}^3$.</description>

Abstract: Let $V$ denote an $r$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-vector space. Let $U$ and $W$ be $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspaces of $V$, $L_U$ and $L_W$ the projective points of $\mathrm{PG}\,(V,q^n)$ defined by $U$ and $W$ respectively. We address the problem when $L_W=L_U$ under the hypothesis that $U$ and $W$ have maximum dimension, i.e., $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q} W=\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q}U=$ $rn-n $, and we give a complete characterization for $r=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the quaternion algebras are central simple algebras and also clifford algebras. In this paper, we introduce a new class of quaternions called Lucas-Leonardo p-quaternions and derive several fundamental properties of these numbers. Furthermore, we investigate some applications related to companion sequences associated with Leonardo quaternions. In particular, we determine Lucas-Leonardo quaternions and Francois quaternions, which are zero divisors and invertible elements in the quaternion algebra over certain finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An association scheme is called amorphic if every possible fusion of relations gives rise to a fusion scheme. We call a pair of relations fusing if fusing that pair gives rise to a fusion scheme. We define the fusing-relations graph on the set of relations, where a pair forms an edge if it fuses. We show that if the fusing-relations graph is connected but not a path, then the association scheme is amorphic. As a side result, we show that if an association scheme has at most one relation that is neither strongly regular of Latin square type nor strongly regular of negative Latin square type, then it is amorphic.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a Galton-Watson tree with a given offspring distribution $\xi$, where $\xi$ is a $Z_{\geq 0}$-valued random variable with $E[\xi] = 1$ and $0 &lt; \sigma^{2}:=Var[\xi] &lt; \infty$. For $n \geq 1$, let $T_{n}$ be the tree $\mathcal{T}$ conditioned to have $n$ vertices. In this paper we investigate $b(T_n)$, the burning number of $T_n$. Our main result shows that asymptotically almost surely $b(T_n)$ is of the order of $n^{1/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ascent sequences were introduced by Bousquet-M\'elou, Claesson, Dukes and Kitaev, and are in bijection with unlabeled $(2+2)$-free posets, Fishburn matrices, permutations avoiding a bivincular pattern of length $3$, and Stoimenow matchings. Analogous results for weak ascent sequences have been obtained by B\'enyi, Claesson and Dukes. Recently, Dukes and Sagan introduced a more general class of sequences which are called $d$-ascent sequences. They showed that some maps from the weak case can be extended to bijections for general $d$ while the extensions of others continue to be injective but not surjective. The main objective of this paper is to restore these injections to bijections. To be specific, we introduce a class of permutations which we call difference $d$ permutations and a class of factorial posets which we call difference $d$ posets, both of which are shown to be in bijection with $d$-ascent sequences. Moreover, we also give a direct bijection between a class of matrices with a certain column restriction and Fishburn matrices. Our results give answers to several questions posed by Dukes and Sagan.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a combinatorial rule satisfied by the signs of principal minors of a real symmetric matrix. The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent to uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and symmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them are not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures and experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the topology of their representation spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $m,n,r,s$ be nonnegative integers such that $n\ge m=3r+s$ and $1\leq s\leq 3$. Let \[\delta(n,r,s)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} n^2-(n-r)^2 &amp;\text{if}\ s=1 , \\[5pt]
  n^2-(n-r+1)(n-r-1) &amp;\text{if}\ s=2,\\[5pt] n^2 - (n-r)(n-r-1) &amp;\text{if}\ s=3. \end{array}\right.\]
  We show that there exists a constant $n_0 &gt; 0$ such that if $F_1,\ldots, F_n$ are 3-partite 3-graphs with $n\ge n_0$ vertices in each partition class and minimum vertex degree of $F_i$ is at least $\delta(n,r,s)+1$ for $i \in [n]$ then $\{F_1,\ldots,F_n\}$ admits a rainbow perfect matching. This generalizes a result of Lo and Markstr\"om on the vertex degree threshold for the existence of perfect matchings in 3-partite 3-graphs. In this proof, we use a fractional rainbow matching theory obtained by Aharoni et al. to find edge-disjoint fractional perfect matching.</description>

Abstract: A hollow matrix is a square matrix whose diagonal entries are all equal to zero. Define $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, where $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. We show that for every $\lambda &lt; \lambda^*$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if a symmetric hollow integer matrix has an eigenvalue less than $-\lambda$, then one of its principal submatrices of order at most $n$ does as well. However, the same conclusion does not hold for any $\lambda \ge \lambda^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $S$ be a subset of $G$. The bi-Cayley graph $\mathrm{BCay}(G,S)$ is the graph with vertex set $G\times \{0,1\}$ and edge set $\{\{(x,0),(sx,1)\}\mid x\in G,s\in S\}$. A bi-Cayley graph $\mathrm{BCay}(G,S)$ is called a BCI-graph if for every $T\subseteq G$, the isomorphism $\mathrm{BCay}(G,S)\cong \mathrm{BCay}(G,T)$ implies that $T=gS^\alpha$ for some $g\in G$ and $\alpha\in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$. We say a group $G$ an $m$-BCI-group if every bi-Cayley graphs of $G$ with valency at most $m$ is a BCI-graph. In this paper, we show that for $m\in\{2,3\}$, the generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ with $n\geq 2$ is an $m$-BCI-group if and only if it is an $m$-DCI-group if and only if it is an $m$-CI-group if and only if $n$ is odd or $n=2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $n$, $k$, $t$, $s$ be positive integers with $n\geq k\geq t$, and $\mathcal{F}$ a family of $k$-subsets of an $n$-set. The family $\mathcal{F}$ is called $s$-almost $t$-intersecting if $\left|\left\{F^{\prime}\in\mathcal{F}: \left|F^{\prime}\cap F\right|&lt;t\right\}\right|\leq s$ for any $F\in \mathcal{F}$. In this paper, we prove that an $s$-almost $t$-intersecting family with the maximum size is $t$-intersecting. We also describe the maximum-sized $s$-almost $t$-intersecting family which is not $t$-intersecting.</description>

      <title>On the matching arrangement of a graph, improper weight function problem and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents examples of an application of the finite field method for the computation of the characteristic polynomial of the matching arrangement of a graph. Weight functions on edges of a graph with weights from a finite field are divided into proper and improper functions in connection with proper colorings of vertices of the matching polytope of a graph. An improper weight function problem is introduced, a proof of its NP-completeness is presented, and a knapsack-like public key cryptosystem is constructed based on the improper weight function problem.</description>

      <title>Edge-graceful usual fan graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ with $p$ vertices and $q$ edges is said to be edge-graceful if its edges can be labeled from $1$ through $q$, in such a way that the labels induced on the vertices by adding over the labels of incident edges modulo $p$ are distinct. A known result under this topic is Lo's Theorem, which states that if a graph $G$ with $p$ vertices and $q$ edges is edge-graceful, then $p\Big|\Big(q^{2}+q-\dfrac{p(p-1)}{2}\Big)$.
  This paper presents novel results on the edge-gracefulness of the usual fan graphs. Using Lo's Theorem, the concepts of divisibility and Diophantine equations, and a computer program created, we determine all edge-graceful usual fan graphs $F_{1,n}$ with their corresponding edge-graceful labels.</description>

      <title>$k$-loose elements and $k$-paving matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a matroid of rank $r$ and a non-negative integer $k$, an element is called $k$-loose if every circuit containing it has size greater than $r-k$. Zaslavsky and the author characterized all binary matroids with a $1$-loose element. In this paper, we establish a sharp linear bound on the size of a binary matroid, in terms of its rank, that contains a $k$-loose element. A matroid is called $k$-paving if all its elements are $k$-loose. Rajpal showed that for a prime power $q$, the rank of a $GF(q)$-matroid that is $k$-paving is bounded. We provide a bound on the rank of $GF(q)$-matroids that are cosimple and have two $k$-loose elements. Consequently, we deduce a bound on the rank of $GF(q)$-matroids that are $k$-paving. Additionally, we provide a bound on the size of binary matroids that are $k$-paving.</description>

      <title>Total restrained coalitions in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $S\subseteq V$ in an isolate-free graph $G$ is a total restrained dominating set, abbreviated TRD-set, if every vertex in $V$ is adjacent to a vertex in $S$, and every vertex in $V\setminus S$ is adjacent to a vertex in $V\setminus S$. A total restrained coalition is made up of two disjoint sets of vertices $X$ and $Y$ of $G$, neither of which is a TRD-set but their union $X\cup Y$ is a TRD-set. A total restrained coalition partition of a graph $G$ is a partition $\Phi=\{V_1, V_2,\dots,V_k\}$ such that for all $i \in [k]$, the set $V_i$ forms a total restrained coalition with another set $V_j$ for some $j$, where $j\in [k]\setminus{i}$. The total restrained coalition number $C_{tr}(G)$ in $G$ equals the maximum order of a total restrained coalition partition in $G$. In this work, we initiate the study of total restrained coalition in graphs and its properties.</description>

      <title>Hom complexes of graphs whose codomains are square-free</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ of graphs is a simplicial complex associated to a pair of graphs $G$ and $H$, and its homotopy type is of interest in the graph coloring problem and the homomorphism reconfiguration problem. %Recently, Soichiro Fujii, Yuni Iwamasa, Kei Kimura, Yuta Nozaki and Akira Suzuki showed that if $G$ is a connected graph and $H$ is a cycle graph then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is contractible or homotopy equivalent to a circle. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a connected graph and $H$ is a square-free connected graph, then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a point, a circle, $H$ or a connected double cover over $H$. We also obtain a certain relation between the fundamental group of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ and realizable walks studied in the homomorphism reconfiguration problem.</description>

      <title>On graphs with large third eigenvalue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\lambda_3$ denote the third largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we prove various results towards the conjecture that $\lambda_3(G) \le \frac{|V(G)|}{3}$, motivated by a question of Nikiforov. We generalise the known constructions that yield $\lambda_3(G) = \frac{|V(G)|}{3} - 1$ and prove the inequality holds for $G$ strongly regular, a regular line graph or a Cayley graph on an abelian group. We also consider the extended problem of minimising $\lambda_{n-1}$ on weighted graphs and reduce the existence of a minimiser with simple final eigenvalue to a vertex multiplication of a graph on 11 vertices. We prove that the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over weighted graphs is at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ from the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over unweighted graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the large Cartesian powers of any graph have log-concave valencies with respect to a ffxed vertex. We show that the series of valencies of distance regular graphs is log-concave, thus improving on a result of (Taylor, Levingston, 1978). Consequences for strongly regular graphs, two-weight codes, and completely regular codes are derived. By P-Q duality of association schemes the series of multiplicities of Q-polynomial association schemes is shown, under some assumption, to be log-concave.</description>

      <title>A class of weighted Delannoy numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted Delannoy numbers are defined by the recurrence relation $f_{m,n}=\alpha f_{m-1,n}+ \beta f_{m,n-1}+ \gamma f_{m-1,n-1}$ if $m n&gt;0 $, with $f_{m,n}=\alpha^m \beta^n$ if $n m=0$. In this work, we study a generalization of these numbers considering the same recurrence relation but with $f_{m,n}=A^m B^n$ if $n m=0$. More particularly, we focus on the diagonal sequence $f_{n,n}$. With some ingenuity, we are able to make use of well-established methods by Pemantle and Wilson, and by Melczer in order to determine its asymptotic behavior in the case $A,B,\alpha,\beta,\gamma\geq 0$. In addition, we also study its P-recursivity with the help of symbolic computation tools.</description>

Abstract: In 1955 B. Segre showed that any oval in a projective plane over a finite field of odd order is a conic. His proof constructs a conic which matches the oval in some points and tangents, and then shows that it actually coincides with the oval. The different proof given here parametrizes an affine piece of the oval and shows directly that the parametrization is given by a polynomial of degree $2$.</description>

      <title>Dual Cheeger Constants, Signless 1-Laplacians and Maxcut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.00489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first nontrivial lower bound of the worst-case approximation ratio for the maxcut problem was achieved via the dual Cheeger problem, whose optimal value is referred to the dual Cheeger constant $h^+$, and later improved through its modification $\widehat{h}^+$. However, the dual Cheeger problem and its modification themselves are relatively unexplored, especially lack of effective approximate algorithms. To this end, we first derive equivalent spectral formulations of $h^+$ and $\widehat{h}^+$ within the framework of the nonlinear spectral theory of signless 1-Laplacian, present their interactions with the Laplacian matrix and 1-Laplacian, and then use them to develop an inverse power algorithm that leverages the local linearity of the objective functions involved. We prove that the inverse power algorithm monotonically converges to a ternary-valued eigenvector, and provide the approximate values of $h^+$ and $\widehat{h}^+$ on G-set for the first time. The recursive spectral cut algorithm for the maxcut problem can be enhanced by integrating into the inverse power algorithms, leading to significantly improved approximate values on G-set. Finally, we show that the lower bound of the worst-case approximation ratio for the maxcut problem within the recursive spectral cut framework can not be improved beyond $0.769$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. Its Weyl group is the symmetric group $S_n$. In this paper, we want to describe some Kazhdan-Lusztig right cells containing smooth elements, which is closely related to the study of associated varieties of highest weight modules of $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. Firstly, we give a complete classification of the KL right cells containing only smooth elements. Then we give a sufficient condition for a KL right cell containing only non-smooth elements by using invariant subsequences and a sufficient condition for a KL right cell containing some smooth elements. Finally, we give an efficient algorithm to find out all the smooth elements in a given KL right cell.</description>

      <title>Entanglement statistics of polymers in a lattice tube and unknotting of 4-plats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Knot Entropy Conjecture states that the exponential growth rate of the number of $n$-edge lattice polygons with knot-type $K$ is the same as that for unknot polygons. Moreover, the next order growth follows a power law in $n$ with an exponent that increases by one for each prime knot in the knot decomposition of $K$. We provide the first proof of this conjecture by considering knots and non-split links in tube $\mathbb{T}^*$, an $\infty \times 2\times 1$ sublattice of the simple cubic lattice. We establish upper and lower bounds relating the asymptotics of the number of $n$-edge polygons with fixed link-type in $\mathbb{T}^*$ to that of the number of $n$-edge unknots. For the upper bound, we prove that polygons can be unknotted by braid insertions. For the lower bound, we prove a pattern theorem for unknots using information from exact transfer-matrices. This work provides new knot theory results for 4-plats and new combinatorics results for lattice polygons. Connections to modelling polymers such as DNA in nanochannels are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The capacity of a finite field matrix channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Additive-Multiplicative Matrix Channel (AMMC) was introduced by Silva, Kschischang and K\"otter in 2010 to model data transmission using random linear network coding. The input and output of the channel are $n\times m$ matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On input the matrix $X$, the channel outputs $Y=A(X+W)$ where $A$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times n$ invertible matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and where $W$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times m$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of rank $t$.
  Silva \emph{et al} considered the case when $2n\leq m$. They determined the asymptotic capacity of the AMMC when $t$, $n$ and $m$ are fixed and $q\rightarrow\infty$. They also determined the leading term of the capacity when $q$ is fixed, and $t$, $n$ and $m$ grow linearly. We generalise these results, showing that the condition $2n\geq m$ can be removed. (Our formula for the capacity falls into two cases, one of which generalises the $2n\geq m$ case.) We also improve the error term in the case when $q$ is fixed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general position map $f:K\to M$ of a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex to a $2k$-dimensional manifold (for $k=1$, of a graph to a surface) is a $\mathbb Z_2$-embedding if $|f\sigma \cap f\tau|$ is even for any non-adjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$. We present criteria for $\mathbb Z_2$-embeddability of certain $k$-dimensional complex (for $k=1$, of any graph) to $2k$-dimensional manifolds. These criteria are
  $\bullet$ a `Kuratowski-type' version of the Fulek-Kyn\v{c}l-Bikeev criteria (for $k=1$), and
  $\bullet$ a converse to the Dzhenzher-Skopenkov necessary condition (for $k&gt;1$).
  Our higher-dimensional criterion allows us to reduce the modulo 2 K\"uhnel problem on embeddings to a purely algebraic problem.
  Our proof is interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra. It is based on calculation of generators in the homology of certain configuration space (the deleted product) of certain complex (joinpower).</description>

      <title>Simplices with fixed volumes of codimension 2 faces in a continuous deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $n$-dimensional simplex in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\ge 4$, it is asked that if a continuous deformation preserves the volumes of all the codimension 2 faces, then is it necessarily a \emph{rigid} motion. While the question remains open and the general belief is that the answer is affirmative, for all $n\ge 4$, we provide counterexamples to a variant of the question where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is replaced by a pseudo-Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{p,n-p}$ for some unspecified $p\ge 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fully resolve the Furstenberg set conjecture in $\mathbb{R}^2$, that a $(s, t)$-Furstenberg set has Hausdorff dimension $\ge \min(s+t, \frac{3s+t}{2}, s+1)$. As a result, we obtain an analogue of Elekes' bound for the discretized sum-product problem and resolve an orthogonal projection question of Oberlin.</description>

      <title>Regular Schur labeled skew shape posets and their 0-Hecke modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming Stanley's $P$-partition conjecture holds, the regular Schur labeled skew shape posets with underlying set $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ are precisely the posets $P$ such that the $P$-partition generating function is symmetric and the set of linear extensions of $P$, denoted $\Sigma_L(P)$, is a left weak Bruhat interval in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$. We describe the permutations in $\Sigma_L(P)$ in terms of reading words of standard Young tableaux when $P$ is a regular Schur labeled skew shape poset, and classify $\Sigma_L(P)$'s up to descent-preserving isomorphism as $P$ ranges over regular Schur labeled skew shape posets. The results obtained are then applied to classify the $0$-Hecke modules $\mathsf{M}_P$ associated with regular Schur labeled skew shape posets $P$ up to isomorphism. Then we characterize regular Schur labeled skew shape posets as the posets whose linear extensions form a dual plactic-closed subset of $\mathfrak{S}_n$. Using this characterization, we construct distinguished filtrations of $\mathsf{M}_P$ with respect to the Schur basis when $P$ is a regular Schur labeled skew shape poset. Further issues concerned with the classification and decomposition of the $0$-Hecke modules $\mathsf{M}_P$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Log topological recursion through the prism of $x-y$ swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept of logarithmic topological recursion that provides a patch to topological recursion in the presence of logarithmic singularities and prove that this new definition satisfies the universal $x-y$ swap relation. This result provides a vast generalization and a proof of a very recent conjecture of Hock. It also uniformly explains (and conceptually rectifies) an approach to the formulas for the $n$-point functions proposed by Hock.</description>

Abstract: We give an algorithm that produces all solutions of the equation $\sum_{i=1}^n 1/x_i = 1$ in integers of the form $2^a k^b$, where $k$ is a fixed positive integer that is not a power of $2$, $a$ is an element of $\{0,1,2\}$ that can vary from term to term, and $b$ is a nonnegative integer that can vary from term to term. We also completely characterize the pairs $(k,n)$ for which this equation has a nontrivial solution in integers of this form.</description>

      <title>Bounds and extremal graphs for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set, or simply an MEG-set, of a graph $G$ is a vertex subset $M \subseteq V(G)$ such that given any edge $e$ of $G$, $e$ lies on every shortest $u$-$v$ path of $G$, for some $u,v \in M$. The monitoring edge-geodetic number of $G$, denoted by $meg(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of such an MEG-set. This notion provides a graph theoretic model of the network monitoring problem.
  In this article, we compare $meg(G)$ with some other graph theoretic parameters stemming from the network monitoring problem and provide examples of graphs having prescribed values for each of these parameters. We also characterize graphs $G$ that have $V(G)$ as their minimum MEG-set, which settles an open problem due to Foucaud \textit{et al.} (CALDAM 2023), and prove that some classes of graphs fall within this characterization. We also provide a general upper bound for $meg(G)$ for sparse graphs in terms of their girth, and later refine the upper bound using the chromatic number of $G$. We examine the change in $meg(G)$ with respect to two fundamental graph operations: clique-sum and subdivisions. In both cases, we provide a lower and an upper bound of the possible amount of changes and provide (almost) tight examples.</description>

      <title>Term rewriting on nestohedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define term rewriting systems on the vertices and faces of nestohedra, and show that the former are confluent and terminating. While the associated posets on vertices generalize Barnard--McConville's flip order for graph-associahedra, the preorders on faces generalize the facial weak order for permutahedra and the generalized Tamari order for associahedra. Moreover, we define and study contextual families of nestohedra, whose local confluence diagrams satisfy a certain uniformity condition. Among them are associahedra and operahedra, whose associated proofs of confluence for their rewriting systems reproduce proofs of categorical coherence theorems for monoidal categories and categorified operads.</description>

      <title>Comparing Hilbert depth of $I$ with Hilbert depth of $S/I$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $I$ be a monomial ideal of $S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. We show that the following are equivalent: (i) $I$ is principal, (ii) $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)=n$, (iii) $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)=n-1$.
  Assuming that $I$ is squarefree, we prove that if $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)\leq 3$ or $n\leq 5$ then $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)+1$. Also, we prove that if $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)\leq 5$ or $n\leq 7$ then then $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)$.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Bad Science Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bad science matrix problem consists in finding, among all matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with rows having unit $\ell^2$ norm, one that maximizes $\beta(A) = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{x \in \{-1, 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$. Our main contribution is an explicit construction of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ showing that $\beta(A) \geq \sqrt{\log_2(n+1)}$, which is only 18% smaller than the asymptotic rate. We prove that every entry of any optimal matrix is a square root of a rational number, and we find provably optimal matrices for $n \leq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a flat torus theorem for quadric complexes. In particular, we show that if a non-cyclic free abelian group $G$ acts metrically properly on a quadric complex $X$, then $G \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$ and $X$ contains a $G$-invariant isometric copy of the regular square tiling of the plane. Along the way, we also give a complete proof of the fact that any closed surface subgroup in the fundamental group of a combinatorial 2-complex is represented by a combinatorial map from a cellulation of the surface that is locally injective away from vertices.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. We have studied local changes of the graphs in adding these circles. These graphs are essentially so-called {\it Reeb graphs} of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a deterministic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave deterministic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Combinatorial Approach to Proving Chernoff Bounds and Their Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chernoff bound is one of the most widely used tools in theoretical computer science. It's rare to find a randomized algorithm that doesn't employ a Chernoff bound in its analysis. The standard proofs of Chernoff bounds are beautiful but in some ways not very intuitive. In this paper, I'll show you a different proof that has four features: (1) the proof offers a strong intuition for why Chernoff bounds look the way that they do; (2) the proof is user-friendly and (almost) algebra-free; (3) the proof comes with matching lower bounds, up to constant factors in the exponent; and (4) the proof extends to establish generalizations of Chernoff bounds in other settings. The ultimate goal is that, once you know this proof (and with a bit of practice), you should be able to confidently reason about Chernoff-style bounds in your head, extending them to other settings, and convincing yourself that the bounds you're obtaining are tight (up to constant factors in the exponent).</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>
