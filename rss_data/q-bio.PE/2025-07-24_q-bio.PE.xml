      <title>How animal movement influences wildlife-vehicle collision risk: a mathematical framework for range-resident species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) threaten both biodiversity and human safety worldwide. Despite empirical efforts to characterize the major determinants of WVC risk and optimize mitigation strategies, we still lack a theoretical framework linking traffic, landscape, and individual movement features to collision risk. Here, we introduce such a framework by leveraging recent advances in movement ecology and reaction-diffusion stochastic processes with partially absorbing boundaries. Focusing on range-resident terrestrial mammals -- responsible for most fatal WVCs -- we model interactions with a single linear road and derive exact expressions for key survival statistics, including mean collision time and road-induced lifespan reduction. These quantities are expressed in terms of measurable parameters, such as traffic intensity or road width, and movement parameters that can be robustly estimated from relocation data, such as home-range crossing times, home-range sizes, or distance between home-range center and road. Therefore, our work provides an effective theoretical framework integrating movement and road ecology, laying the foundation for data-driven, evidence-based strategies to mitigate WVCs and promote safer, more sustainable transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Phylogenetic Level-2 Networks with Quartets and Inter-Taxon Quartet Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inference of phylogenetic networks, which model complex evolutionary processes including hybridization and gene flow, remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. Until now, statistically consistent inference methods have been limited to phylogenetic level-1 networks, which allow no interdependence between reticulate events. In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for a statistically consistent inference method for a much broader class: semi-directed level-2 networks that are outer-labeled planar and galled. We precisely characterize the features of these networks that are distinguishable from the topologies of their displayed quartet trees. Moreover, we prove that an inter-taxon distance derived from these quartets is circular decomposable, enabling future robust inference of these networks from quartet data, such as concordance factors obtained from gene tree distributions under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model. Our results also have novel identifiability implications across different data types and evolutionary models, applying to any setting in which displayed quartets can be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Geometry and stability of species complexes: larger species speciate less often</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Species complexes are groups of closely related populations exchanging genes through dispersal. We study the dynamics of the structure of species complexes in a class of metapopulation models where demes can exchange genetic material through migration and diverge through the accumulation of new mutations. Importantly, we model the ecological feedback of differentiation on gene flow by assuming that the success of migrations decreases with genetic distance, through a specific function $h$. We investigate the effects of metapopulation size on the coherence of species structures, depending on some mathematical characteristics of the feedback function $h$. Our results suggest that with larger metapopulation sizes, species form increasingly coherent, transitive, and uniform entities. We conclude that the initiation of speciation events in large species requires the existence of idiosyncratic geographic or selective restrictions on gene flow.</description>
