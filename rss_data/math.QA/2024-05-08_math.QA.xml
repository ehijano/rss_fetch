      <title>Non-anomalous non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D from gapped boundaries of SymTFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalies of non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D QFTs using gapped boundaries of its SymTFT. We establish the explicit relation between Lagrangian algebras which determine gapped boundaries of the SymTFT, and algebras which determine non-anomalous/gaugeable topological line operators in the 1+1D QFT. If the Lagrangian algebras in the SymTFT are known, this provides a method to compute algebras in all fusion categories that share the same SymTFT. We find necessary conditions that a line operator in the SymTFT must satisfy for the corresponding line operator in the 1+1D QFT to be non-anomalous. We use this constraint to show that a non-invertible symmetry admits a 1+1D trivially gapped phase if and only if the SymTFT admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra. We define a process of transporting non-anomalous line operators between fusion categories which share the same SymTFT and apply this method to the three Haagerup fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of fuzzy geometries coupled to fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of the large N limit of a family of quartic Dirac ensembles based on (0, 1) fuzzy geometries that are coupled to fermions. These Dirac ensembles are examples of single-matrix, multi-trace matrix ensembles. Additionally, they serve as examples of integer-valued $\beta$-ensembles. Convergence of the spectral density in the large N limit for a large class of such matrix ensembles is proven, improving on existing results. The main results of this paper are the addition of the fermionic contribution in the matrix ensemble and the investigation of spectral estimators for finite dimensional spectral triples</description>

      <title>On Borel subalgebras of quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a quantum group, we study those right coideal subalgebras, for which all irreducible representations are one-dimensional. If a right coideal subalgebra is maximal with this property, then we call it a Borel subalgebra.
  Besides the positive part of the quantum group and its reflections, we find new unfamiliar Borel subalgebras, for example, ones containing copies of the quantum Weyl algebra. Given a Borel subalgebra, we study its induced (Verma-)modules and prove among others that they have all irreducible finite-dimensional modules as quotients. We give two structural conjectures involving the associated graded right coideal subalgebra, which we prove in certain cases. In particular, they predict the shape of all triangular Borel subalgebras. As examples, we determine all Borel subalgebras of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_3)$ and discuss the induced modules.</description>

      <title>Topological proofs of categorical coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a short topological proof of coherence for categorified non-symmetric operads by using the fact that the diagrams involved form the 1-skeleton of simply connected CW complexes. We also obtain a "one-step" topological proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories, as suggested by Kapranov in 1993. Our analysis is based on a notion of combinatorial homotopy, which we further study in the special case of polyhedral complexes, leading to a second geometrical proof of coherence which is very close to Mac Lane's original argument. We use Morse theory to show that this second method is (strictly) less general than the first. We provide a detailed analysis of how both methods allow us to deduce these two categorical coherence results and discuss possible generalizations to higher categories.</description>

      <title>Degenerations Of Skein Algebras And Quantum Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a joint generalization, called LRY skein algebras, of Kauffman bracket skein algebras (of surfaces) that encompasses both Roger-Yang skein algebras and stated skein algebras. We will show that, over an arbitrary ground ring which is a commutative domain, the LRY skein algebras are domains and have degenerations (by filtrations) equal to monomial subalgebras of quantum tori. For surfaces without interior punctures, this integrality generalizes a result of Moon and Wong to the most general ground ring. We also calculate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of LRY algebras and show they are Noetherian if the ground ring is. Moreover they are orderly finitely generated. To study the LRY algebras and prove the above-mentioned results, we construct quantum traces, both the so-called X-version for all surfaces and also an A-version for a smaller class of surfaces. We also introduce a modified version of Dehn-Thurston coordinates for curves which are more suitable for the study of skein algebras as they pick up the highest degree terms of products in certain natural filtrations.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of $\mathcal F$-cographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of quantum properties of finite graphs, namely, quantum asymmetry, quantum symmetry, and quantum isomorphism. We define the Schmidt alternative for a class of graphs, which reveals to be a useful tool for studying quantum symmetries of graphs. After showing that quantum isomorphic graphs have quantum isomorphic centers and connected components, we solve the aforementioned problems for the classes of cographs and forests. We also compute their quantum automorphism groups for the first time. In doing so, we extend to the noncommutative setting a theorem of Jordan. Using general results on $\mathcal F$-cographs, we extend the precedent results to $\mathcal G_5$-cographs and tree-cographs, two distinct strictly proper superclasses of cographs and forests respectively. Finally, we show that quantum isomorphic planar graphs are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>On a general notion of a polynomial identity and codimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the braided version of Lawvere's algebraic theories and Mac Lane's PROPs, we introduce polynomial identities for arbitrary algebraic structures in a braided monoidal category C as well as their codimensions in the case when C is linear over some field. The new cases include coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, braided vector spaces, Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, etc. We find bases for polynomial identities and calculate codimensions in some important particular cases.</description>
