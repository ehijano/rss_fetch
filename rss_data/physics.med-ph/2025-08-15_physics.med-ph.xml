      <title>Patient-Specific 3D Printed Dynamic Preoperative Planning Models in Modern Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printed preoperative planning models serve a critical role in the success of many medical procedures. However, many of these models do not portray the patient's complete anatomy due to their monolithic and static nature. The use of dynamic 3D-printed models can better equip physicians by providing a more anatomically accurate model due to its movement capabilities and the ability to remove and replace printed anatomies based on planning stages. A dynamic 3D-printed preoperative planning model has the capability to move in similar ways to the anatomy that is being represented by the model, or reveal additional issues that may arise during the use of a movement mechanism. The 3D-printed models are constructed in a similar manner to their static counterparts; however, in the digital post-processing phase, additional care is needed to ensure the dynamic functionality of the model. Here, we discuss the process of creating a dynamic 3D-printed model and its benefits and uses in modern medicine.</description>

      <title>MIMOSA: Multi-parametric Imaging using Multiple-echoes with Optimized Simultaneous Acquisition for highly-efficient quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a new sequence, MIMOSA, for highly-efficient T1, T2, T2*, proton density (PD), and source separation quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Methods: MIMOSA was developed based on 3D-quantification using an interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence with T2 preparation pulse (3D-QALAS) by combining 3D turbo Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) and multi-echo gradient echo acquisition modules with a spiral-like Cartesian trajectory to facilitate highly-efficient acquisition. Simulations were performed to optimize the sequence. Multi-contrast/-slice zero-shot self-supervised learning algorithm was employed for reconstruction. The accuracy of quantitative mapping was assessed by comparing MIMOSA with 3D-QALAS and reference techniques in both ISMRM/NIST phantom and in-vivo experiments. MIMOSA's acceleration capability was assessed at R = 3.3, 6.5, and 11.8 in in-vivo experiments, with repeatability assessed through scan-rescan studies. Beyond the 3T experiments, mesoscale quantitative mapping was performed at 750 um isotropic resolution at 7T. Results: Simulations demonstrated that MIMOSA achieved improved parameter estimation accuracy compared to 3D-QALAS. Phantom experiments indicated that MIMOSA exhibited better agreement with the reference techniques than 3D-QALAS. In-vivo experiments demonstrated that an acceleration factor of up to R = 11.8-fold can be achieved while preserving parameter estimation accuracy, with intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.998 (T1), 0.973 (T2), 0.947 (T2*), 0.992 (QSM), 0.987 (paramagnetic susceptibility), and 0.977 (diamagnetic susceptibility) in scan-rescan studies. Whole-brain T1, T2, T2*, PD, source separation QSM were obtained with 1 mm isotropic resolution in 3 min at 3T and 750 um isotropic resolution in 13 min at 7T. Conclusion: MIMOSA demonstrated potential for highly-efficient multi-parametric mapping.</description>

      <title>In Silico Evaluation of Cardiac Tissue-Engineered Patch Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myocardial infarction significantly degrades heart function, and current treatments can bring forth serious cost and complications including blood clots and infections. To improve the current state of treatment, researchers are developing tissue patches from induced-pluripotent stem cells that can be incorporated into the heart, improving organ function after a myocardial infarction. These tissue patches include surface patches, attached to the epicardium of the heart, and thick transmural patches that replace the infarcted region. However, little is known about the impact of cardiac tissue patches on pump function in a patient's heart. In addition, it is not clear what patch structural properties - such as active stress generation, muscle fiber alignment, or material stiffness - may best augment existing heart tissue. Computational modeling can be used to examine different implementations and patch properties, illuminating the mechanical impact of cardiac tissue patches in the beating heart. In this work, we computationally implement different cardiac tissue patches to understand benefits of particular patch types and properties. We find that in transmural cardiac tissue patches, both activation and fiber alignment improve function. A transmural patch generating 10% of healthy active stress can increase stroke volume by 18%, and higher generated active stress in a circumferential muscle fiber orientation can recover stroke volume by over 50%. Furthermore, we find that surface cardiac tissue patches can enhance heart function slightly despite limiting diastolic filling, especially when fibrotic thinning has occurred. These conclusions identify broad design goals for the engineering of cardiac tissue patches to improve heart function after a myocardial infarction.</description>

      <title>Coaxial Dipole Array with Switching Transmit Sensitivities for ultrahigh field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate dipole antennas with electronically switchable transmit field patterns to improve flip angle homogeneity in ultra-high field MRI
  Methods: An array of eight coaxial dipoles with electronically switchable $B_{1}^{\!+}$ field profiles was constructed. Alteration of the field profiles was accomplished by modulating the currents along the dipoles using a combination of PIN diodes and lumped inductances. The behavior of these reconfigurable elements was studied in numerical electromagnetic simulations and 9.4T MRI measurements, investigating rapid switching of transmit sensitivities during excitation pulses in both single-channel and pTx mode operation.
  Results: For the simulated dipole elements, modulating the current densities along the dipole's axis causes a $\sim$30% change of the $B_{1}^{\!+}$ field between superior and inferior regions of the brain. When rapidly switched during excitation pulses, this degree of freedom can improve flip angle homogeneity, e.g. by a factor of $\sim$2.2 for a two kT points pTx pulse. For the constructed prototype array, the switching effect was observable but weaker, causing $\sim$10% superior-inferior $B_{1}^{\!+}$ variation.
  Conclusion: The proposed coaxial dipole array with switchable transmit sensitivities offers a novel degree of freedom for designing excitation pulses. The approach has the potential to improve flip angle homogeneity without necessitating an expensive increase in the number of independent transmit channels.</description>

      <title>A 240 Elements Matrix Probe with Aberration Mask for 4D Carotid Artery Computational Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound provides enhanced visualization of the carotid artery (CA) anatomy and volumetric flow, offering improved accuracy for cardiovascular diagnosis and monitoring. However, fully populated matrix transducers with large apertures are complex and costly to implement. Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) offers a promising alternative by enabling simplified hardware design through model-based reconstruction and spatial field encoding. In this work, we present a 3D cUSi system tailored for CA imaging, consisting of a 240-element matrix probe with a 40 x 24 mm$^2$ large aperture and a spatial encoding mask. We describe the system's design, characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio. LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast, supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Beam Hardening Correction in Clinical X-ray Dark-Field Chest Radiography using Deep Learning-Based Bone Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark-field radiography is a novel X-ray imaging modality that enables complementary diagnostic information by visualizing the microstructural properties of lung tissue. Implemented via a Talbot-Lau interferometer integrated into a conventional X-ray system, it allows simultaneous acquisition of perfectly temporally and spatially registered attenuation-based conventional and dark-field radiographs. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that dark-field radiography outperforms conventional radiography in diagnosing and staging pulmonary diseases. However, the polychromatic nature of medical X-ray sources leads to beam-hardening, which introduces structured artifacts in the dark-field radiographs, particularly from osseous structures. This so-called beam-hardening-induced dark-field signal is an artificial dark-field signal and causes undesired cross-talk between attenuation and dark-field channels. This work presents a segmentation-based beam-hardening correction method using deep learning to segment ribs and clavicles. Attenuation contribution masks derived from dual-layer detector computed tomography data, decomposed into aluminum and water, were used to refine the material distribution estimation. The method was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on clinical data from healthy subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19. The proposed approach reduces bone-induced artifacts and improves the homogeneity of the lung dark-field signal, supporting more reliable visual and quantitative assessment in clinical dark-field chest radiography.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework from Boltzmann Transport to Proton Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a rigorous mathematical formulation of proton transport by integrating both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. The deterministic framework is based on the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation, formulated as an operator equation in a suitable functional setting. The stochastic approach models proton evolution via a track-length parameterised diffusion process, whose infinitesimal generator provides an alternative description of transport.
  A key result is the duality between the stochastic and deterministic formulations, established through the adjoint relationship between the transport operator and the stochastic generator. We prove that the resolvent of the stochastic process corresponds to the Green's function of the deterministic equation, providing a natural link between fluence-based and particle-based transport descriptions. The theory is applied to dose computation, where we show that the classical relation: dose = (fluence * mass stopping power) arises consistently in both approaches.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a hybrid optimisation framework for treatment planning, in which dose is computed using a stochastic model while optimisation proceeds via adjoint-based PDE methods. We prove existence and differentiability of the objective functional and derive the first-order optimality system. This framework bridges stochastic simulation with deterministic control theory and provides a foundation for future work in constrained, adaptive and uncertainty-aware optimisation in proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Repair on Dynamic Patient-Specific Left Atrioventricular Valve Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a dynamic, image-derived patient-specific physical simulation platform for the assessment of left atrioventricular valve (LAVV) repair strategies in pediatric patients with repaired atrioventricular canal defects. Methods: 3D transesophageal echocardiographic images of two patients with regurgitant LAVVs were identified from an institutional database. Custom code in SlicerHeart was used to segment leaflets, define the annulus, and generate patient-specific valve molds. Silicone valve models were fabricated and tested in a pulse duplicator under simulated physiological conditions. Five unrepaired valves were analyzed for manufacturing consistency, and multiple surgical repair techniques were compared for two patient-specific models. Results: Manufacturing variability was low in annular metrics (CV for annular circumference: 2.1; commissural distance: 4.1; annulus height: 14.7) but higher in leaflet closure metrics (billow height: 11.1%; billow volume: 18.9%; tenting height: 45.9%; tenting volume: 73.5%). In Patient 1, cleft closure and an Alfieri stitch both eliminated the regurgitant orifice area, but the Alfieri stitch resulted in elevated mean pressure gradient (17 mmHg vs. 4-9 mmHg for other repairs) and deteriorated with repeated loading. In Patient 2, no repair eliminated regurgitation entirely; however, combining an 11 mm patch augmentation with commissuroplasty reduced regurgitant area to 0.147 cm2, the smallest observed among tested strategies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a dynamic physical simulation platform for preclinical LAVV repair evaluation. This proof-of-concept work highlights the platform potential for refining repair strategies before clinical application, which may be particularly relevant in small and heterogeneous populations with congenital heart disease.</description>
