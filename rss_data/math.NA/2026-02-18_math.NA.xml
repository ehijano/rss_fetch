      <title>Certified Reduced-Order Surrogates and Stability Margins in Viscous Incompressible Flow and Fluid--Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(u,p)$ solve the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in a regime in which an energy inequality is available and each constant in that inequality is computable from declared data. We construct a reduced-order model $u_n$ constrained so that its discrete evolution satisfies a certified energy inequality. This certificate yields global-in-time boundedness of the ROM energy and a regime-of-validity test that fails when a stated hypothesis fails.
  It follows that one can attach a computable residual functional $\mathcal{R}_n$ to the ROM trajectory. We prove an a posteriori bound of the form \[ \norm{u-u_n}_{\mathsf{X}(0,T)} \le C(\text{declared data})\,\mathcal{R}_n, \] with $C$ explicit and with $\mathcal{R}_n$ computed from the ROM and the discretization operators. Conversely, if the certificate constraint is relaxed, the bound can fail even for stable full-order dynamics, by an explicit instability mechanism recorded in the text.
  We then derive transition indicators from rigorous energy and enstrophy budgets in simplified geometries. Each indicator is an inequality involving declared quantities such as forcing norms, viscosity, Poincar\'e-type constants, and a computable resolvent surrogate. These inequalities provide thresholds that preclude transition, or else certify the presence of transient growth beyond a stated level.
  Finally, for a class of fluid--structure interaction models, we identify a parameter regime that implies existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We derive discrete coupled energy estimates that produce computable stability margins. These margins yield explicit constraints on time step and mesh parameters. They are stated as inequalities with constants determined by fluid viscosity, structure stiffness, density ratios, and interface trace bounds.</description>

      <title>A Unified Benchmark of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful mesh-free framework for solving ordinary and partial differential equations by embedding the governing physical laws directly into the loss function. However, their classical formulation relies on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), whose fixed activation functions and global approximation biases limit performance in problems with oscillatory behavior, multiscale dynamics, or sharp gradients. In parallel, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been introduced as a functionally adaptive architecture based on learnable univariate transformations along each edge, providing richer local approximations and improved expressivity. This work presents a systematic and controlled comparison between standard MLP-based PINNs and their KAN-based counterparts, Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), using identical physics-informed formulations and matched parameter budgets to isolate the architectural effect. Both models are evaluated across a representative collection of ODEs and PDEs, including cases with known analytical solutions that allow direct assessment of gradient reconstruction accuracy. The results show that PIKANs consistently achieve more accurate solutions, converge in fewer iterations, and yield superior gradient estimates, highlighting their advantage for physics-informed learning. These findings underline the potential of KAN-based architectures as a next-generation approach for scientific machine learning and provide rigorous evidence to guide model selection in differential equation solving.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving &amp; objective discretisation of SO(3)-matrix rotation fields for finite Cosserat micropolar continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method, dubbed \textbf{\textit{Geometric Structure-Preserving Interpolation ({\Gamma}-SPIN)}}, to simultaneously preserve physics-constraints inherent in the material parameter limits of the finite-strain Cosserat micropolar model, and satisfy objectivity under superimposed rigid body motions. The method advocates to interpolate the Cosserat rotation tensor using geodesic elements, which maintain objectivity and correctly represent curvature measures. At the same time, it proposes relaxing the interaction between the rotation tensor and the deformation tensor to alleviate locking effects. This relaxation is achieved in two steps. First, the regularity of the Cosserat rotation tensor is reduced by interpolating it into the N\'ed\'elec space. Second, the resulting field is projected back onto the Lie-group of rotations. Together, these steps define a lower-regularity projection-based interpolation. This construction allows the discrete Cosserat rotation tensor to match the polar part of the discrete deformation tensor while remaining objective. This ensures stable behaviour in the asymptotic regime as the Cosserat couple modulus tends to infinity, which constrains the model towards its couple-stress limit. We establish the consistency, stability, and optimality of the proposed method through several benchmark problems. The study culminates in a demonstration of its efficacy on a more intricate curved domain, contrasted with outcomes obtained from conventional interpolation techniques.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of mixed and nonconforming methods on general polytopal partitions. Part I: Multiscale and projection methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equivalence, in the context of a variable diffusion problem, between (conforming) mixed methods and (primal) nonconforming methods defined on potentially general polytopal partitions. In this first paper of a series of two, we focus on multiscale and projection methods. For multiscale methods, we establish the first-level equivalence between four different (oversampling-free) approaches, thereby broadening the results of [Chaumont-Frelet, Ern, Lemaire, Valentin; M2AN, 2022]. For projection methods, in turn, we provide a simple criterion (to be checked in practice) for primal/mixed well-posedness and equivalence to hold true. In the process, we also shed a new light on some self-stabilized hybrid methods. Part II of this work will address (general) polytopal element methods.</description>

      <title>A Patankar predictor-corrector approach for positivity-preserving time integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural processes, such as chemical reactions and wave dynamics, are modeled as production-destruction (PD) systems that obey positivity and linear conservation laws. Classical time integrators do not guarantee positivity and can produce negative or nonphysical numerical solutions. This paper presents a modular correction strategy that can be applied to implicit Runge-Kutta schemes, in particular SDIRK methods. The strategy combines stage-wise clipping with a ratio-based scaling that enforces invariants and is guaranteed to yield nonnegative, conservative solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of the corrected schemes and characterize their worst-case order of accuracy relative to the underlying base method. Numerical experiments on stiff ODE systems (Robertson, MAPK, stratospheric chemistry) and a nonlinear PDE (the Korteweg-De Vries equation) demonstrate that the corrected SDIRK methods preserve positivity and invariants without significant loss of accuracy. Importantly, corrections applied only to the final stage are sufficient in practice, while applying them at all stages may distort dynamics in some cases. For explicit Runge-Kutta schemes, the correction maintained positivity but reduced convergence to first order. These results show that the proposed framework provides a simple and effective way to construct positivity-preserving integrators for stiff PD systems.</description>

      <title>Total variation regularization with reduced basis in electrical impedance tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers using reduced basis techniques in connection to (smoothened) total variation regularization in electrical impedance tomography, but analogous ideas can also be used for other inverse elliptic boundary value problems. It is demonstrated that resorting to reduced bases can speed up a reconstruction algorithm based on combining the lagged diffusivity algorithm with sequential linearizations and preconditioned LSQR iteration without any significant loss of reconstruction quality or of the edge-enhancing nature of total variation regularization. The ideas are numerically tested in three dimensions on unstructured finite element meshes with both simulated and experimental data, resulting in online reconstruction times of only a few seconds on a standard laptop computer.</description>

      <title>A discrete gradient scheme for preserving QSR-dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of dissipative dynamical systems provides a formal description of processes that cannot generate energy internally. For these systems, changes in energy can only occur due to an external energy supply or dissipation effects. Unfortunately, dissipative properties tend to deteriorate in numerical computations, especially in nonlinear systems. Discrete gradient methods can help mitigate this problem. In this paper, we present a class of structure-preserving time discretization schemes based on discrete gradients for a special class of systems that are dissipative with respect to a quadratic supply rate.</description>

      <title>A Model Order Reduction Method for Seismic Applications Using the Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise and analyze a reduced basis model order reduction (MOR) strategy for an abstract wave problem with vanishing initial conditions and a source term given by the product of a temporal Ricker wavelet and a spatial profile. Such wave problems comprise the acoustic and elastic wave equations, with applications in seismic modeling. Motivated by recent Laplace-domain MOR methodologies, we construct reduced bases that approximate the time-domain solution with exponential accuracy. We prove convergence bounds that are explicit and robust with respect to the parameters controlling the Ricker wavelet's shape and width and identify an intrinsic accuracy limit dictated by the wavelet's value at the initial time. In particular, the resulting error bound is independent of the underlying Galerkin discretization space and yields computable criteria for the regime in which exponential convergence is observed.</description>

      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for Particle-in-Cell Simulations with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-cell methods with stochastic collision models are commonly used to simulate collisional plasma dynamics, with applications ranging from hypersonic flight to semiconductor manufacturing. Code verification of such methods is challenging due to the interaction between the spatial- and temporal-discretization errors, the statistical sampling noise, and the stochastic nature of the collision algorithm. In this paper, we introduce our code-verification approaches to apply the method of manufactured solutions to plasma dynamics, and we derive expected convergence rates for the different sources of discretization and statistical error. For the particles, we incorporate the method of manufactured solutions into the equations of motion. We manufacture the particle distribution function and inversely query the cumulative distribution function to obtain known particle positions and velocities at each time step. In doing so, we avoid modifying the particle weights, eliminating risks from potentially negative weights or modifications to weight-dependent collision algorithms. For the collision algorithm, we average independent outcomes at each time step and we derive a corresponding manufactured source term for the velocity change for each particle. By having known solutions for the particle positions and velocities, we are able to compute the error in these quantities directly instead of attempting to compute differences in distribution functions. These approaches are equally valid for particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions and direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations of neutral gas flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in three dimensions for different couplings between the particles and field, with and without binary elastic collisions, and with and without coding errors.</description>

      <title>SoliDualSPHysics: An extension of DualSPHysics for solid mechanics with hyperelasticity, plasticity, and fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SoliDualSPHysics, a novel open-source and GPU-accelerated software that extends DualSPHysics to enable the numerical simulation of hyperelastic, finite-strain plastic, and brittle fracture behavior in deformable solids within a unified smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. The software implements a total Lagrangian formulation for solid mechanics that allows direct application of external loads and boundary conditions, enabling independent solid mechanics simulations. Brittle fracture is modeled through a phase-field approach coupled with SPH, allowing crack initiation, propagation, and branching under dynamic loading without the need for additional criteria or local refinement. The framework also supports user-defined mathematical expressions to prescribe time- and space-dependent quantities, complementing the solid and fracture extensions and enhancing flexibility across existing and future DualSPHysics applications. Leveraging DualSPHysics' native CPU/GPU parallel architecture, the software achieves substantial computational acceleration for large-scale simulations, and the implementation is verified and validated against benchmark numerical problems and experimental data, demonstrating accuracy, robustness, and favorable scaling performance. Comprehensive implementation details and user documentation are provided to ensure reproducibility and to support further development by the community. The framework and source code are freely available through a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algebraic algorithm for quantum state tomography that leverages measurements of certain observables to estimate structured entries of the underlying density matrix. Under low-rank assumptions, the remaining entries can be obtained solely using standard numerical linear algebra operations. The proposed algebraic matrix completion framework applies to a broad class of generic, low-rank mixed quantum states and, compared with state-of-the-art methods, is computationally efficient while providing deterministic recovery guarantees.</description>

      <title>Multiplierless DFT Approximation Based on the Prime Factor Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix approximation methods have successfully produced efficient, low-complexity approximate transforms for the discrete cosine transforms and the discrete Fourier transforms. For the DFT case, literature archives approximations operating at small power-of-two blocklenghts, such as \{8, 16, 32\}, or at large blocklengths, such as 1024, which are obtained by means of the Cooley-Tukey-based approximation relying on the small-blocklength approximate transforms. Cooley-Tukey-based approximations inherit the intermediate multiplications by twiddled factors which are usually not approximated; otherwise the effected error propagation would prevent the overall good performance of the approximation. In this context, the prime factor algorithm can furnish the necessary framework for deriving fully multiplierless DFT approximations. We introduced an approximation method based on small prime-sized DFT approximations which entirely eliminates intermediate multiplication steps and prevents internal error propagation. To demonstrate the proposed method, we design a fully multiplierless 1023-point DFT approximation based on 3-, 11- and 31-point DFT approximations. The performance evaluation according to popular metrics showed that the proposed approximations not only presented a significantly lower arithmetic complexity but also resulted in smaller approximation error measurements when compared to competing methods.</description>

      <title>Space-filling lattice designs for computer experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of space-filling designs for computer experiments. The space-filling property is characterized by the covering and separation radii of a design, which are integrated through the unified criterion of quasi-uniformity. We focus on a special class of designs, known as quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) lattice point sets, and propose two construction algorithms. The first algorithm generates rank-1 lattice point sets as an approximation of quasi-uniform Kronecker sequences, where the generating vector is determined explicitly. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that this explicit point set achieves an isotropic discrepancy of $O(N^{-1/d})$. The second algorithm utilizes Korobov lattice point sets, employing the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lov\'{a}sz (LLL) basis reduction algorithm to identify the generating vector that ensures quasi-uniformity. Numerical experiments are provided to validate our theoretical claims regarding quasi-uniformity. Furthermore, we conduct empirical comparisons between various QMC point sets in the context of Gaussian process regression, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed designs for computer experiments.</description>

      <title>A Degenerate Elliptic System Solvable by Transport: A Cautionary Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a one-parameter family of first-order real elliptic systems on the plane whose ellipticity constant degenerates to zero as $\delta\to 0$, with condition number $\kappa = O(\delta^{-2})$. For any fixed elliptic solver operating at finite precision, the parameter $\delta$ can be chosen small enough to defeat the solver; no uniform numerical scheme based on the ellipticity constant alone can handle the entire family. Despite this, every member of the family is explicitly solvable -- and its initial value problem well posed -- by elementary means once a transport-theoretic invariant is identified. The cost of the transport solution is independent of $\delta$. The example serves as a cautionary tale: the ellipticity constant alone does not determine the practical difficulty of a first-order PDE. Before invoking an elliptic solver, one should compute the transport obstruction $G$; its vanishing -- or smallness -- signals structure that standard elliptic methods miss entirely.</description>

      <title>Neural-POD: A Plug-and-Play Neural Operator Framework for Infinite-Dimensional Functional Nonlinear Proper Orthogonal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15632</link>

Abstract: The rapid development of AI for Science is often hindered by the "discretization", where learned representations remain restricted to the specific grids or resolutions used during training. We propose the Neural Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Neural-POD), a plug-and-play neural operator framework that constructs nonlinear, orthogonal basis functions in infinite-dimensional space using neural networks. Unlike the classical Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which is limited to linear subspace approximations obtained through singular value decomposition (SVD), Neural-POD formulates basis construction as a sequence of residual minimization problems solved through neural network training. Each basis function is obtained by learning to represent the remaining structure in the data, following a process analogous to Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization. This neural formulation introduces several key advantages over classical POD: it enables optimization in arbitrary norms (e.g., $L^2$, $L^1$), learns mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces that is resolution-invariant, generalizes effectively to unseen parameter regimes, and inherently captures nonlinear structures in complex spatiotemporal systems. The resulting basis functions are interpretable, reusable, and enabling integration into both reduced order modeling (ROM) and operator learning frameworks such as deep operator learning (DeepONet). We demonstrate the robustness of Neural-POD with different complex spatiotemporal systems, including the Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations. We further show that Neural-POD serves as a high performance, plug-and-play bridge between classical Galerkin projection and operator learning that enables consistent integration with both projection-based reduced order models and DeepONet frameworks.</description>

      <title>Regularity and tailored regularization of Deep Neural Networks, with application to parametric PDEs in uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with a smooth activation function as surrogates for high-dimensional functions that are somewhat smooth but costly to evaluate. We consider the standard (non-periodic) DNNs as well as propose a new model of periodic DNNs which are especially suited for a class of periodic target functions when Quasi-Monte Carlo lattice points are used as training points. The primary contribution of this paper is the derivation of explicit bounds for all mixed derivatives of DNNs with respect to their input parameters. The bounds depend on the neural network parameters as well as the choice of activation function, with explicit constants. These bounds are fully general and remain independent of both the target function and the training data. By imposing restrictions on the network parameters to match the regularity features of the target functions, we prove that DNNs with $N$ tailor-constructed lattice training points can achieve the generalization error (or $L_2$ approximation error) bound ${\tt tol} + \mathcal{O}(N^{-r/2})$, where ${\tt tol}\in (0,1)$ is the tolerance achieved by the training error in practice, and $r = 1/p^*$, with $p^*$ being the ``summability exponent'' of a sequence that characterises the decay of the input variables in the target functions, and with the implied constant independent of the dimensionality of the input data. We apply our analysis to popular models of parametric elliptic PDEs in uncertainty quantification. In our numerical experiments, we restrict the network parameters during training by adding tailored regularization terms, and we show that for an algebraic equation mimicking the parametric PDE problems the DNNs trained with tailored regularization perform significantly better.</description>

      <title>Exact operator inference with minimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method to generate snapshot data for operator inference that guarantees the exact reconstruction of intrusive projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs). To ensure exact reconstruction, the operator inference least squares matrix must have full rank, without regularization. Existing works have achieved this full rank using heuristic strategies to generate snapshot data and a-posteriori checks on full rank, but without a guarantee of success. Our novel snapshot data generation method provides this guarantee thanks to two key ingredients: first we identify ROM states that induce full rank, then we generate snapshots corresponding to exactly these states by simulating multiple trajectories for only a single time step. This way, the number of required snapshots is minimal and orders of magnitude lower than typically reported with existing methods. The method avoids non-Markovian terms and does not require re-projection. Since the number of snapshots is minimal, the least squares problem simplifies to a linear system that is numerically more stable. In addition, because the inferred operators are exact, properties of the intrusive ROM operators such as symmetry or skew-symmetry are preserved. Numerical results for differential equations involving 2nd, 3rd and 8th order polynomials demonstrate that the novel snapshot data generation method leads to exact reconstruction of the intrusive reduced order models.</description>

      <title>A time-frequency method for acoustic scattering with trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fourier transform method is introduced for a class of hybrid time-frequency methods that solve the acoustic scattering problem in regimes where the solution exhibits both highly oscillatory behavior and slow decay in time. This extends the applicability of hybrid time-frequency schemes to domains with trapping regions. A fast sinc transform technique for managing highly oscillatory behavior and long time horizons is combined with a contour integration scheme that improves smoothness properties in the integrand.</description>

      <title>Jacobi-accelerated FFT-based solver for smooth high-contrast data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational efficiency and rapid convergence of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based solvers render them a powerful numerical tool for periodic cell problems in multiscale modeling. On regular grids, they tend to outperform traditional numerical methods. However, we show that their convergence slows down significantly when applied to microstructures with smooth, highly-contrasted coefficients. To address this loss of performance, we introduce a Green-Jacobi preconditioner, an enhanced successor to the standard discrete Green preconditioner that preserves the quasilinear complexity, $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$, of conventional FFT-based solvers. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Jacobi-accelerated FFT (J-FFT) solver within a linear elastic framework. For problems characterized by smooth data and high material contrast, J-FFT significantly reduces the iteration count of the conjugate gradient method compared to the standard Green preconditioner. These findings are particularly relevant for phase-field fracture simulations, density-based topology optimization, and solvers that use adaption of the grid, which all introduce smooth variations in the material properties that challenge conventional FFT-based solvers.</description>

      <title>Lattice Random Walk Discretisations of Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a lattice random walk discretisation scheme for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that samples binary or ternary increments at each step, suppressing complex drift and diffusion computations to simple 1 or 2 bit random values. This approach is a significant departure from traditional floating point discretisations and offers several advantages; including compatibility with stochastic computing architectures that avoid floating-point arithmetic in place of directly manipulating the underlying probability distribution of a bitstream, elimination of Gaussian sampling requirements, robustness to quantisation errors, and handling of non-Lipschitz drifts. We prove weak convergence and demonstrate the advantages through experiments on various SDEs, including state-of-the-art diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Fast Solver for the Reynolds Equation on Piecewise Linear Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation is derived from the incompressible Navier Stokes equations under the lubrication assumptions of a long and thin domain geometry and a small scaled Reynolds number. The Reynolds equation is an elliptic differential equation and a dramatic simplification from the governing equations. When the fluid domain is piecewise linear, the Reynolds equation has an exact solution that we formulate by coupling the exact solutions of each piecewise component. We consider a formulation specifically for piecewise constant heights, and a more general formulation for piecewise linear heights; in both cases the linear system is inverted using the Schur complement. These methods can also be applied in the case of non-linear heights by approximating the height as piecewise constant or piecewise linear, in which case the methods achieve second order accuracy. We assess the time complexity of the two methods, and determine that the method for piecewise linear heights is linear time for the number of piecewise components. As an application of these methods, we explore the limits of validity for lubrication theory by comparing the solutions of the Reynolds and the Stokes equations for a variety of linear and non-linear textured slider geometries.</description>

      <title>Flux-Balanced Patankar-type Schemes for the Compressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positivity preservation of key physical quantities in the context of fluid flows, such as density and internal energy, is an essential property of a numerical scheme as otherwise the solution lacks physical relevance and has a not well-defined equation of state. One time integration technique that is capable of preserving the positivity of quantities for every time step size is the Patankar-trick and its variants. However, in the context of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, we wonder whether the Patankar-trick should be applied to the density and total energy equations or only to one of them. In this work, we discuss one drawback of the schemes when blindly applied to every positive conserved variable and additionally point out how to overcome the issue by balancing the involved numerical fluxes correctly. To illustrate our findings, we investigate modified Patankar--Runge--Kutta (MPRK) schemes in the context of the compressible Euler equations with and without stiff source terms. We discover that it is beneficial to only apply the Patankar-trick in the density equation and to balance the remaining numerical fluxes consistently rather than applying the trick also to the energy equation. This leads also to the preservation of contact discontinuities. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate that the accuracy of the methods is maintained while the performance of our approach is superior to the traditional application of MPRK schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse regression strategy for discovery of ordinary differential equations from incomplete and noisy data. Inference is performed over both equation parameters and state variables using a statistically motivated likelihood function. Sparsity is enforced by a selection algorithm which iteratively removes terms and compares models using statistical information criteria. Large scale optimization is performed using a second-order variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt method, where the gradient and Hessian are computed via automatic differentiation. The proposed method is illustrated and tested on several systems with varying levels of noisy and incomplete data. Comparisons are made to a state-of-the-art algorithm for system identification, demonstrating competitiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned difference of convex functions algorithm with extrapolation and line search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel proximal difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm enhanced with extrapolation and aggressive non-monotone line search for solving non-convex optimization problems. We introduce an adaptive conservative update strategy of the extrapolation parameter determined by a computationally efficient non-monotone line search. The core of our algorithm is to unite the update of the extrapolation parameter with the step size of the non-monotone line search interactively. The global convergence of the two proposed algorithms is established through the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz properties, ensuring convergence within a preconditioned framework for linear equations. Numerical experiments on two general non-convex problems: SCAD-penalized binary classification and graph-based Ginzburg-Landau image segmentation models, demonstrate the proposed method's high efficiency compared to existing DC algorithms both in convergence rate and solution accuracy.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended Lubrication Theories for Stokes Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lubrication theory makes use of the assumptions of a long and thin fluid domain and a small scaled Reynolds number to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Extended lubrication theory aims to improve the model accuracy by relaxing these assumptions and including additional terms in the formulation. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our model with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. The magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>
