      <title>Composite colloidal assembly by critical Casimir forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase behaviour of mixtures of two populations of colloidal particles dispersed in a binary solvent system near its critical composition. The surfaces of particles are chemically modified to elicit a specific solvent affinity for one of the solvents. In this way, fluid-mediated interactions, which involve the critical Casimir effect, become particle population specific. As a result, the colloidal mixture shows a complex crystallization behavior reminiscent of the crystallization of atomic alloys. We show that the exquisite temperature dependence and reversibility of the critical Casimir interaction allows sampling the entire phase diagram of the binary system, and can be even used to anneal the crystalline microstructure analogous to temperature cycling of atomic alloy phases.</description>

      <title>Starch granules are instructive scaffolds for synergistic reinforcement and dissipation in hydrogel composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in soft material design is the competition between rigidity and dynamicity, as stiffening mechanisms typically suppress energy dissipation. Here, we demonstrate that starch granules serve as instructive scaffolds that overcome this constraint, enabling the synergistic amplification of both elastic reinforcement and dynamic dissipation in hydrogels. We show that engineering the charge and structure of the filler-matrix interface enhances this synergistic response, which we propose arises from a dual-action physical mechanism: filler-induced polymer bundling of the polymer matrix provides structural reinforcement, while transient filler-matrix hydrogen bonding facilitates dissipation. Moreover, we reveal that binary blends of disparate filler species unexpectedly suppress these emergent properties, which we argue arises from enhanced entropic mixing. Our results provide a physical framework to overcome current design limitations in soft composites and sculpt their viscoelastic response from synergistic enhancement to strategic suppression for applications ranging from high-performance soft robotics to biomimetic tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Anomalous electrowetting of physicochemically heterogeneous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, a physiochemically heterogeneous surface has been fabricated to investigate the electrowetting behaviour of the surface. The polystyrene (PS) micro-humps with varied size are developed on the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, which show an anomalous electrowetting behaviour. The surfaces are observed to be more electro-wettable than it is predicted by the classical Lippmann-Young equation. The observations are well understood considering the chemical heterogeneity of the surface, exhibiting a surface energy mismatch between the PS micro-humps and the PDMS layer. Further, the anomaly is comprehended by following the ridge formation around the triple-phase contact line and the varied surface roughness. A surface parameter is introduced in the Lippmann-Young equation that follows the experimental data with varied values of the parameter representing the physicochemically heterogeneous surfaces. A positive value of the surface parameter indicates strong pinning while a negative value represents depinning of the droplet. This parameter explains the faster electrowetting than predicted by the Lippmann-Young equation.</description>

      <title>Investigating Disordered Granular Matter via Ordered Geometric Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of occupied volume under progressive fragmentation of granular matter is studied using a purely geometric model. Rather than modeling disorder directly, properties of disordered granular assemblies are investigated by analyzing an associated family of highly ordered reference configurations that provide sharp upper bounds on accessible volume. Grains are idealized as fragments derived from a hypothetical elongated parent prism with square cross section, sequentially sliced and reassembled into configurations that maximize the enclosed volume.
  Analytic expressions are derived for the maximal attainable volume at each fragmentation stage. The volume evolution is non-monotonic: initial fragmentation produces structures whose volume exceeds that of the original object, while further fragmentation leads to monotonic decrease converging to a limiting value of 5/4 times the initial volume, independent of the total number of fragments.
  The model reveals pairs of reassembled configurations built from geometrically indistinguishable building blocks yet enclosing different volumes. These conjugate configurations constitute purely geometric analogues of distinct phases connected by rearrangement-induced transitions. Explicit relations link the idealized construction to experimentally measurable grain parameters. Comparison with experimental data on cylindrical rods shows the predicted upper bound falls within the observed packing density range, demonstrating that the model captures essential geometric features despite its simplicity.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Electroviscous Lift Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About forty years ago, it has been predicted that a charged particle, moving parallel to a charged wall in an electrolyte, should experience a lift force that, contrarily to electrostatic forces, is not screened at large distances. Up to now, such electroviscous lift force has not been directly measured. Here, we use Atomic Force Microscopy to directly measure the electroviscous lift force and quantify its dependency with the distance to the wall, the translation velocity or the particle's size. Observing that existing theories exhibit large discrepancies with our experimental observations, we develop an analytical approach combining lubrication theory to a previously introduced formalism for small screening length. The experimentally observed lift forces are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions and reveal, for the first time, a saturation of the lift force for increasing velocities. Altogether, our results characterize, through direct measurements and analytical approach, the properties of electroviscous forces between charged particles in viscous electrolytes in non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>A Variational Formulation for Deformable Particle Simulations and its Level Set Discrete Element Method Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deformable Discrete Element Method (DEM) that extends the classical rigid-particle formulation through a reduced-order description of elastic grain-scale deformation. The method hinges on two developments. First, an energetic variational formulation based on the Lagrange--d'Alembert principle extends classical rigid-body dynamics to incorporate particle deformability by embedding translational, rotational, and deformation degrees of freedom within a unified energetic description. Second, particle deformation is realized within the Level Set DEM formalism through evolving level sets. The framework applies broadly to general particle geometries and topologies, and supports arbitrary deformation modes. The resulting deformable DEM retains the robustness, geometric and physical clarity, and scalability of classical DEM, while enabling physically grounded grain-scale deformability at a computational cost of the same order of magnitude as rigid DEM. Comparisons with full finite-element simulations demonstrate excellent agreement at both particle and system scales, establishing a general and extensible variational framework for modeling deformation in particulate systems.</description>

      <title>Divergent Impact Charging of Polymer Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a particle contacts a surface of another material, it is commonly believed that the particle acquires an impact charge that scales inversely with its pre-impact charge and whose polarity is set by the materials. We show that this belief holds for conductive particles but fails for polymers. For polymers, the impact charge increases linearly with the particle's pre-impact charge. Its polarity is not determined by the materials but by the pre-impact particle charge relative to a divergence point at which the net charge transfer reverses. We attribute this divergence to the attraction of surrounding ions to the particle surface. These attracted ions carry polarity opposite to that of the particle, and their amount scales with the particle charge. They transfer to the opposing surface during contact, thereby defining the impact charge. We propose a phenomenological model for the divergent impact charge arising from this mechanism. Finally, we reexamine previous measurements and show that they support this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Modulated Anti-Ferroelectric Smectic Phases with Orthogonal and Tilted Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the ferroelectric nematic phase has brought with it a plethora of new polar liquid crystalline phases. One in particular is the anti-ferroelectric smectic A SmA\textsubscript{AF} phase. In this letter we show via observation and analysis of satellite peaks in the X-ray scattering pattern that the structure of the SmA\textsubscript{AF} phase involves a density modulation of $\approx$10-20 nm lateral to the smectic layer normal. Further, we demonstrate a previously undiscovered phase where the anti-ferroelectric order is maintained into a tilted smectic phase demonstrating the robustness of the underlying frustration that leads to the modulated structure. We suggest that the modulations are only in a single dimension and appear parallel to the tilt plane. This new phase also shows a significantly different and complex response to an electric field from other discovered polar LC phases due to the ability to modulate both tilt and polarisation direction.</description>

      <title>A versatile FEM framework with native GPU scalability via globally-applied AD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-based finite-element formulations provide a unified framework for describing complex physical systems in computational mechanics. In these energy-based methods, the governing equations can be obtained directly by considering the derivatives of a single global energy functional. While Automatic Differentiation (AD) can be used to automate the generation of these derivatives, current frameworks face a clear trade-off based primarily on the scale upon which the AD method is applied. Globally applied AD offers high expressivity but cannot currently be scaled to large problems. Locally applied AD scales well through traditional assembly methods, but the variety of physics and couplings that the framework can easily represent is more limited than the global approach. Here, we introduce an energy-centric framework tatva (https://github.com/smec-ethz/tatva) that defines the physics of a problem as a single global functional and applies AD globally to generate residual and tangent operators. By leveraging Jacobian-vector products for matrix-free solvers and coloring-based sparse differentiation for materializing sparse tangent stiffness matrices when needed, our flexible design scales linearly with the problem size on GPUs. We demonstrate that our framework can handle large problems (with millions of degrees of freedom) without memory exhaustion. Additionally, it offers a unified, fully differentiable methodology that can address a wide range of problems, including multi-point constraints, mixed-dimensional coupling, and the incorporation of neural networks, while maintaining high performance and scalability on modern GPU architectures.</description>

      <title>Stokes flows in a sessile hemispherical drop due to evaporation and surface tension gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscous hydrodynamic flow in a small, slowly evaporating, sessile hemispherical droplet with a pinned contact line is considered. Analytical solutions are obtained for the Deegan outward flow, which is responsible for the coffee ring effect, as well as the Marangoni flow excited by a surface tension gradient. It is assumed that the surface tension gradient may be caused by anisotropic cooling of droplet surface or other factors, such as nonuniform illumination of an optically active surfactant. Two main types of boundary conditions, no-slip and full-slip, are considered in describing the flow-substrate interaction. It is shown that under the no-slip condition, there is a rigid relationship between the evaporation rate and the surface tension gradient, which imposes strict requirements on the temperature regime inside the droplet. This result offers a new vision of the critical Marangoni number, which describes the threshold for the transition of an evaporating droplet from capillary flow to developed Marangoni convection. The results of this work may attract the attention of experimenters to the study of the sensitivity of viscous flow in an evaporating droplet to the liquid-substrate boundary conditions, especially if the system under consideration passes into the Marangoni regime, when the no-slip condition changes to a partial or full slip condition due to the increase in viscous shear stress near the substrate.</description>

      <title>Quaking in Soft Granular Particles with Speed-dependent Friction: Effect of Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous numerical simulation [C.-E. Tsai et al., Physical Review Research \textbf{6}, 023065 (2024)] has shown that, for soft granular particles under quasistatic shearing, incorporating a speed-dependent friction is essential to reproduce the rate-dependent stick-slip fluctuations that have been found in the laboratory experiment [J.-C. Tsai et al., Physical Review Letters \textbf{126}, 128001 (2021)]. As a continuation, here we employ the simulation in a wide range of driving speeds to examine the role of grain inertia in the quaking dynamics. With our Stribeck-Hertz model, we find that having the volume fraction exceeding a critical value $\phi_{\text{c}}$ is a necessary condition for the quaking to occur, and that the value of $\phi_{\text{c}}$ is determined by material parameters only, independent of the driving rate. The effect of grain inertia generally suppresses the occurrence of quaking, and we conclude by presenting the state diagrams which exhibit a progressive narrowing of the quaking regime as the driving speed increases and the disappearance of quaking at an extremely high shear rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of evolution by natural selection leads to phenotypes of increasing fitness. For cellular chemical reaction networks, this means optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. We argue that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Using theory and numerics we show that this mechanism of optimization comes at the price of significant heat dissipation. We compute the heat flux caused by kinetic proofreading in {\it Escherichia coli} and show that it constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat flux experimentally measured in this model organism. We then demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable saturates, and that Nature appears to operate near saturation despite high energetic costs. We conclude that `life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations, causing the co-existing phases to interpenetrate and generate a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous morphology which persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. Active bicontinuous structures are dominated by sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from passive liquid-liquid phase separation which is controlled by saddle-like surfaces. Activity and surface tension control the length scale of the bicontinuous structure. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity as a Generic Mechanism for Demixing in Flocking Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that even weak nonreciprocal alignment leads to large-scale structure formation in flocking mixtures. By combining numerical simulations of a binary Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-grained continuum equations, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase formed by mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase diagram. For aligning populations, this instability results in one species condensing in a single band that travels within a homogeneous liquid of the other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species self-assemble into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the emergence of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species, despite the absence of repulsive interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show that it is generic to nonreciprocal flocks.</description>
