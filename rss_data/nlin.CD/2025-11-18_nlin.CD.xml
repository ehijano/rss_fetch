      <title>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Multi-Scroll Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase space trajectories are fundamentally important for understanding and analysing chaotic attractors. This is mostly carried out by direct numerical solution of the dynamical equations. Though the origin of scrolls can be understood from the properties of dynamical equations, their appearance in the phase space can also be inferred from the geometry and relative orientations of Nambu surfaces, drawn using Nambu Hamiltonians than from direct numerical solutions. Therefore, one can attribute the origin of wings in the phase space due to energy like Nambu surfaces, giving a geometrical interpretation. In this article, we have carried out, both numerical analysis of bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponents(LEs) to characterise chaos and geometric approach by applying the Nambu generalized Hamiltonian mechanics to explain the fundamental reason for the appearance of wings like geometry in the phase space. We have shown how a fixed number of scrolls or wings can appear in the phase space due to specific geometry of the Nambu surfaces and how different geometries are formed when set of parameters are changed.</description>

      <title>Floquet Recurrences in the Double Kicked Top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact quantum recurrences in the double kicked top (DKT), a driven spin model that extends the quantum kicked top (QKT) by introducing an additional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kick. Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = j\pi/2$ and $k_r = j\pi/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_\theta$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = j\pi/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_\theta = \pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_\theta = 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $j\pi/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Degree-of-freedom and optimization-dynamic effects on the observability of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of chaotic systems can only produce high-fidelity trajectories when the initial and boundary conditions are well specified. When these conditions are unknown but measurements are available, adjoint-variational state estimation can reconstruct a trajectory that is consistent with both the data and the governing equations. A key open question is how many measurements are required for accurate reconstruction, making the full system trajectory observable from sparse data. We establish observability criteria for adjoint state estimation applied to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by linking its observability to embedding theory for dissipative dynamical systems. For a system whose attractor lies on an inertial manifold of dimension $d_M$, we show that $m \geq d_M$ measurements ensures local observability from an arbitrarily good initial guess, and $m \geq 2d_M + 1$ guarantees global observability and implies the only critical point on $M$ is the global minimum. We also analyze optimization-dynamic limitations that persist even when these geometric conditions are met, including drift off the manifold, Hessian degeneracy, negative curvature, and vanishing gradients. To address these issues, we introduce a robust reconstruction strategy that combines non-convex Newton updates with a novel pseudo-projection step. Numerical simulations of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation validate our analysis and show practical limits of observability for chaotic systems with low-dimensional inertial manifolds.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics in two-dimensional coupling of quadratic maps</title>

Abstract: This paper examines the structure and limitations of equi-M sets in two-dimensional Complex Quadratic Networks (CQNs). In particular, we aim to describe the relationship between the equi-M set and the parameter domains where the critical orbit converges to periodic attractors (pseudo-bulbs). The two-node case serves as a foundational testbed: its analytical tractability enables the identification of critical phenomena and their dependence on coupling, while offering insight into more general principles. The two-node case is also simple enough to allow for explicit coupling conditions that govern phase transitions between synchronized and desynchronized behavior.
  Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the study reveals that while the period-1 pseudo-bulb closely tracks the boundary of the equi-M set near its main cusp, this correspondence breaks down for higher periods and in regions supporting coexisting attractors. These discrepancies highlight key differences between single-map and coupled dynamics, where equi-M sets no longer provide a full encoding of system combinatorics. These findings clarify the topological and dynamical behavior of low-dimensional CQNs and point toward a sharp increase in complexity as the number of nodes grows, laying the groundwork for future studies of high-dimensional dynamics.</description>

      <title>The interplay of inertia and elasticity in polymeric flows</title>

Abstract: Addition of polymers modifies a turbulent flow in a manner that depends non-trivially on the interplay of fluid inertia, quantified by the Reynolds number $Re$, and the elasticity of the dissolved polymers, given by the Deborah number $De$. We use direct numerical simulations to study polymeric flows at different $Re$ and $De$ numbers, and uncover various features of their dynamics. Polymeric flows exhibit a multiscaling energy spectrum that is a function of $Re$ and $De$, owing to different dominant contributions to the total energy flux across scales. This behaviour is also manifested in the real space scaling of structure functions. We also shed light on how the addition of polymers results in slowing down the fluid non-linear cascade resulting in a depleted flux, as velocity fluctuations with less energy persist for longer times in polymeric flows. These velocity fluctuations exhibit intermittent, large deviations similar to that in a Newtonian flow at large $Re$, but differ more and more as $Re$ becomes smaller. This observation is further supported by the statistics of fluid energy dissipation in polymeric flows, whose distributions collapse on to the Newtonian at large $Re$, but increasingly differ from it as $Re$ decreases. We also show that polymer dissipation is significantly less intermittent compared to fluid dissipation, and even less so when elasticity becomes large. Polymers, on an average, dissipate more energy when they are stretched more, which happens in extensional regions of the flow. However, owing to vortex stretching, regions with large rotation rates also correlate with large polymer extensions, albeit to a relatively less degree than extensional regions.</description>
