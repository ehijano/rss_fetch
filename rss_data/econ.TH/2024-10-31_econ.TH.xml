      <title>Strategic communication of narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conceptualize the communication of narratives as a cheap-talk game under model uncertainty. The sender has private information about the true data generating process of publicly observable data. The receiver is uncertain about how to interpret the data, but aware of the sender's incentives to strategically provide interpretations ("narratives") in her favor. We consider a general class of decision rules under ambiguity resolving the receiver's ignorance of the true data generating process, including maximum likelihood expected utility. The set of equilibria is characterized by a positive integer $N$: there is an equilibrium that induces $n$ different actions for each $1\leq n \leq N$. The diverting power of the sender is weaker than with a na\"ive receiver being unaware of the sender's incentives. Surprisingly, the receiver sometimes prefers to be na\"ive.</description>

      <title>Central Bank Digital Currency with Collateral-constrained Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10359v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the risks to bank intermediation following the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The CBDC competes with commercial bank deposits as the household's source of liquidity. We revisit the result in the literature regarding the equivalence of payment systems by introducing a collateral constraint for banks when borrowing from the central bank. When comparing two equilibria with and without the CBDC, the central bank can ensure the same equilibrium allocation and price system by offering loans to banks. However, to access loans, banks must hold collateral at the expense of extending credit to firms, and the central bank assumes part of the credit-extension role. Thus, in the equivalence analysis, while the CBDC introduction has no real effects on the economy, it does not guarantee full neutrality as it affects banks' business models. In a dynamic model extension, we analyze the effects of an increase in the CBDC and show that the CBDC not only does not cause bank disintermediation or crowd out of deposits but may foster an expansion of bank credit to firms.</description>

      <title>Performance Rating Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, I introduce a novel performance rating system called Performance Rating Equilibrium (PRE). A PRE is a vector of hypothetical ratings for each player, such that if these ratings were each player's initial rating at the start of a tournament, scoring the same points against the same opponents would leave each player's initial rating unchanged. In other words, all players' initial ratings perfectly predict their actual scores in the tournament. This property, however, does not hold for the well-known Tournament Performance Rating. PRE is defined as a fixed point of a multidimensional rating function. I show that such a fixed point, and hence a PRE, exists under mild conditions. I provide an implementation of PRE along with several empirical applications. PREs have broad applicability, from sports competitions to the evaluation of large language models.</description>
