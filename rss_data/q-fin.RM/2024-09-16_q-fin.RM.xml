      <title>Claims processing and costs under capacity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random delays between the occurrence of accident events and the corresponding reporting times of insurance claims is a standard feature of insurance data. The time lag between the reporting and the processing of a claim depends on whether the claim can be processed without delay as it arrives or whether it remains unprocessed for some time because of temporarily insufficient processing capacity that is shared between all incoming claims. We aim to explain and analyze the nature of processing delays and build-up of backlogs. We show how to select processing capacity optimally in order to minimize claims costs, taking delay-adjusted costs and fixed costs for claims settlement capacity into account. Theoretical results are combined with a large-scale numerical study that demonstrates practical usefulness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Credit Spreads' Term Structure: Stochastic Modeling with CIR++ Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stochastic model for credit spreads. The stochastic approach leverages the diffusion of default intensities via a CIR++ model and is formulated within a risk-neutral probability space. Our research primarily addresses two gaps in the literature. The first is the lack of credit spread models founded on a stochastic basis that enables continuous modeling, as many existing models rely on factorial assumptions. The second is the limited availability of models that directly yield a term structure of credit spreads. An intermediate result of our model is the provision of a term structure for the prices of defaultable bonds. We present the model alongside an innovative, practical, and conservative calibration approach that minimizes the error between historical and theoretical volatilities of default intensities. We demonstrate the robustness of both the model and its calibration process by comparing its behavior to historical credit spread values. Our findings indicate that the model not only produces realistic credit spread term structure curves but also exhibits consistent diffusion over time. Additionally, the model accurately fits the initial term structure of implied survival probabilities and provides an analytical expression for the credit spread of any given maturity at any future time.</description>

      <title>Research and Design of a Financial Intelligent Risk Control Platform Based on Big Data Analysis and Deep Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the financial field of the United States, the application of big data technology has become one of the important means for financial institutions to enhance competitiveness and reduce risks. The core objective of this article is to explore how to fully utilize big data technology to achieve complete integration of internal and external data of financial institutions, and create an efficient and reliable platform for big data collection, storage, and analysis. With the continuous expansion and innovation of financial business, traditional risk management models are no longer able to meet the increasingly complex market demands. This article adopts big data mining and real-time streaming data processing technology to monitor, analyze, and alert various business data. Through statistical analysis of historical data and precise mining of customer transaction behavior and relationships, potential risks can be more accurately identified and timely responses can be made. This article designs and implements a financial big data intelligent risk control platform. This platform not only achieves effective integration, storage, and analysis of internal and external data of financial institutions, but also intelligently displays customer characteristics and their related relationships, as well as intelligent supervision of various risk information</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>
