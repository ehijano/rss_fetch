      <title>Synchronization of coherence resonance oscillators subject to L{\'e}vy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using methods of numerical simulation, we analyze the influence of L{\'e}vy noise on synchronization of excitable oscillators in the regime of coherence resonance. Three cases are under consideration: forced synchronization of a single FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator subject to periodic forcing, mutual synchronization of two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators and ensembles of locally and globally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. It is demonstrated that L{\'e}vy noise provides for transformation of the forced synchronization area such that synchronization can arise or be destroyed through varying the L{\'e}vy noise parameters at fixed frequency and amplitude of the external force. Moreover, the L{\'e}vy noise intrinsic peculiarity can induce the counterintuitive transformation of the synchronization areas such that increasing the external force amplitude gives rise to leaving the synchronization area. In the context of synchronization of coupled oscillators, L{\'e}vy noise is also shown to control the transition to synchronization which can be achieved at lower or higher values of the coupling strength when changing the L{\'e}vy noise parameters. However, such effects are found to be exhibited by ensembles of coupled oscillators, whereas the influence of L{\'e}vy noise on mutual synchronization of two coupled coherence resonance oscillators is minimal and does not lead to significant changes as compared to Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Theory of phase reduction for systems with higher-order interactions: a route to Kuramoto models on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase reduction is a powerful technique in the study of nonlinear oscillatory systems. Under certain assumptions, it allows us to describe each multidimensional oscillator by a single phase variable, giving rise to simple phase models such as the Kuramoto model. Classically, the method has been applied in the case where the interactions are only pairwise (two-body). However, increasing evidence shows that interactions in real-world systems are not pairwise but higher-order, i.e., many-body. Although synchronization in higher-order systems has received much attention, analytical results are scarce because of the highly nonlinear nature of the framework. In this paper, we fill the gap by presenting a general theory of phase reduction for the case of higher-order interactions. We show that the higher-order topology is preserved in the phase reduced model at the first order and that only odd couplings have an effect on the dynamics when certain symmetries are present. Additionally, we show the power and ductility of the phase reduction approach by applying it to a population of Stuart-Landau oscillators with an all-to-all configuration and with a ring-like hypergraph topology; in both cases, only the analysis of the phase model can provide insights and analytical results.</description>

      <title>In vitro 2 In vivo : Bidirectional and High-Precision Generation of In Vitro and In Vivo Neuronal Spike Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two bacterial flagella as a stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization with noise is important for understanding biophysical processes at nano- and micro-meter scales, such as neuronal firing and flagellar rotations. To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic thermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small system, ensemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to characterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a model for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an approximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in trajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the {temporal evolution} of the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and verify the analytical results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Human Brain State Analysis Unveils Complexity of Brain Dynamics: Insights from General Anesthesia and ADHD EEG signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system exhibiting rich dynamical behavior across various states, including those induced by anesthesia or neurological disorders. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, our study investigates the underlying complexity and universal patterns in human brain dynamics across states induced by general anesthesia and neurological disorder of inattentive-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We extract relative phase dynamics time series, $\beta(t)$, from EEG signals and compute permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity across the different states using the framework of ordinal patterns. Our results reveal several key findings. First, different brain states exhibit distinct PE values, indicating distinct signatures of information content across states. We find an inverse correlation between entropy and the level of consciousness during general anesthesia. Further, when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition, individual, or $\beta(t)$ time series, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics. Moreover, compared to well-known stochastic processes (linear underdamped Langevin dynamics, active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and fractional Brownian motion), brain data consistently exhibits higher complexity for any given PE value. Multifractal analysis shows this enhanced complexity likely arises from greater multifractal scaling properties compared to stochastic processes. Our findings highlight the power of ordinal patterns in distinguishing various dynamic brain states and uncovering hidden universal patterns in brain dynamics. Our comprehensive characterization of human brain complexity across states offers valuable insights for future research into consciousness, attention disorders, and neural information processing.</description>
