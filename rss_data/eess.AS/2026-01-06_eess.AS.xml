      <title>Speak the Art: A Direct Speech to Image Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called \textbf{Speak the Art (STA)} which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Improving Code-Switching Speech Recognition with TTS Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational code-switching speech remains challenging due to the scarcity of realistic, high-quality labeled speech data. This paper explores multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) models as an effective data augmentation technique to address this shortage. Specifically, we fine-tune the multilingual CosyVoice2 TTS model on the SEAME dataset to generate synthetic conversational Chinese-English code-switching speech, significantly increasing the quantity and speaker diversity of available training data. Our experiments demonstrate that augmenting real speech with synthetic speech reduces the mixed error rate (MER) from 12.1 percent to 10.1 percent on DevMan and from 17.8 percent to 16.0 percent on DevSGE, indicating consistent performance gains. These results confirm that multilingual TTS is an effective and practical tool for enhancing ASR robustness in low-resource conversational code-switching scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Negative Binomial Regression of Afrobeats Chart Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Afrobeats songs compete for attention on streaming platforms, where chart visibility can influence both revenue and cultural impact. This paper examines whether collaborations help songs remain on the charts longer, using daily Nigeria Spotify Top 200 data from 2024. Each track is summarized by the number of days it appears in the Top 200 during the year and its total annual streams in Nigeria. A Bayesian negative binomial regression is applied, with days on chart as the outcome and collaboration status (solo versus multi-artist) and log total streams as predictors. This approach is well suited for overdispersed count data and allows the effect of collaboration to be interpreted while controlling for overall popularity. Posterior inference is conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo, and results are assessed using rate ratios, posterior probabilities, and predictive checks. The findings indicate that, after accounting for total streams, collaboration tracks tend to spend slightly fewer days on the chart than comparable solo tracks.</description>

      <title>MORE: Multi-Objective Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper has greatly expanded their adoption across diverse real-world applications. Ensuring robustness against even minor input perturbations is therefore critical for maintaining reliable performance in real-time environments. While prior work has mainly examined accuracy degradation under adversarial attacks, robustness with respect to efficiency remains largely unexplored. This narrow focus provides only a partial understanding of ASR model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of ASR robustness under multiple attack scenarios. We introduce MORE, a multi-objective repetitive doubling encouragement attack, which jointly degrades recognition accuracy and inference efficiency through a hierarchical staged repulsion-anchoring mechanism. Specifically, we reformulate multi-objective adversarial optimization into a hierarchical framework that sequentially achieves the dual objectives. To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack.</description>

      <title>Towards Prosodically Informed Mizo TTS without Explicit Tone Markings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the development of a text-to-speech (TTS) system for Mizo, a low-resource, tonal, and Tibeto-Burman language spoken primarily in the Indian state of Mizoram. The TTS was built with only 5.18 hours of data; however, in terms of subjective and objective evaluations, the outputs were considered perceptually acceptable and intelligible. A baseline model using Tacotron2 was built, and then, with the same data, another TTS model was built with VITS. In both subjective and objective evaluations, the VITS model outperformed the Tacotron2 model. In terms of tone synthesis, the VITS model showed significantly lower tone errors than the Tacotron2 model. The paper demonstrates that a non-autoregressive, end-to-end framework can achieve synthesis of acceptable perceptual quality and intelligibility.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Spatial Features in Foundation-Model-Based Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in speaker diarization exploit large pretrained foundation models, such as WavLM, to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Systems like DiariZen leverage these rich single-channel representations, but are limited to single-channel audio, preventing the use of spatial cues available in multi-channel recordings. This work analyzes the impact of incorporating spatial information into a state-of-the-art single-channel diarization system by evaluating several strategies for conditioning the model on multi-channel spatial features. Experiments on meeting-style datasets indicate that spatial information can improve diarization performance, but the overall improvement is smaller than expected for the proposed system, suggesting that the features aggregated over all WavLM layers already capture much of the information needed for accurate speaker discrimination, also in overlapping speech regions. These findings provide insight into the potential and limitations of using spatial cues to enhance foundation model-based diarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, largely driven by the emergence of LLM-based ASR paradigm. Despite their strong performance on a variety of open-source benchmarks, existing LLM-based ASR systems still suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are prone to hallucination errors, often generating excessively long and repetitive outputs that are not well grounded in the acoustic input. Second, they provide limited support for flexible and fine-grained contextual customization. To address these challenges, we propose Index-ASR, a large-scale LLM-based ASR system designed to simultaneously enhance robustness and support customizable hotword recognition. The core idea of Index-ASR lies in the integration of LLM and large-scale training data enriched with background noise and contextual information. Experimental results show that our Index-ASR achieves strong performance on both open-source benchmarks and in-house test sets, highlighting its robustness and practicality for real-world ASR applications.</description>

      <title>IO-RAE: Information-Obfuscation Reversible Adversarial Example for Audio Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly accelerated the adoption of speech recognition technology, leading to its widespread integration across various applications. However, this surge in usage also highlights a critical issue: audio data is highly vulnerable to unauthorized exposure and analysis, posing significant privacy risks for businesses and individuals. This paper introduces an Information-Obfuscation Reversible Adversarial Example (IO-RAE) framework, the pioneering method designed to safeguard audio privacy using reversible adversarial examples. IO-RAE leverages large language models to generate misleading yet contextually coherent content, effectively preventing unauthorized eavesdropping by humans and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Additionally, we propose the Cumulative Signal Attack technique, which mitigates high-frequency noise and enhances attack efficacy by targeting low-frequency signals. Our approach ensures the protection of audio data without degrading its quality or our ability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a targeted misguidance rate of 96.5% and a remarkable 100% untargeted misguidance rate in obfuscating target keywords across multiple ASR models, including a commercial black-box system from Google. Furthermore, the quality of the recovered audio, measured by the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality score, reached 4.45, comparable to high-quality original recordings. Notably, the recovered audio processed by ASR systems exhibited an error rate of 0%, indicating nearly lossless recovery. These results highlight the practical applicability and effectiveness of our IO-RAE framework in protecting sensitive audio privacy.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Timbre Transfer Via Mutual Information Guided Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study timbre transfer as an inference-time editing problem for music audio. Starting from a strong pre-trained latent diffusion model, we introduce a lightweight procedure that requires no additional training: (i) a dimension-wise noise injection that targets latent channels most informative of instrument identity, and (ii) an early-step clamping mechanism that re-imposes the input's melodic and rhythmic structure during reverse diffusion. The method operates directly on audio latents and is compatible with text/audio conditioning (e.g., CLAP). We discuss design choices,analyze trade-offs between timbral change and structural preservation, and show that simple inference-time controls can meaningfully steer pre-trained models for style-transfer use cases.</description>

      <title>UltraEval-Audio: A Unified Framework for Comprehensive Evaluation of Audio Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of audio foundation models has accelerated rapidly since the emergence of GPT-4o. However, the lack of comprehensive evaluation has become a critical bottleneck for further progress in the field, particularly in audio generation. Current audio evaluation faces three major challenges: (1) audio evaluation lacks a unified framework, with datasets and code scattered across various sources, hindering fair and efficient cross-model comparison;(2) audio codecs, as a key component of audio foundation models, lack a widely accepted and holistic evaluation methodology; (3) existing speech benchmarks are heavily reliant on English, making it challenging to objectively assess models' performance on Chinese. To address the first issue, we introduce UltraEval-Audio, a unified evaluation framework for audio foundation models, specifically designed for both audio understanding and generation tasks. UltraEval-Audio features a modular architecture, supporting 10 languages and 14 core task categories, while seamlessly integrating 24 mainstream models and 36 authoritative benchmarks. To enhance research efficiency, the framework provides a one-command evaluation feature, accompanied by real-time public leaderboards. For the second challenge, UltraEval-Audio adopts a novel comprehensive evaluation scheme for audio codecs, evaluating performance across three key dimensions: semantic accuracy, timbre fidelity, and acoustic quality. To address the third issue, we propose two new Chinese benchmarks, SpeechCMMLU and SpeechHSK, designed to assess Chinese knowledge proficiency and language fluency. We wish that UltraEval-Audio will provide both academia and industry with a transparent, efficient, and fair platform for comparison of audio models. Our code, benchmarks, and leaderboards are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraEval-Audio.</description>

      <title>SAFE-QAQ: End-to-End Slow-Thinking Audio-Text Fraud Detection via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing fraud detection methods predominantly rely on transcribed text, suffering from ASR errors and missing crucial acoustic cues like vocal tone and environmental context. This limits their effectiveness against complex deceptive strategies. To address these challenges, we first propose \textbf{SAFE-QAQ}, an end-to-end comprehensive framework for audio-based slow-thinking fraud detection. First, the SAFE-QAQ framework eliminates the impact of transcription errors on detection performance. Secondly, we propose rule-based slow-thinking reward mechanisms that systematically guide the system to identify fraud-indicative patterns by accurately capturing fine-grained audio details, through hierarchical reasoning processes. Besides, our framework introduces a dynamic risk assessment framework during live calls, enabling early detection and prevention of fraud. Experiments on the TeleAntiFraud-Bench demonstrate that SAFE-QAQ achieves dramatic improvements over existing methods in multiple key dimensions, including accuracy, inference efficiency, and real-time processing capabilities. Currently deployed and analyzing over 70,000 calls daily, SAFE-QAQ effectively automates complex fraud detection, reducing human workload and financial losses.

      <title>OV-InstructTTS: Towards Open-Vocabulary Instruct Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruct Text-to-Speech (InstructTTS) leverages natural language descriptions as style prompts to guide speech synthesis. However, existing InstructTTS methods mainly rely on a direct combination of audio-related labels or their diverse rephrasings, making it difficult to handle flexible, high-level instructions. Such rigid control is insufficient for users such as content creators who wish to steer generation with descriptive instructions. To address these constraints, we introduce OV-InstructTTS, a new paradigm for open-vocabulary InstructTTS. We propose a comprehensive solution comprising a newly curated dataset, OV-Speech, and a novel reasoning-driven framework. The OV-Speech dataset pairs speech with open-vocabulary instructions, each augmented with a reasoning process that connects high-level instructions to acoustic features. The reasoning-driven framework infers emotional, acoustic, and paralinguistic information from open-vocabulary instructions before synthesizing speech. Evaluations show that this reasoning-driven approach significantly improves instruction-following fidelity and speech expressiveness. We believe this work can inspire the next user-friendly InstructTTS systems with stronger generalization and real-world applicability. The dataset and demos are publicly available on our project page.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: A comparative exploration of Speech-LLM and end-to-end architecture for multilingual conversational ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The INTERSPEECH 2025 Challenge on Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Models (MLC-SLM) promotes multilingual conversational ASR with large language models (LLMs). Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/1535176727/MLC-SLM.</description>

      <title>MOSS Transcribe Diarize: Accurate Transcription with Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly.

      <title>MM-Sonate: Multimodal Controllable Audio-Video Generation with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-Level Transcript Segmentation: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Table-of-Contents Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmenting speech transcripts into thematic sections benefits both downstream processing and users who depend on written text for accessibility. We introduce a novel approach to hierarchical topic segmentation in transcripts, generating multi-level tables of contents that capture both topic and subtopic boundaries. We compare zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning on large language models, while also exploring the integration of high-level speech pause features. Evaluations on English meeting recordings and multilingual lecture transcripts (Portuguese, German) show significant improvements over established topic segmentation baselines. Additionally, we adapt a common evaluation measure for multi-level segmentation, taking into account all hierarchical levels within one metric.</description>

      <title>DARC: Drum accompaniment generation with fine-grained rhythm control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In music creation, rapid prototyping is essential for exploring and refining ideas, yet existing generative tools often fall short when users require both structural control and stylistic flexibility. Prior approaches in stem-to-stem generation can condition on other musical stems but offer limited control over rhythm, and timbre-transfer methods allow users to specify specific rhythms, but cannot condition on musical context. We introduce DARC, a generative drum accompaniment model that conditions both on musical context from other stems and explicit rhythm prompts such as beatboxing or tapping tracks. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we augment STAGE, a state-of-the-art drum stem generator, with fine-grained rhythm control while maintaining musical context awareness.</description>

      <title>On the social bias of speech self-supervised models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks, yet the biased outcomes, especially affecting marginalized groups, raise significant concerns. Social bias refers to the phenomenon where algorithms potentially amplify disparate properties between social groups present in the data used for training. Bias in SSL models can perpetuate injustice by automating discriminatory patterns and reinforcing inequitable systems. This work reveals that prevalent SSL models inadvertently acquire biased associations. We probe how various factors, such as model architecture, size, and training methodologies, influence the propagation of social bias within these models. Finally, we explore the efficacy of debiasing SSL models through regularization techniques, specifically via model compression. Our findings reveal that employing techniques such as row-pruning and training wider, shallower models can effectively mitigate social bias within SSL model.</description>

      <title>pyAMPACT: A Score-Audio Alignment Toolkit for Performance Data Estimation and Multi-modal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: pyAMPACT (Python-based Automatic Music Performance Analysis and Comparison Toolkit) links symbolic and audio music representations to facilitate score-informed estimation of performance data in audio as well as general linking of symbolic and audio music representations with a variety of annotations. pyAMPACT can read a range of symbolic formats and can output note-linked audio descriptors/performance data into MEI-formatted files. The audio analysis uses score alignment to calculate time-frequency regions of importance for each note in the symbolic representation from which to estimate a range of parameters. These include tuning-, dynamics-, and timbre-related performance descriptors, with timing-related information available from the score alignment. Beyond performance data estimation, pyAMPACT also facilitates multi-modal investigations through its infrastructure for linking symbolic representations and annotations to audio.</description>

      <title>Perch 2.0: The Bittern Lesson for Bioacoustics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for bioacoustics.</description>

      <title>CMDAR: A Chinese Multi-scene Dynamic Audio Reasoning Benchmark with Diverse Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and English audio data and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce CMDAR, a Chinese benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. CMDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on CMDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. In CMDAR-main, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio reaches 68.47%. However, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice with multiple audios and open-ended tasks. And we provide detail analysis corresponding suggestions for the future development of large audio language models.</description>

      <title>Generating Piano Music with Transformers: A Comparative Study of Scale, Data, and Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although a variety of transformers have been proposed for symbolic music generation in recent years, there is still little comprehensive study on how specific design choices affect the quality of the generated music. In this work, we systematically compare different datasets, model architectures, model sizes, and training strategies for the task of symbolic piano music generation. To support model development and evaluation, we examine a range of quantitative metrics and analyze how well they correlate with human judgment collected through listening studies. Our best-performing model, a 950M-parameter transformer trained on 80K MIDI files from diverse genres, produces outputs that are often rated as human-composed in a Turing-style listening survey.</description>
