      <title>Lattice Unitarity: Saturated Collisional Resistivity of Strongly Interacting Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction-induced resistivity of ultracold fermions in a three-dimensional optical lattice. In situ observations of transport dynamics enable the determination of real and imaginary conductivity (or resistivity). In the strongly interacting metallic regime, we observe a striking saturation of the current-dissipation rate to a value independent of the interaction strength. This behavior is quantitatively captured by a dissipation model that uses a renormalized two-body scattering matrix. The highest observed dissipation rates approach, but do not reach, the unitarity bound on two-body scattering in the lattice, owing to momentum dispersion. We further measure the temperature dependence of resistivity in the strongly interacting limit and compare it to the predicted asymptotic behaviors. These results provide a clear microscopic understanding of bounded resistivity of low-density metals, thus providing a useful benchmark for studies of strongly correlated atomic and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of low-dimensional Fermi fluids of dipolar atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic cold atoms in optical traps provide viable quantum simulators of correlation effects in electronic systems. For dressed Rydberg atoms in two-dimensional traps with out-of-plane dipole moments, a realistic model of the pairwise interaction is of repulsive dipolar $1/r^3$ form at long range, softened to a constant at short range. This study provides parameterizations of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy data for ferromagnetic (one-component) and paramagnetic (two-component) two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi fluids of interacting dipolar atoms. We find itinerant ferromagnetism to be unstable within our parameter spaces for dipolar interactions both with and without softening. Our parameterization of the energy as a function of density will enable density functional theory to support experimental studies of inhomogeneous fermionic cold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Extracting transport coefficients from local ground-state currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport properties are central to characterizing quantum matter, yet their extraction typically requires external forcing and time-resolved measurements. In this work, we propose a scheme to access transport coefficients directly from measurements of local, static ground-state currents -- quantities readily accessible in quantum-engineered platforms. By exploiting the exponential decay of correlations in gapped systems and the finite velocity of correlation spreading, we demonstrate that the local Hall response can be reconstructed from a small set of quasi-local current observables. We derive explicit relations connecting these static observables to a practical local Chern marker, and introduce a scalable digital protocol for measuring the required generalized currents in cold-atom quantum simulators. Numerical simulations of a non-interacting Chern insulator validate our approach. Moreover, the scheme extends naturally to fractional Chern insulators and other strongly correlated systems, even at finite temperature, offering a broadly applicable route to probing transport in engineered quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation and global convergence of a discrete normalized gradient flow for computing ground states of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient flow with semi-implicit discretization (GFSI) is the most widely used algorithm for computing the ground state of Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional. Numerous numerical experiments have shown that the energy dissipation holds when calculating the ground states of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates (MBECs) with GFSI, while rigorous proof remains an open challenge. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, we reformulate the GFSI into an equivalent form and thereby prove the energy dissipation for GFSI in two-component scenario with Josephson junction and rotating term, which is one of the most important and topical model in MBECs. Based on this, we further establish the global convergence to stationary states. Also, the numerical results of energy dissipation in practical experiments corroborate our rigorous mathematical proof, and we numerically verified the upper bound of time step that guarantees energy dissipation is indeed related to the strength of particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Atomic-superfluid heat engines controlled by twisted light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry--P\'erot cavity where the optical fields carry orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes, whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time challenges. Finally, for lower values of the orbital angular momentum, we describe an alternate scheme for operating quantum heat engines based on the adiabatic elimination of a mechanical mode. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as an experimentally-accessible control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines as desired.</description>

      <title>Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Family of self-dual quasicrystals with critical Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of one dimensional quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models on one end, to those featuring long-range hoppings with varied quasiperiodic modulations on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with richly structured mobility edges separating them. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward critical phases from self-duality considerations, and would facilitate the experimental simulation of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This progress prompts a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>
