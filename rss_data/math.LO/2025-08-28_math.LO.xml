      <title>Consistency formula is strictly stronger in PA than PA-consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that, despite the widespread assumption, the consistency formula for Peano Arithmetic PA, Con(PA), "for all x, x is not a code of a derivation of (0=1)," is not equivalent in PA to the consistency of PA. Specifically, we demonstrate that "PA is consistent" is provably in PA equivalent to the series ConS(PA) of arithmetical sentences "n is not a code of a derivation of (0=1)" for n=0,1,2,.... Since Con(PA) is strictly stronger in PA than ConS(PA), the unprovability of Con(PA) in PA does not yield the unprovability of PA-consistency.</description>

      <title>Plenitudinous Urelements and the Definability of Cardinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Axiom of Plenitude asserts that every ordinal is equinumerous with a set of urelements, while its stronger form, Plenitude$^+$, extends it to all sets. We investigate these two axioms within ZF set theory with urelements. Assuming that cardinality is definable, Plenitude$^+$ unifies the Collection Principle and the Reflection Principle, which are otherwise conjectured to be non-equivalent. If either cardinality is representable or the principle of Small Violations of Choice (SVC) holds, Plenitude$^+$ implies the Reflection Principle. In contrast, Plenitude is considerably weaker: there are models of SVC + Plenitude where Collection fails, and models of SVC + Plenitude + Reflection where Plenitude$^+$ fails.</description>

      <title>An approximate zero-one law via the Dialectica interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-one laws state that probabilistic events of a certain type must occur with probability either $0$ or $1$, and nothing in between. We formulate a syntactic zero-one law, which enjoys good logical properties while being broadly applicable in probability theory. Then, inspired by G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, we finitise it: The result is an approximate zero-one law which states that events with a particular finite structure occur with probability close to $0$ or $1$ up to an arbitrary degree of precision. This approximate zero-one law is equivalent - over classical logic - to the original zero-one law, but in contrast to the latter, is formulated entirely in terms of finite unions and intersections of events. Furthermore, in line with recent logical metatheorems for probability, it admits a computational interpretation, which in turn facilitates a quantitative analysis of theorems whose proof makes use of zero-one laws. Concrete applications in this spirit, over a variety of different settings, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Preconditionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work, we introduced a new semantics for conditionals, covering a large class of what we call preconditionals. In this paper, we undertake an axiomatic study of preconditionals and subclasses of preconditionals. We then prove that any bounded lattice equipped with a preconditional can be represented by a relational structure, suitably topologized, yielding a single relational semantics for conditional logics normally treated by different semantics, as well as generalizing beyond those semantics.</description>

      <title>On conjugacy and perturbation of subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy orbits of certain types of subalgebras in tracial von Neumann algebras. For any separable II$_1$ factor $N_0$ we construct a highly indecomposable non Gamma II$_1$ factor $N$ such that $N_0 \subset N$ and moreover every von Neumann subalgebra of $N$ with Haagerup's property admits a unique embedding up to unitary conjugation. Such a factor necessarily has to be non separable, but we show that it can be taken of density character $2^{\aleph_0}$. On the other hand we are able to construct for any separable II$_1$ factor $M_0$, a separable II$_1$ factor $M$ containing $M_0$ such that every property (T) subfactor admits a unique embedding into $M$ up to uniformly approximate unitary equivalence; i.e., any pair of embeddings can be conjugated up to a small uniform $2$-norm perturbation.</description>

      <title>Prover-Adversary games for systems over (non-deterministic) branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pudlak-Buss style Prover-Adversary games to characterise proof systems reasoning over deterministic branching programs (BPs) and non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs). Our starting points are the proof systems eLDT and eLNDT, for BPs and NBPs respectively, previously introduced by Buss, Das and Knop. We prove polynomial equivalences between these proof systems and the corresponding games we introduce. This crucially requires access to a form of negation of branching programs which, for NBPs, requires us to formalise a non-uniform version of the Immerman-Szelepcsenyi theorem that coNL = NL. Thanks to the techniques developed, we further obtain a proof complexity theoretic version of Immerman-Szelepcsenyi, showing that eLNDT is polynomially equivalent to systems over boundedly alternating branching programs.</description>
