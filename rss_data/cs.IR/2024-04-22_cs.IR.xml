      <title>STaRK: Benchmarking LLM Retrieval on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering real-world user queries, such as product search, often requires accurate retrieval of information from semi-structured knowledge bases or databases that involve blend of unstructured (e.g., textual descriptions of products) and structured (e.g., entity relations of products) information. However, previous works have mostly studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize natural and realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, as well as their ground-truth answers. Moreover, we rigorously conduct human evaluation to validate the quality of our benchmark, which covers a variety of practical applications, including product recommendations, academic paper searches, and precision medicine inquiries. Our benchmark serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems, with an emphasis on retrieval approaches driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that the STARK datasets present significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, indicating the demand for building more capable retrieval systems that can handle both textual and relational aspects.</description>

      <title>MARec: Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many recommender systems the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix which is often very sparse, however, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks, and such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings. The sparsity of the click matrix is the reason matrix factorization and autoencoders techniques remain highly competitive across collaborative filtering datasets. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation. we show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</description>

      <title>Two-Step SPLADE: Simple, Efficient and Effective Approximation of SPLADE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned sparse models such as SPLADE have successfully shown how to incorporate the benefits of state-of-the-art neural information retrieval models into the classical inverted index data structure. Despite their improvements in effectiveness, learned sparse models are not as efficient as classical sparse model such as BM25. The problem has been investigated and addressed by recently developed strategies, such as guided traversal query processing and static pruning, with different degrees of success on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. In this work, we propose a new query processing strategy for SPLADE based on a two-step cascade. The first step uses a pruned and reweighted version of the SPLADE sparse vectors, and the second step uses the original SPLADE vectors to re-score a sample of documents retrieved in the first stage. Our extensive experiments, performed on 30 different in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, show that our proposed strategy is able to improve mean and tail response times over the original single-stage SPLADE processing by up to $30\times$ and $40\times$, respectively, for in-domain datasets, and by 12x to 25x, for mean response on out-of-domain datasets, while not incurring in statistical significant difference in 60\% of datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Collaborative Filtering: A Relook at Task Formulation in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become indispensable in numerous applications, profoundly influencing our everyday experiences. Despite their practical significance, academic research in RecSys often abstracts the formulation of research tasks from real-world contexts, aiming for a clean problem formulation and more generalizable findings. However, it is observed that there is a lack of collective understanding in RecSys academic research. The root of this issue may lie in the simplification of research task definitions, and an overemphasis on modeling the decision outcomes rather than the decision-making process. That is, we often conceptualize RecSys as the task of predicting missing values in a static user-item interaction matrix, rather than predicting a user's decision on the next interaction within a dynamic, changing, and application-specific context. There exists a mismatch between the inputs accessible to a model and the information available to users during their decision-making process, yet the model is tasked to predict users' decisions. While collaborative filtering is effective in learning general preferences from historical records, it is crucial to also consider the dynamic contextual factors in practical settings. Defining research tasks based on application scenarios using domain-specific datasets may lead to more insightful findings. Accordingly, viable solutions and effective evaluations can emerge for different application scenarios.</description>

      <title>ChatRetriever: Adapting Large Language Models for Generalized and Robust Conversational Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational search requires accurate interpretation of user intent from complex multi-turn contexts. This paper presents ChatRetriever, which inherits the strong generalization capability of large language models to robustly represent complex conversational sessions for dense retrieval. To achieve this, we propose a simple and effective dual-learning approach that adapts LLM for retrieval via contrastive learning while enhancing the complex session understanding through masked instruction tuning on high-quality conversational instruction tuning data. Extensive experiments on five conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that ChatRetriever substantially outperforms existing conversational dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on par with LLM-based rewriting approaches. Furthermore, ChatRetriever exhibits superior robustness in handling diverse conversational contexts. Our work highlights the potential of adapting LLMs for retrieval with complex inputs like conversational search sessions and proposes an effective approach to advance this research direction.</description>

      <title>General Item Representation Learning for Cold-start Content Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems. A common remedy is to use a content-based approach, but rich information from raw contents in various forms has not been fully utilized. In this paper, we propose a domain/data-agnostic item representation learning framework for cold-start recommendations, naturally equipped with multimodal alignment among various features by adopting a Transformer-based architecture. Our proposed model is end-to-end trainable completely free from classification labels, not just costly to collect but suboptimal for recommendation-purpose representation learning. From extensive experiments on real-world movie and news recommendation benchmarks, we verify that our approach better preserves fine-grained user taste than state-of-the-art baselines, universally applicable to multiple domains at large scale.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Sequence Denoising with Cross-Signal Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) aim to suggest next item for a user based on her historical interaction sequences. Recently, many research efforts have been devoted to attenuate the influence of noisy items in sequences by either assigning them with lower attention weights or discarding them directly. The major limitation of these methods is that the former would still prone to overfit noisy items while the latter may overlook informative items. To the end, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Multi-level Sequence Denoising with Cross-signal Contrastive Learning (MSDCCL) for sequential recommendation. To be specific, we first introduce a target-aware user interest extractor to simultaneously capture users' long and short term interest with the guidance of target items. Then, we develop a multi-level sequence denoising module to alleviate the impact of noisy items by employing both soft and hard signal denoising strategies. Additionally, we extend existing curriculum learning by simulating the learning pattern of human beings. It is worth noting that our proposed model can be seamlessly integrated with a majority of existing recommendation models and significantly boost their effectiveness. Experimental studies on five public datasets are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed MSDCCL is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/lalunex/MSDCCL/tree/main.</description>

      <title>SPLATE: Sparse Late Interaction Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late interaction paradigm introduced with ColBERT stands out in the neural Information Retrieval space, offering a compelling effectiveness-efficiency trade-off across many benchmarks. Efficient late interaction retrieval is based on an optimized multi-step strategy, where an approximate search first identifies a set of candidate documents to re-rank exactly. In this work, we introduce SPLATE, a simple and lightweight adaptation of the ColBERTv2 model which learns an ``MLM adapter'', mapping its frozen token embeddings to a sparse vocabulary space with a partially learned SPLADE module. This allows us to perform the candidate generation step in late interaction pipelines with traditional sparse retrieval techniques, making it particularly appealing for running ColBERT in CPU environments. Our SPLATE ColBERTv2 pipeline achieves the same effectiveness as the PLAID ColBERTv2 engine by re-ranking 50 documents that can be retrieved under 10ms.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Filtering Based on Diffusion Models: Unveiling the Potential of High-Order Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study has shown that diffusion models are well-suited for modeling the generative process of user-item interactions in recommender systems due to their denoising nature. However, existing diffusion model-based recommender systems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain crucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this gap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along with multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds random noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process accommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop autoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions. CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module, responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item interactions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and 2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order connectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b) Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the embeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original cross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that scales linearly with the number of users or items.</description>

      <title>Turbo-CF: Matrix Decomposition-Free Graph Filtering for Fast Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of graph filtering (GF)-based collaborative filtering (CF) showcases state-of-the-art performance on the recommendation accuracy by using a low-pass filter (LPF) without a training process. However, conventional GF-based CF approaches mostly perform matrix decomposition on the item-item similarity graph to realize the ideal LPF, which results in a non-trivial computational cost and thus makes them less practical in scenarios where rapid recommendations are essential. In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-based CF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CF employs a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrix decompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardware components (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-item similarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our own polynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals without explicit matrix decompositions. We demonstrate that Turbo-CF is extremely fast yet accurate, achieving a runtime of less than 1 second on real-world benchmark datasets while achieving recommendation accuracies comparable to best competitors.</description>

      <title>Development and Evaluation of Dental Image Exchange and Management System: A User-Centered Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Systems that exist in the hospital or clinic settings are capable of providing services in the physical environment. These systems (e.g., Picture Archiving and communication systems) provide remote service for patients. To design such systems, we need some unique methods such as software development life cycle and different methods such as prototyping. Clinical setting: This study designs an image exchange system in the private dental sector of Urmia city using user-centered methods and prototyping. Methods: Information was collected based on each stage's software development life cycle. Interviews and observations were used to gather user-needs data, such as object-oriented programming for developing a Prototype. Results: The users' needs were determined to consider at the beginning. Ease of use, security, and mobile apps were their most essential needs. Then, the prototype was designed and evaluated in the focus group session. These steps continued until users were satisfied in the focus group. Eventually, after the users' consent, the prototype became the final system. Discussion: Instant access to Information, volunteering, user interface design, and usefulness were the most critical variables users considered. The advantage of this system also includes less radiation to the patient due to not losing and missing the clips of the patient's images. Conclusion: The success of such a system requires the consideration of end-users needs and their application to the system. In addition to this system, having an electronic health record can improve the treatment process and improve the work of the medical staff.</description>

Abstract: In the composition process, selecting appropriate single-instrumental music sequences and assigning their track-role is an indispensable task. However, manually determining the track-role for a myriad of music samples can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study introduces a deep learning model designed to automatically predict the track-role of single-instrumental music sequences. Our evaluations show a prediction accuracy of 87% in the symbolic domain and 84% in the audio domain. The proposed track-role prediction methods hold promise for future applications in AI music generation and analysis.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Retrieval Quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) presents challenges, particularly for retrieval models within these systems. Traditional end-to-end evaluation methods are computationally expensive. Furthermore, evaluation of the retrieval model's performance based on query-document relevance labels shows a small correlation with the RAG system's downstream performance. We propose a novel evaluation approach, eRAG, where each document in the retrieval list is individually utilized by the large language model within the RAG system. The output generated for each document is then evaluated based on the downstream task ground truth labels. In this manner, the downstream performance for each document serves as its relevance label. We employ various downstream task metrics to obtain document-level annotations and aggregate them using set-based or ranking metrics. Extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets demonstrate that eRAG achieves a higher correlation with downstream RAG performance compared to baseline methods, with improvements in Kendall's $\tau$ correlation ranging from 0.168 to 0.494. Additionally, eRAG offers significant computational advantages, improving runtime and consuming up to 50 times less GPU memory than end-to-end evaluation.</description>

      <title>SHE-Net: Syntax-Hierarchy-Enhanced Text-Video Retrieval</title>

Abstract: The user base of short video apps has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, resulting in a significant demand for video content analysis. In particular, text-video retrieval, which aims to find the top matching videos given text descriptions from a vast video corpus, is an essential function, the primary challenge of which is to bridge the modality gap. Nevertheless, most existing approaches treat texts merely as discrete tokens and neglect their syntax structures. Moreover, the abundant spatial and temporal clues in videos are often underutilized due to the lack of interaction with text. To address these issues, we argue that using texts as guidance to focus on relevant temporal frames and spatial regions within videos is beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel Syntax-Hierarchy-Enhanced text-video retrieval method (SHE-Net) that exploits the inherent semantic and syntax hierarchy of texts to bridge the modality gap from two perspectives. First, to facilitate a more fine-grained integration of visual content, we employ the text syntax hierarchy, which reveals the grammatical structure of text descriptions, to guide the visual representations. Second, to further enhance the multi-modal interaction and alignment, we also utilize the syntax hierarchy to guide the similarity calculation. We evaluated our method on four public text-video retrieval datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. The experimental results and ablation studies confirm the advantages of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Recommender Systems in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>

Abstract: With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items. Then, we review recent techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss future directions in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>An Exploration Study of Mixed-initiative Query Reformulation in Conversational Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we report our methods and experiments for the TREC Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT) 2022. In this work, we aim to reproduce multi-stage retrieval pipelines and explore one of the potential benefits of involving mixed-initiative interaction in conversational passage retrieval scenarios: reformulating raw queries. Before the first ranking stage of a multi-stage retrieval pipeline, we propose a mixed-initiative query reformulation module, which achieves query reformulation based on the mixed-initiative interaction between the users and the system, as the replacement for the neural reformulation method. Specifically, we design an algorithm to generate appropriate questions related to the ambiguities in raw queries, and another algorithm to reformulate raw queries by parsing users' feedback and incorporating it into the raw query. For the first ranking stage of our multi-stage pipelines, we adopt a sparse ranking function: BM25, and a dense retrieval method: TCT-ColBERT. For the second-ranking step, we adopt a pointwise reranker: MonoT5, and a pairwise reranker: DuoT5. Experiments on both TREC CAsT 2021 and TREC CAsT 2022 datasets show the effectiveness of our mixed-initiative-based query reformulation method on improving retrieval performance compared with two popular reformulators: a neural reformulator: CANARD-T5 and a rule-based reformulator: historical query reformulator(HQE).</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph Context-Enhanced Diversified Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of Recommender Systems (RecSys) has been extensively studied to enhance accuracy by leveraging users' historical interactions. Nonetheless, this persistent pursuit of accuracy frequently engenders diminished diversity, culminating in the well-recognized "echo chamber" phenomenon. Diversified RecSys has emerged as a countermeasure, placing diversity on par with accuracy and garnering noteworthy attention from academic circles and industry practitioners. This research explores the realm of diversified RecSys within the intricate context of knowledge graphs (KG). These KGs act as repositories of interconnected information concerning entities and items, offering a propitious avenue to amplify recommendation diversity through the incorporation of insightful contextual information. Our contributions include introducing an innovative metric, Entity Coverage, and Relation Coverage, which effectively quantifies diversity within the KG domain. Additionally, we introduce the Diversified Embedding Learning (DEL) module, meticulously designed to formulate user representations that possess an innate awareness of diversity. In tandem with this, we introduce a novel technique named Conditional Alignment and Uniformity (CAU). It adeptly encodes KG item embeddings while preserving contextual integrity. Collectively, our contributions signify a substantial stride towards augmenting the panorama of recommendation diversity within the realm of KG-informed RecSys paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of information proliferation, discerning the credibility of news content poses an ever-growing challenge. This paper introduces RELIANCE, a pioneering ensemble learning system designed for robust information and fake news credibility evaluation. Comprising five diverse base models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs), RELIANCE employs an innovative approach to integrate their strengths, harnessing the collective intelligence of the ensemble for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of RELIANCE over individual models, indicating its efficacy in distinguishing between credible and non-credible information sources. RELIANCE, also surpasses baseline models in information and news credibility assessment, establishing itself as an effective solution for evaluating the reliability of information sources.</description>

      <title>Drop your Decoder: Pre-training with Bag-of-Word Prediction for Dense Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked auto-encoder pre-training has emerged as a prevalent technique for initializing and enhancing dense retrieval systems. It generally utilizes additional Transformer decoder blocks to provide sustainable supervision signals and compress contextual information into dense representations. However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of such a pre-training technique remain unclear. The usage of additional Transformer-based decoders also incurs significant computational costs. In this study, we aim to shed light on this issue by revealing that masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training with enhanced decoding significantly improves the term coverage of input tokens in dense representations, compared to vanilla BERT checkpoints. Building upon this observation, we propose a modification to the traditional MAE by replacing the decoder of a masked auto-encoder with a completely simplified Bag-of-Word prediction task. This modification enables the efficient compression of lexical signals into dense representations through unsupervised pre-training. Remarkably, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on several large-scale retrieval benchmarks without requiring any additional parameters, which provides a 67% training speed-up compared to standard masked auto-encoder pre-training with enhanced decoding.</description>

      <title>DGR: A General Graph Desmoothing Framework for Recommendation via Global and Local Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become pivotal in recommendation systems for learning user and item embeddings by leveraging the user-item interaction graph's node information and topology. However, these models often face the famous over-smoothing issue, leading to indistinct user and item embeddings and reduced personalization. Traditional desmoothing methods in GCN-based systems are model-specific, lacking a universal solution. This paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic approach named \textbf{D}esmoothing Framework for \textbf{G}CN-based \textbf{R}ecommendation Systems (\textbf{DGR}). It effectively addresses over-smoothing on general GCN-based recommendation models by considering both global and local perspectives. Specifically, we first introduce vector perturbations during each message passing layer to penalize the tendency of node embeddings approximating overly to be similar with the guidance of the global topological structure. Meanwhile, we further develop a tailored-design loss term for the readout embeddings to preserve the local collaborative relations between users and their neighboring items. In particular, items that exhibit a high correlation with neighboring items are also incorporated to enhance the local topological information. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets based on 5 well-known GCN-based recommendation models, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>C-Pack: Packaged Resources To Advance General Chinese Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce C-Pack, a package of resources that significantly advance the field of general Chinese embeddings. C-Pack includes three critical resources. 1) C-MTEB is a comprehensive benchmark for Chinese text embeddings covering 6 tasks and 35 datasets. 2) C-MTP is a massive text embedding dataset curated from labeled and unlabeled Chinese corpora for training embedding models. 3) C-TEM is a family of embedding models covering multiple sizes. Our models outperform all prior Chinese text embeddings on C-MTEB by up to +10% upon the time of the release. We also integrate and optimize the entire suite of training methods for C-TEM. Along with our resources on general Chinese embedding, we release our data and models for English text embeddings. The English models achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB benchmark; meanwhile, our released English data is 2 times larger than the Chinese data. All these resources are made publicly available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.</description>

      <title>CorpusLM: Towards a Unified Language Model on Corpus for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in various fields but prone to hallucination, especially in knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks. To address this, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to enhance factual accuracy. However, traditional retrieval modules often rely on large document index and disconnect with generative tasks. With the advent of generative retrieval (GR), language models can retrieve by directly generating document identifiers (DocIDs), offering superior performance in retrieval tasks. However, the potential relationship between GR and downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CorpusLM}, a unified language model that leverages external corpus to tackle various knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating generative retrieval, closed-book generation, and RAG through a unified greedy decoding process. We design the following mechanisms to facilitate effective retrieval and generation, and improve the end-to-end effectiveness of KI tasks: (1) We develop a ranking-oriented DocID list generation strategy, which refines GR by directly learning from a DocID ranking list, to improve retrieval quality. (2) We design a continuous DocIDs-References-Answer generation strategy, which facilitates effective and efficient RAG. (3) We employ well-designed unsupervised DocID understanding tasks, to comprehend DocID semantics and their relevance to downstream tasks. We evaluate our approach on the widely used KILT benchmark with two variants of backbone models, i.e., T5 and Llama2. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our models in both retrieval and downstream tasks.</description>

Abstract: Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints, in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing writing assistants for personalization and individuality.</description>

      <title>Single-Server Pliable Private Information Retrieval with Identifiable Side Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Pliable Private Information Retrieval (PPIR) with a single server, messages are partitioned into $\Gamma$ non-overlapping classes. The user wants to retrieve a message from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class to the server. In S. A. Obead, H. Y. Lin and E. Rosnes, Single-Server Pliable Private Information Retrieval With Side Information, arXiv:2305.06857, authors consider the problem of PPIR with Side Information (PPIR-SI), where the user now has side information. The user wants to retrieve any new message (not included in the side information) from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class and its side information. A scheme for the PPIR-SI is given by Obead et al. for the case when the users side information is unidentified, and this case is referred to as PPIR with Unidentifiable SI (PPIR-USI). In this paper, we study the problem of PPIR for the single server case when the side information is partially identifiable, and we term this case as PPIR with Identifiable Side Information (PPIR-ISI). The user is well aware of the identity of the side information belonging to $\eta$ number of classes, where $1\leq \eta \leq \Gamma$. In this problem, The user wants to retrieve a message from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class to the server. We give a scheme for PPIR-ISI, and we prove that having identifiable side information is advantageous by comparing the rate of the proposed scheme to the rate of the PPIR-USI scheme given by Obead et al. for some cases. Further, we extend the problem of PPIR-ISI for multi-user case, where users can collaborately generate the query sets, and we give a scheme for this problem.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Question Answering for Enterprise Knowledge Bases using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient knowledge management plays a pivotal role in augmenting both the operational efficiency and the innovative capacity of businesses and organizations. By indexing knowledge through vectorization, a variety of knowledge retrieval methods have emerged, significantly enhancing the efficacy of knowledge management systems. Recently, the rapid advancements in generative natural language processing technologies paved the way for generating precise and coherent answers after retrieving relevant documents tailored to user queries. However, for enterprise knowledge bases, assembling extensive training data from scratch for knowledge retrieval and generation is a formidable challenge due to the privacy and security policies of private data, frequently entailing substantial costs. To address the challenge above, in this paper, we propose EKRG, a novel Retrieval-Generation framework based on large language models (LLMs), expertly designed to enable question-answering for Enterprise Knowledge bases with limited annotation costs. Specifically, for the retrieval process, we first introduce an instruction-tuning method using an LLM to generate sufficient document-question pairs for training a knowledge retriever. This method, through carefully designed instructions, efficiently generates diverse questions for enterprise knowledge bases, encompassing both fact-oriented and solution-oriented knowledge. Additionally, we develop a relevance-aware teacher-student learning strategy to further enhance the efficiency of the training process. For the generation process, we propose a novel chain of thought (CoT) based fine-tuning method to empower the LLM-based generator to adeptly respond to user questions using retrieved documents. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description>
