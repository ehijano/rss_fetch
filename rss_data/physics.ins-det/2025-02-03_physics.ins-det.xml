      <title>Ion Transport on Phased Radiofrequency Carpets in Xenon Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and performance of a four-phased radiofrequency (RF) carpet system for ion transport in high-pressure xenon gas. The RF carpet, designed with a 160 $\mu$m pitch, is applied to the lateral collection of ions in xenon at pressures up to 600 mbar. We demonstrate transport efficiency of caesium ions across varying pressures, and compare with microscopic simulations made in the SIMION package. The novel use of an N-phased RF carpet at high pressure can achieve ion levitation and controlled lateral motion in a denser environment than is typical for RF ion transport in gases. This feature makes such carpets strong candidates for ion transport to single ion sensors envisaged for future neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments in xenon gas.</description>

      <title>The development of IBIC microscopy at the 100 kV ion implanter of the University of Torino (LIUTo) and the application for the assessment of the radiation hardness of a silicon photodiode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) technique is widely used to characterize the electronic properties of semiconductor materials and devices. Its main advantage over other charge collection microscopies stems in the use of MeV ion probes, which provide both measurable induced charge signals from single ions, and high spatial resolution, which is maintained along the ion range. It is a fact, however, that the use of low-energy ions in the keV range can provide the IBIC technique with complementary analytical capabilities, that are not available with MeV ions, for example the higher sensitivity to the status, contamination and morphology of the surface and the fact that the induced signal depends on the transport of only one type of charge carrier. This paper outlines the upgrade that was made at the 100 kV ion implanter of the University of Torino, originally installed for material and surface modification, to explore the rather unexplored keV-IBIC field and to assess its potential to characterize semiconductor devices. Finally, we report the first IBIC application of our apparatus, which regards the assessment of the radiation damage of a commercially available silicon photodiode, adopting the IAEA experimental protocol and the relevant interpretative model.</description>

      <title>Methods for the study of light propagation in LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) are widely used in particle physics experiments. They use light and charge released in events to reconstruct and analyze them. Light information collected by the Photon Detection System (PDS) is used mainly to determine the initial time stamp, $t_0$, and to support determining the total energy of the event. For these purposes, it is important to simulate and predict the propagation of light inside the detector. There are several approaches to this, and this work discusses some of the options.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an optical cavity containing a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We successfully stabilized a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity incorporating a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator with the pulse-tube cryocooler running. In stark contrast to previous demonstrations where lasers were locked to the cavities, our setup locks the cavity to a laser. Our measurements of cavity length fluctuation suggest that the setup could stabilize a cavity up to a finesse of $1.2\times 10^4$ without the diamond and $5.8 \times10^3$ with the diamond crystal. The finesse with a diamond crystal of approximately 90 is primarily limited by the absorption loss inside the diamond.</description>

      <title>Assessing Sensitivity of Brain-to-Scalp Blood Flows in Laser Speckle Imaging by Occluding the Superficial Temporal Artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerebral blood flow is a critical metric for cerebrovascular monitoring, with applications in stroke detection, brain injury evaluation, aging, and neurological disorders. Non-invasively measuring cerebral blood dynamics is challenging due to the scalp and skull, which obstruct direct brain access and contain their own blood dynamics that must be isolated. We developed an aggregated seven-channel speckle contrast optical spectroscopy system to measure blood flow and blood volume non-invasively. Each channel, with distinct source-to-detector distance, targeted different depths to detect scalp and brain blood dynamics separately. By briefly occluding the superficial temporal artery, which supplies blood only to the scalp, we isolated surface blood dynamics from brain signals. Results on 20 subjects show that scalp-sensitive channels experienced significant reductions in blood dynamics during occlusion, while brain-sensitive channels experienced minimal changes. This provides experimental evidence of brain-to-scalp sensitivity in optical measurements, highlighting optimal configuration for preferentially probing brain signals non-invasively.</description>

      <title>The DESY Digital Silicon Photomultiplier: Device Characteristics and First Test-Beam Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are state-of-the-art photon detectors used in particle physics, medical imaging, and beyond. They are sensitive to individual photons in the optical wavelength regime and achieve time resolutions of a few tens of picoseconds, which makes them interesting candidates for timing detectors in tracking systems for particle physics experiments. The Geiger discharges triggered in the sensitive elements of a SiPM, Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs), yield signal amplitudes independent of the energy deposited by a photon or ionizing particle. This intrinsically digital nature of the signal motivates its digitization already on SPAD level.
  A digital SiPM (dSiPM) was designed at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), combining a SPAD array with embedded CMOS circuitry for on-chip signal processing. A key feature of the DESY dSiPM is its capability to provide hit-position information on pixel level, and one hit time stamp per quadrant at a 3 MHz readout-frame rate. The pixels comprise four SPADs and have a pitch of about 70 um. The four time stamps are provided by 12 bit Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) with a resolution better than 100 ps.
  The chip was characterized in the laboratory to determine dark count rate, breakdown voltage, and TDC characteristics. Test-beam measurements are analyzed to assess the DESY dSiPMs performance in the context of a 4D-tracking applications. The results demonstrate a spatial hit resolution on a pixel level, a minimum-ionizing particle detection efficiency of about 30 % and a time resolution in the order of 50 ps.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shape Discrimination in JSNS$^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JSNS$^2$ (J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) is an experiment that is searching for sterile neutrinos via the observation of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e$ appearance oscillations using neutrinos with muon decay-at-rest. For this search, rejecting cosmic-ray-induced neutron events by Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) is essential because the JSNS$^2$ detector is located above ground, on the third floor of the building. We have achieved 95$\%$ rejection of neutron events while keeping 90$\%$ of signal, electron-like events using a data driven likelihood method.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive Argon Concentration Assessment within Insulating Glass Units (IGUs) using Ultrasonic Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insulating glass units (IGUs) contribute significantly to energy loss among building envelopes, as they are responsible for approximately 30 to 50% of thermal transmission losses. To mitigate these losses, inert gases such as Argon are used within IGU spacers. The aging of IGUs cause decrease in Argon gas concentration, affecting their insulating properties. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the Argon concentration to maintain the insulating effectiveness of IGUs. Therefore, this study focuses on utilizing ultrasonic testing (UT) to develop a non-destructive and affordable methodology for assessing argon concentration within IGUs. The methodology is developed in four steps: (1) designing an experimental setup for creating accurate gas mixtures of Argon and air, and transferring the target gas mixtures to the IGU spacer; (2) performing ultrasonic tests on IGUs with 60kHz excitation frequency to generate UT waveforms; (3) performing a validation test of the proposed methodology to verify the accuracy and repeatability of results obtained from step 2; and (4) analyzing the ultrasonic waveforms to explore the correlation between UT properties and Argon concentration within IGU. The findings show that ultrasonic energy serves as the most effective UT feature for assessing Argon concentration within the IGU spacer, as evidenced by a strong correlation with an R-squared value exceeding 0.9 across all the UT measurements. This research introduces a user-friendly solution that enhances the ease of assessing Argon concentration within IGUs' spacers, thereby facilitating the monitoring of their operational performance. The proposed methodology for evaluating Argon concentration holds potential benefits for IGU manufacturers and researchers. Moreover, it serves as a valuable tool for improving quality control across the manufacturing, maintenance, and operational stages of IGUs.</description>

      <title>Potential of RES-NOVA as Dark Matter observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RES-NOVA project is an experimental initiative aimed at detecting neutrinos from the next galactic supernova using PbWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors, operated at low temperatures in a low-background environment. By utilizing archaeological lead (Pb) as the target material, RES-NOVA leverages its high radiopurity, large nuclear mass, and the natural abundance of $^{207}$Pb, making it well-suited for exploring both spin-independent and spin-dependent Dark Matter (DM) interactions via nuclear scattering. This work presents a background model developed for the RES-NOVA technology demonstrator and evaluates its implications for Dark Matter detection. Detailed calculations of nuclear matrix elements, combined with the unique properties of archaeological Pb, demonstrate RES-NOVA's potential as a complementary tool to existing direct detection experiments for studying Dark Matter interactions. The experiment will conduct DM searches over a broad mass range spanning 4 orders of magnitude, from sub-GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$. In the most optimistic scenario, RES-NOVA is expected to probe DM-nucleon cross-sections down to 1$\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ and 2$\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for candidates with masses of 2 GeV/$c^2$ and 20 GeV/$c^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>LET measurements and simulation modelling of the charged particle field for the Clatterbridge ocular proton therapy beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton therapy can achieve a highly targeted treatment by utilising the advantageous dosimetric characteristics of the Bragg Peak. Protons traversing through a material will deposit their maximum energy at the Bragg Peak through ionisation and other interactions, transferring minimal excess dose to surrounding tissue and organs. This rate of energy loss is also quantified by the linear energy transfer (LET), which is indicative of radiation quality and radiobiological effects. However it is a challenging physical quantity to measure, as characterisation of radiation fields and the impact of LET on treatment requires advanced tools and technology. The MiniPIX-Timepix is a miniaturised, hybrid semiconductor pixel detector capable of high resolution spectrometric tracking, enabling wide-range detection of the deposited energy, position and direction of single particles. Experimental measurements were performed at a clinical facility, the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre which houses a 60 MeV ocular proton therapy beamline. A realistic end-to-end model of the facility was developed in the Monte Carlo code TOPAS (TOol for PArticle Simulation) and was used to simulate the experimental conditions. The detector was held at 45$^{\circ}$ and 60$^{\circ}$ perpendicular to the beam, and placed downstream of various thickness Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blocks to acquire data along the dose deposition depth. Empirical cluster data providing track length and the energy deposition distributions were used to obtain the LET spectra. The determined values for the LET in silicon and dose averaged LET across the BP show general agreement with simulated results, supporting the applicability of the TOPAS CCC model. This work explores the capability of the MiniPIX detector to measure physical quantities to resolve the LET, and discusses experimental considerations and further possibilities.</description>
