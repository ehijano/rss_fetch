      <title>Terrorism &amp; Democracy in Burkina-Faso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the political consequences of terrorism in Burkina Faso. Using a dataset combining geolocated terrorist events from ACLED (from 2015 to 2024) with public opinion data from Afrobarometer, I compare the effect of successful terrorist attacks on public support for democracy and authoritarian alternatives. The results reveal that successful terrorist attacks significantly increase support for military regimes, one man regimes, and one party systems, while decreasing support for democratic governance. These changes are most pronounced immediately after the attacks and persist over time. This suggests that terrorism has triggered a trade-off in public preferences between security and freedom. The study also reveals that terrorism erodes perceptions of key democratic values, particularly civil liberties and freedom of movement. Robustness tests confirm that weak institutions or a lack of political knowledge are not driving the results. The article highlights how terrorism in fragile democracies can undermine democratic resilience and accelerate authoritarian drift.</description>

      <title>What influenced the lack of diversity in CSR after the company's losses: evidence from topic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diversity of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure is a crucial dimension of corporate transparency, reflecting the breadth and resilience of a firm's social responsibility. Using CSR reports of Chinese A-share firms from 2006 to 2023, this paper applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics and quantifies disclosure diversity using the Gini-Simpson index and Shannon entropy. Regression results show that corporate losses significantly compress CSR topic diversity, consistent with the slack resources hypothesis. Both external and internal governance mechanisms mitigate this effect: higher media attention, stronger executive compensation incentives, and greater supervisory board shareholding attenuate the loss-diversity penalty. Results are robust to instrumental variables estimation, propensity score matching, and placebo tests. Heterogeneity analyses indicate weaker effects in firms with third-party assurance, those disclosing work safety content, large firms, and those in less competitive industries. Our study highlights the structural impact of financial distress on non-financial disclosure and provides practical implications for optimizing CSR communication, refining evaluation frameworks for rating agencies, and designing diversified disclosure standards.</description>

      <title>When Clear Skies Cloud Trust: Environmental Cues and the Paradox of Confidence in Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Government trust, as a core concept in political economy and public policy research, serves as a fundamental cornerstone of democratic legitimacy and state capacity. This paper examines how environmental conditions, particularly sunlight efficiency, influence reported government trust through both affective and cognitive mechanisms. Leveraging World Values Survey Wave 7 data merged with NASA POWER high-frequency weather data, we propose and validate a novel ``salience and attribution'' mechanism: clearer skies may paradoxically reduce government trust by heightening environmental awareness and triggering negative attributions. We further identify potential mediating pathways, including subjective well-being, political interest, political discussion, and health perception, and demonstrate that environmental conditions introduce measurement error in survey-based trust indicators. Our findings provide theoretical contributions to environmental psychology, behavioral political economy, and survey methodology, and yield practical implications for governance, policy design, and survey</description>

      <title>Unintended Consequences of Early Driving Access: Evidence from Graduated Driver Licensing Policies and Adolescent Health Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graduated driver licensing systems effectively reduce adolescent traffic fatalities but create unintended health consequences. Using state-level variation in licensing policies from 1999-2020 and difference-in-differences analysis, we provide the first causal evidence that early driving access generates significant health risks for female adolescents aged 15-19. States allowing learner's permits before age 16 experienced sharp increases in drug-related mortality (+1.331 per 100,000, p&lt;0.001) and mental health-related mortality (+0.760, p&lt;0.001), even as vehicle deaths declined (-0.656, p&lt;0.05). These effects explain nearly one-third of rising adolescent drug mortality and one-tenth of mental health mortality increases over the study period. Early driving access expands geographic reach, enabling contact with illicit drug markets previously inaccessible to adolescents. It broadens social networks, increasing exposure to high-risk peers, while vehicles provide unsupervised spaces for experimentation. Premature independence also intensifies psychological stress during critical developmental stages. Nationally, results correspond to approximately 138 additional drug deaths and 79 mental health deaths annually among female adolescents, imposing over $2 billion in mortality costs yearly. These findings fundamentally reshape cost-benefit assessments of licensing policies, revealing how interventions protecting adolescents in one domain can create risks in others. Evidence-based modifications including enhanced supervision, geographic restrictions, and mental health integration could preserve traffic safety gains while mitigating unintended harms. This research demonstrates the critical need for multi-outcome policy evaluation that captures both benefits and hidden costs of expanded adolescent independence.</description>

      <title>Moravec's Paradox and Restrepo's Model: Limits of AGI Automation in Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note extends Restrepo (2025)'s model of economic growth under AGI by incorporating Moravec's Paradox -the observation that tasks requiring sensorimotor skills remain computationally expensive relative to cognitive tasks. We partition the task space into cognitive and physical components with differential automation costs, allowing infinite costs for some physical bottlenecks. Our key result shows that when physical tasks constitute economic bottlenecks with sufficiently high (or infinite) computational requirements, the labor share of income converges to a positive constant in the finite-compute regime (rather than zero). This fundamentally alters the distributional implications of AGI while preserving the growth dynamics for cognitive-intensive economies.</description>

      <title>Identifying the post-pandemic determinants of low performing students in Latin America through interpretable Machine Learning SHAP Values-Insights from PISA 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high prevalence of students not achieving the basic competencies in Latin America is concerning. Even more so given the region's deep structural inequalities and the larger post-pandemic regional learning losses. Within this scenario, this paper contributes to the identification of the determinants of bottom and low performers (below level 2) using recent advancements on explainable machine learning methods. In particular, relying on PISA 2022 data for 10 countries and using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, I identify critical factors impacting on the student performance across low performers groups. I find that a student with the highest probability of being a not achiever speaks a minority language and had repeated, has no digital devices at home, comes from a poor family and works for payment half of the week, and the school he/she attends has wide disadvantages such as bad school climate, weak ICT infrastructure and poor teaching quality (only a third of teachers being certified). Regarding countries' estimates, I find quite homogeneous patterns as far as global average contribution of top ranked factors is concerned, with repetition at primary, household wealth, and educational ICT inputs being top ten ranked covariates in at least 8 out of the 10 total countries. The paper findings contribute to the broad literature on strategies to identify and to target those most left behind in Latin American education systems.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Latin American students academic resilience-Insights based on PISA 2022 using an explainable machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The learning crisis in the Latin American region (i.e., higher rates of students not reaching basic competencies at secondary level) is worrying, particularly post-pandemic given the stronger role of inequality behind achievement. Within this scenario, the concept of student academic resilience (SAR), students who despite coming from disadvantaged backgrounds reach good performance levels, and an analysis of its determinants, are policy relevant. In this paper, using advancements on explainable machine learning methods (the SHAP method) and relying on PISA 2022 data for 9 countries from the region, I identify leading factors behind SAR using diverse indicators. I find that household inputs (books and digital devices), gender, homework, repetition and work intensity are leading factors for one indicator of academic resilience, whereas for other indicator leading drives fall into the school domain: school size, the ratio of PC connected to the internet, STR and teaching quality proxied by certified teachers and professional development rates and school type (private school). Also, I find negative associations of SAR with the length of school closures and barriers for remote learning during the pandemic. The paper's findings adds to the scare regional literature as well as they contribute to future policy designs where key features behind SAR can be used to lift disadvantaged students from lower achievement groups towards being academic resilient.</description>

      <title>Pixels to Prices: Visual Traits, Market Cycles, and the Economics of NFT Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how visual traits and market cycles shape prices in NFT markets. Using 94,039 transactions from 26 major generative Ethereum collections, the analysis extracts 196 machine-quantified image features (covering color, composition, palette structure, geometry, texture, and deep learning embeddings), then applies a three-stage filter process to identify stable predictors for hedonic regression. A static mixed-effects model shows that market sentiment and transparent, interpretable image traits have significant and independent pricing power: higher focal saturation, compositional concentration, and curvature are rewarded, while clutter, heavy line work, and dispersed palettes are discounted; deep embeddings add limited incremental value conditional on explicit traits. To assess state dependence, the study estimates a Bayesian dynamic mixed-effects panel with cycle effects and time-varying coefficients for a salient image attribute (Composition Focus - Saturation). Collection-level heterogeneity ("brand premia") is absorbed by random effects. The time-varying coefficients exhibit regime sensitivity, with stronger premia in expansionary phases and weaker or negative loadings in downturns, while grand-mean effects remain small on average. Overall, NFT prices reflect both observable digital product characteristics and market regimes, and the framework offers a cycle-aware tool for asset pricing, platform strategy, and market design in digital art markets.</description>

      <title>Signaling in the Age of AI: Evidence from Cover Letters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how generative AI affects labor market signaling using the introduction of an AI-powered cover letter writing tool on Freelancer.com. Our data track both access to the tool and usage at the application level. Difference-in-differences estimates show that access to the AI tool increased textual alignment between cover letters and job posts--which we refer to as cover letter tailoring--and raised callback likelihoods. Workers with weaker pre-AI writing skills saw larger improvements in cover letters, indicating that AI substitutes for workers' own skills. Although only a minority of applications used the tool, the overall correlation between cover letter tailoring and callbacks fell by 51%, implying that cover letters became less informative signals of worker ability in the age of AI. Employers correspondingly shifted toward alternative signals, such as workers' past reviews, which became more predictive of hiring. Finally, within the treated group, greater time spent editing AI drafts was associated with higher hiring success.</description>

      <title>Labour unions under neoliberal authoritarianism in the Global South: the cases of Turkey and Egypt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyses the trajectories of organised labour in times of neoliberalism in Turkey and Egypt and their current condition under securitised neoliberal-developmentalist regimes post-2013. Neoliberal experience in these countries was marked by continuing authoritarianism, challenging the view that economic liberalisation would lead to political democratisation. One of the most important areas of neoliberal restructuring has been labour markets. In order to achieve this, struggles over organised labour were of vital importance. Dismantling the power of dissident labour unions through coercive measures and containing other sections of organised labour through authoritarian corporatist relations has been crucial in these cases.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Multi-Level Pricing Schemes in the Context of eCW Client Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a usage-based pricing framework for the Intelligent Medical Objects ProblemIT Portal utilized by eClinicalWorks (eCW) clients. The approach begins by determining a stable monthly unit price per request, estimated as the median from semi-parametric Bayesian cubic smoothing spline analyses covering the period November 2015 to December 2016. Clients are subsequently segmented into eight volume-based tiers, with total charges computed by multiplying the derived median unit price by each client's total request count. Examination of the dataset reveals that 806 accounts with a single registered user and 470 accounts with two registered users both exhibit disproportionately high request volumes. The proposed model incorporates adjustments to account for these anomalies.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quasi-Experimental and Structural Approaches for Robust Evaluation of US Airline Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15785v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We bridge quasi-experimental and structural approaches to develop a robust method for retrospective merger evaluation. First, we show that the standard difference-in-differences estimation equation can be interpreted as a "reduced form" of our structural equations, formally $\textit{bridging}$ these methodologies. Demand and cost parameters enable the construction of a robust measure of the merger price effect that remains identified even when the difference-in-differences approach is not, and can be decomposed into efficiency gains versus conduct changes among the remaining firms. Second, we enhance the structural approach by weighting each market's contribution to the moment conditions using market- and time-specific synthetic weights when the number of treated markets is limited. Applying this methodology to three major airline mergers, we find that modest efficiency gains are entirely offset by increased coordination, particularly in later mergers. The $\textit{synthetic GMM}$ refinement sharpens these findings, uncovering anti-competitive effects that standard approaches miss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity equations are often used to evaluate counterfactual trade policy scenarios, such as the effect of regional trade agreements on trade flows. In this paper, we argue that the suitability of gravity equations for this purpose crucially depends on their out-of-sample predictive power. We propose a methodology that compares different versions of the gravity equation, both among themselves and with machine learning-based forecast methods such as random forests and neural networks. We find that the 3-way gravity model is difficult to beat in terms of out-of-sample average predictive performance, especially if a flexible specification is used. This result further justifies its place as the predominant tool for applied trade policy analysis. However, when the goal is to predict individual bilateral trade flows, the 3-way model can be outperformed by an ensemble machine learning method.</description>

      <title>Pattern Recognition of Illicit E-Waste Misclassification in Global Trade Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global trade in electronic and electrical goods is complicated by the challenge of identifying e-waste, which is often misclassified to evade regulations. Traditional analysis methods struggle to discern the underlying patterns of this illicit trade within vast datasets. This research proposes and validates a robust, data-driven framework to segment products and identify goods exhibiting an anomalous "waste signature" a trade pattern defined by a clear 'inverse price-volume'. The core of the framework is an Outlier-Aware Segmentation method, an iterative K-Means approach that first isolates extreme outliers to prevent data skewing and then re-clusters the remaining products to reveal subtle market segments. To quantify risk, a "Waste Score" is developed using a Logistic Regression model that identifies products whose trade signatures are statistically similar to scrap. The findings reveal a consistent four-tier market hierarchy in both Malaysian and global datasets. A key pattern emerged from a comparative analysis: Malaysia's market structure is defined by high-volume bulk commodities, whereas the global market is shaped by high-value capital goods, indicating a unique national specialization. The framework successfully flags finished goods, such as electric generators (HS 8502), that are traded like scrap, providing a targeted list for regulatory scrutiny.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>
