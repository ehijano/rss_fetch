      <title>Quantum vortex dipole as a probe of the normal component distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of quantum vortex dipoles in a strongly interacting, spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid at zero temperature. Using fully microscopic time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that the dipole trajectory is strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of spin polarization. The resulting forces on the vortices include both longitudinal (dissipative) and transverse components, leading to deflection and shrinking of the dipole during propagation. For moderate polarization, vortex dipoles are deflected and lose energy, while for larger imbalances, they are rapidly annihilated. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spin-imbalanced Fermi gases contain a spatially nonuniform normal component even at zero temperature. We show that vortex dipoles serve as sensitive probes of this component, offering a route to indirectly detect exotic superfluid phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and related inhomogeneous condensates.</description>

      <title>Oscillation-Induced Frequency Generation in 1D Quantum Droplets under Harmonic-Gaussian Confinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamical behavior of one-dimensional quantum droplets (QDs) governed by the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, under harmonic confinement supplemented by a static or time-dependent Gaussian spike (Gs) potential. Employing both variational analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the root-mean-square (RMS) size, excitation spectrum, and phase-space dynamics of QDs. Our study reveals that while the harmonic trap sets the primary confinement, the Gs potential enables precise frequency tuning and control over droplet oscillations. A static Gs amplitude modifies the fundamental oscillation frequency depending on its sign, while a time-modulated Gs induces nonlinear dynamics, including higher harmonics and frequency mixing. Our analysis reveals that the resulting frequency spectrum is strongly influenced by inter- and intra-species interactions as well as by the parameters of the external trap. Notably, we establish a relationship between the frequency shift and the amplitude of the Gaussian spike. Wigner phase-space analysis further uncovers coherent rotational behavior, offering insights into hidden phase dynamics not apparent in real-space density profiles.</description>

      <title>Universal Long-Time Behavior of the Quantum Fisher Information in Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in quantum systems that possess well-defined classical limits, focusing on the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. We diagnose the DQPTs with the long-time average of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) showing that it abruptly changes at the transition point. Using mean-field and semiclassical approximations, we demonstrate that the long-time average of the QFI reveals universal behavior that persists across different systems.</description>

      <title>A Hydrodynamic Theory for Non-Equilibrium Full Counting Statistics in One-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of charge fluctuations after homogeneous quantum quenches in one-dimensional systems with ballistic transport. For short but macroscopic times where the non-trivial dynamics is largely dominated by long-range correlations, a simple expression for the associated full counting statistics can be obtained by hydrodynamic arguments. This formula links the non-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the associated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the original quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol. Under certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed by explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify precise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic theory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such conditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We discuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where calculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results. In physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the hydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first cumulants.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer State Representation and Pairing in the Fermionic Tonks-Girardeau Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative expression for the ground state wave function of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. Our wave function is constructed based on the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix. We demonstrate that the newly found wave function describes the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas under any external potential. By expressing the proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit expressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the suitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. With this, we prove and show how to detect that the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits non-trivial quantum correlations but is also a paired state.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model for broad range of strongly correlated phases, particularly the high-Tc superconductor. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Covariant Many-Body Theory I: Perturbative Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.09759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking considerations play an important role in allowing reliable and accurate predictions of complex systems in quantum many-body simulations. The general theory of perturbations in symmetry-breaking phases is nonetheless intrinsically more involved than in the unbroken phase due to non-vanishing anomalous Green's functions or anomalous quasiparticle interactions. In the present paper, we develop a formulation of many-body theory at non-zero temperature which is explicitly covariant with respect to a group containing Bogoliubov transformations. Based on the concept of Nambu tensors, we derive a factorisation of standard Feynman diagrams that is valid for a general Hamiltonian. The resulting factorised amplitudes are indexed over the set of un-oriented Feynman diagrams with fully antisymmetric vertices. We argue that, within this framework, the design of symmetry-breaking many-body approximations is simplified.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Covariant Many-Body Theory II: Self-Consistent Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.09763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Self-Consistent Green's Function (SCGF) is reformulated in an explicit Nambu-covariant fashion for applications to many-body systems at non-zero temperature in symmetry-broken phases. This is achieved by extending the Nambu-covariant formulation of perturbation theory, presented in the first part of this work, to non-perturbative schemes based on self-consistently dressed propagators and vertices. We work out in detail the self-consistent ladder approximation, motivated by a trade-off between numerical complexity and many-body phenomenology. Taking a complex general Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) propagator as a starting point, we also formulate and prove a sufficient condition on the stability of the HFB self-energy to ensure the convergence of the initial series of ladders at any energy. The self-consistent ladder approximation is written purely in terms of spectral functions and the resulting set of equations, when expressed in terms of Nambu tensors, are remarkably similar to those in the symmetry-conserving case. This puts the application of the self-consistent ladder approximation to symmetry-broken phases of infinite nuclear matter within reach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we propose to simulate quantum mechanical supersymmetric model and realize quantum mechanical SUSY in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>A high optical access cryogenic system for Rydberg atom arrays with a 3000-second trap lifetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a &lt;50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.</description>

      <title>Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</description>
