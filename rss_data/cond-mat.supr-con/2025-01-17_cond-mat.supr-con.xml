      <title>Absence of diode effect in chiral type-I superconductor NbGe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry elegantly governs the fundamental properties and derived functionalities of condensed matter. For instance, realizing the superconducting diode effect (SDE) demands breaking space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries simultaneously. Although the SDE is widely observed in various platforms, its underlying mechanism remains debated, particularly regarding the role of vortices. Here, we systematically investigate the nonreciprocal transport in the chiral type-I superconductor NbGe2. Moreover, we induce type-II superconductivity with elevated superconducting critical temperature on the artificial surface by focused ion beam irradiation, enabling control over vortex dynamics in NbGe2 devices. Strikingly, we observe negligible diode efficiency (Q &lt; 2%) at low magnetic fields, which rises significantly to Q ~ 50% at high magnetic fields, coinciding with an abrupt increase in vortex creep rate when the superconductivity of NbGe2 bulk is suppressed. These results unambiguously highlight the critical role of vortex dynamics in the SDE, in addition to the established symmetry rules.</description>

      <title>Photoemission evidence for multi-orbital hole-doping in superconducting La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and SrLaAlO$_4$ substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>AR-SFQ: Asynchronous Reset Library Using {\alpha}-Cell Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) circuits are the most evolved superconductor logic family. However, the need to clock each cell and the deep pipeline causes a complex clock network with a large skew. This results in lower throughput and high latency in RSFQ. This work introduces an asynchronous RSFQ cell library that incorporates the {\alpha}-cell, enabling bidirectional signal paths in RSFQ circuits. The {\alpha}-cell mitigates the need for a large clock network by allowing reverse signal flow, minimizing routing, and enabling compact circuit designs. We demonstrate the library's reliability and efficiency by analog simulations and using in-house optimization tools. The asynchronous reset RSFQ (AR-SFQ) will enable efficient implementation of scalable, high-performance computing frameworks, such as state machines, neuromorphic computing, and higher fan-in circuits.</description>

      <title>Weak electronic correlations in the cobalt oxychalcogenide superconductor Na2CoSe2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the newly discovered Co-based superconductor Na2CoSe2O, we performed systematic calculations of its electronic band structures using the density functional theory (DFT) plus the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approaches. Our comparative studies reveal weakly correlated and itinerant nature of the Co-3d electrons and show no sign of fluctuating local moments as expected in many other unconventional superconductors, although the Co eg orbitals are close to half filling. These suggest that Na2CoSe2O is a normal paramagnetic metal and its superconductivity might not be of strongly correlated nature, contrary to the initial speculation. We suggest future investigations of electron-phonon interactions to clarify its pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hybridization between surface flat bands and bulk bands in the topological nodal-line semimetal Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$ probed via soft-point-contact spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed study of soft-point-contact spectroscopy of the superconducting topological nodal-line semimetal Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$ with the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}=9.5$ K. In the normal state, we observe prominent asymmetric double peaks in the differential conductance $dI/dV$. The asymmetric $dI/dV$ curves are attributed to Fano resonance, quantum interference between two distinct tunneling paths of transmitting electrons into flat energy bands and dispersive bands. A phenomenological double Fano resonance model reveals the hybridization between these bands below the hybridization temperature $T_{\mathrm{hyb}}=23$ K. This hybridization drives an opening of a pseudogap below a characteristic temperature $T_{\mathrm{PG}}=6.8$ K. In the superconducting state, we observe an unusual upper critical field that increases linearly with decreasing temperatures from $0.4T_{c}$ to $0.01T_{c}$, suggestive of a possible exotic superconducting state. Our results suggest the presence of surface flat energy bands that stem from nontrivial topological nature of nodal lines in the bulk band structure and the hybridization between the surface flat bands and bulk bands in Sn$_{0.15}$NbSe$_{1.75}$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity in a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the equations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as inhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional nonlinear term affects the magnetic field and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for which the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant and a low temperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. We found that flux jumps occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures.</description>

      <title>On the engineering of higher-order Van Hove singularities in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of correlated electron materials are often intricately linked to Van Hove singularities (VHS) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The class of these VHS is of great importance, with higher-order ones -- with power-law divergence in the density of states -- leaving frequently distinct signatures in physical properties. We use a new theoretical method to detect and analyse higher-order VHS (HOVHS) in two-dimensional materials and apply it to the electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We then constrain a low energy model of the VHS of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ against angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference data to analyse the VHS near the Fermi level. We show how these VHS can be engineered into HOVHS.</description>

      <title>Density matrix renormalization group study of quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, scrutiny through sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain in the strong-coupling regime the phase diagram as a function of doping concentration and a tuning interaction parameter for a simple two-orbital model that incorporates quantum geometric effects. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase spanning a broad range of parameters, characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K_{sc} \sim 0.3$ and the absence of coexisting competing spin or charge density wave orders. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometry can promote PDW formation. Our study provides the most compelling numerical evidence to date for quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, paving the way for further exploration of novel PDW orders and quantum geometric effects in such systems.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Behavior of High-Permittivity Gate Dielectrics: The Impact of the Atomic Layer Deposition Temperature and the Lithographic Patterning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>
