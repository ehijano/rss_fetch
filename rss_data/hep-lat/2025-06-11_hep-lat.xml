      <title>Numerical stability of force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free variants in lattice QCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical stability of force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free variants within the molecular dynamics step of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm in lattice QCD simulations. A linear stability analysis of (Hessian-free) force-gradient integrators is conducted by investigating the harmonic oscillator as a test equation. By performing detailed stability investigations for the entire family of self-adjoint integrators with up to eleven exponentials per time step, we detect promising integrator variants that are providing a good trade-off between accuracy and numerical stability. Simulations for the two-dimensional Schwinger model demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the stability domain of a force-gradient integrator and its Hessian-free counterpart. Furthermore, lattice QCD simulations are conducted to emphasize the significance of numerical stability as a metric for evaluating the computational efficiency of integrators when applied to lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods: c-reflection symmetry and factorization of the Butcher tableau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-storage Runge-Kutta schemes of Williamson's type, so-called 2N-storage schemes, are further examined as a follow-up to the recent work. It is found that the augmented Butcher tableau factorizes into a product of matrices with special properties. Those properties reveal that the 2N-storage methods of the order of global accuracy less than five possess a symmetry, called c-reflection symmetry, i.e. most methods exist in pairs. A transformation that relates the Butcher tableaux of the pairs is found and the fact that the c-reflected method satisfies the same order conditions as the original one is proven. Numerical evidence that validates the analytic results is presented. Branches of solutions for (5,4) methods, first explored by Carpenter and Kennedy, are constructed numerically. Four new (5,4) schemes with coefficients expressed in radicals and one with rational coefficients are examined for illustration. Eight new (6,4) schemes, some of which can be expressed in rationals or radicals, and one (8,4) scheme, are studied to understand the practical implications of the c-reflection symmetry for methods with higher number of stages. In the absence of closed-form analytic solutions for 2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods of order four and above, the general symmetry properties, as well as some specific analytic solutions presented here, may help in development and optimization of 2N-storage schemes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like particles using lattice QCD calculations of the rate for $J/\psi \to \gamma a$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key search mode for axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to charm quarks is $J/\psi \to \gamma a$. Here we calculate the form factor that allows the rate of this process to be determined using lattice QCD for the first time. Our calculations use the relativistic Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for the valence charm quarks on gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration that include $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ HISQ quarks in the sea at four values of the lattice spacing and both unphysical and physical sea quark masses. We determine the form factor as a function of ALP mass with an uncertainty of less than 2\% across our full range of ALP masses from zero up to 95\% of the $J/\psi$ mass. This represents a substantial improvement in accuracy of the theoretical picture of this decay compared to the previously used tree-level and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ perturbation theory. We use our form factor to determine constraints on ALP masses and couplings to charm quarks and photons in several different scenarios using recent experimental data from BESIII. Our calculation paves the way for further lattice QCD input on new physics constraints from radiative decays.</description>

      <title>Chiral and deconfinement thermal transitions at finite quark spin polarization in lattice QCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of finite spin quark density on the chiral and deconfinement thermal crossovers using numerical simulations of lattice QCD with two dynamical light quarks. The finite spin density is introduced by the quark spin potential in the canonical formulation of the spin operator. We show that both chiral and deconfinement temperatures are decreasing functions of the spin potential. We determine the parabolic curvatures of crossover temperatures in a limit of physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic effects on light pseudo-scalar meson masses within the SU(3) Nambu-Jona--Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the screening masses of pseudoscalar mesons in a hot and strongly magnetized medium within the framework of the SU(3) Nambu-Jona--Lasinio model, using a magnetic field-independent regularization scheme. Inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) is implemented through the use of a magnetic field-dependent coupling $G(B)$, fitted to reproduce lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results for the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature $T_c^B$. For the external homogeneous magnetic field considered, neutral screening masses separate in two types: perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the field, while for charged mesons only parallel energies can be defined for each Landau level. We obtain $m_{\mathrm{scr},\perp} &gt; m_{\mathrm{scr},\parallel}$, as expected from causality. Thermally, all screening energies are almost constant until some critical temperature, whose behavior is correlated with $T_c^B$. They rapidly increase around this value, keeping a steady enhancement afterward due to thermal excitation. Magnetically, neutral parallel masses are enhanced (suppressed) at high temperatures when considering $G(B)$ ($G$). Perpendicular ones display a non-monotonic magnetic behavior for $G$ (due to increasing $T_c^B$) when $T \lesssim 500$~MeV, but become magnetically enhanced when $T \gtrsim 500$~MeV. For $G(B)$ they always increase with $B$. Charged parallel energies are always magnetically enhanced, for both couplings. In the high-temperature limit, we show that both neutral and charged screening energies converge to $2\pi T$. At $B=0$ the model overestimates the remaining quark interaction in this regime. At $B\neq 0$ we find that, when IMC is accounted for, the interaction is suppressed as $B$ increases, a fact that appears to be at odds with currently available lattice QCD results.</description>
