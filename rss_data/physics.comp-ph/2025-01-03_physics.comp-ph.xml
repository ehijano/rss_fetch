      <title>Machine learning models for Si nanoparticle growth in nonthermal plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) formed in nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) can have unique properties and applications. However, modeling their growth in these environments presents significant challenges due to the non-equilibrium nature of NTPs, making them computationally expensive to describe. In this work, we address the challenges associated with accelerating the estimation of parameters needed for these models. Specifically, we explore how different machine learning models can be tailored to improve prediction outcomes. We apply these methods to reactive classical molecular dynamics data, which capture the processes associated with colliding silane fragments in NTPs. These reactions exemplify processes where qualitative trends are clear, but their quantification is challenging, hard to generalize, and requires time-consuming simulations. Our results demonstrate that good prediction performance can be achieved when appropriate loss functions are implemented and correct invariances are imposed. While the diversity of molecules used in the training set is critical for accurate prediction, our findings indicate that only a fraction (15-25\%) of the energy and temperature sampling is required to achieve high levels of accuracy. This suggests a substantial reduction in computational effort is possible for similar systems.</description>

      <title>Adapting Atmospheric Chemistry Components for Efficient GPU Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric models demand a lot of computational power and solving the chemical processes is one of its most computationally intensive components. This work shows how to improve the computational performance of the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry model (MONARCH), a chemical weather prediction system developed by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. The model implements the new flexible external package Chemistry Across Multiple Phases (CAMP) for the solving of gas- and aerosol-phase chemical processes, that allows multiple chemical processes to be solved simultaneously as a single system. We introduce a novel strategy to simultaneously solve multiple instances of a chemical mechanism, represented in the model as grid-cells, obtaining a speedup up to 9x using thousands of cells. In addition, we present a GPU strategy for the most time-consuming function of CAMP. The GPU version achieves up to 1.2x speedup compared to CPU. Also, we optimize the memory access in the GPU to increase its speedup up to 1.7x.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Path Planning of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.</description>

      <title>Finite difference physics-informed neural networks enable improved solution accuracy of the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating an accurate solution of the Navier--Stokes equations using physics--informed neural networks (PINNs) for higher Reynolds numbers in the corners of a lid--driven cavity problem is challenging. In this paper, we improve the solution accuracy of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the region near the walls significantly and generate accurate secondary vortices in the corners of the lid--driven cavity by solving the governing equations using finite difference--based PINNs (FD--PINNs) without employing the known solution. We adopt the domain decomposition method (DDM) and combine it with the FD--PINNs to solve the lid--driven cavity problem for the Reynolds numbers Re = 400 and Re=1000. A comparison of the mean square error (MSE) between the presented and standard FD--PINNs using the reference solution is exhibited, showing the accuracy and effectiveness of the new approach.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Sampling Using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Pseudo)random sampling, a costly yet widely used method in (probabilistic) machine learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, remains unfeasible on a truly large scale due to unmet computational requirements. We introduce an energy-efficient algorithm for uniform Float16 sampling, utilizing a room-temperature stochastic magnetic tunnel junction device to generate truly random floating-point numbers. By avoiding expensive symbolic computation and mapping physical phenomena directly to the statistical properties of the floating-point format and uniform distribution, our approach achieves a higher level of energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art Mersenne-Twister algorithm by a minimum factor of 9721 and an improvement factor of 5649 compared to the more energy-efficient PCG algorithm. Building on this sampling technique and hardware framework, we decompose arbitrary distributions into many non-overlapping approximative uniform distributions along with convolution and prior-likelihood operations, which allows us to sample from any 1D distribution without closed-form solutions. We provide measurements of the potential accumulated approximation errors, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Predicting Crack Nucleation and Propagation in Brittle Materials Using Deep Operator Networks with Diverse Trunk Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field modeling reformulates fracture problems as energy minimization problems and enables a comprehensive characterization of the fracture process, including crack nucleation, propagation, merging, and branching, without relying on ad-hoc assumptions. However, the numerical solution of phase-field fracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet) consisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture problems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network configurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a two-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In the second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the mathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network's loss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results in a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third approach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model crack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end displacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single edge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and shear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields accurately, and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.</description>

      <title>Programming guide for solving constraint satisfaction problems with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a class of problems that are ubiquitous in science and engineering. It features a collection of constraints specified over subsets of variables. A CSP can be solved either directly or by reducing it to other problems. This paper introduces the Julia ecosystem for solving and analyzing CSPs, focusing on the programming practices. We introduce some of the important CSPs and show how these problems are reduced to each other. We also show how to transform CSPs into tensor networks, how to optimize the tensor network contraction orders, and how to extract the solution space properties by contracting the tensor networks with generic element types. Examples are given, which include computing the entropy constant, analyzing the overlap gap property, and the reduction between CSPs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum-Dot Engineered Solid-State Photon Upconversion in PbS:$Yb^{3+},Er^{3+}$/CuBiO Using Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning Methods for Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of a quantum-dot-engineered heterostructure, PbS:$Yb^{3+},Er^{3+}$/CuBiO, optimized for water splitting applications. Using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with machine learning, the study explores the electronic, optical, and catalytic properties of the material. The optimized PbS structure exhibited a direct bandgap of 1.191 eV, while co-doping with Yb and Er transitioned the material to a metallic state, enhancing charge carrier mobility and electron-hole separation. The final heterostructure displayed an indirect bandgap of 0.431 eV, favorable for visible-light absorption. Key findings include an internal electric field strength of 6.3 Debye, efficient charge transfer confirmed by Bader analysis, and strong optical absorption at 2.4 eV. Machine learning models, including DNN and LSTM, were employed to predict photon absorption rates, achieving mean squared errors as low as 0.0004. The synergistic effects of enhanced internal electric fields, optimized band structures, and strong photon absorption underscore the materials' potential for efficient hydrogen production. This study bridges advanced computational methods and machine learning, offering a framework for designing high-performance photocatalysts in renewable energy applications.</description>

      <title>AI and Quantum Computing in Binary Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a sustainable pathway for hydrogen production, leveraging sunlight to drive chemical reactions. This review explores the integration of density functional theory (DFT) with machine learning (ML) to accelerate the discovery, optimization, and design of photocatalysts. DFT provides quantum-mechanical insights into electronic structures and reaction mechanisms, while ML algorithms enable high-throughput analysis of material properties, prediction of catalytic performance, and inverse design. This paper emphasizes advancements in binary photocatalytic systems, highlighting materials like $TiO_2$, $BiVO_4$, and $g-C_3N_4$, as well as novel heterojunctions and co-catalysts that improve light absorption and charge separation efficiency. Key breakthroughs include the use of ML architectures such as random forests, support vector regression, and neural networks, trained on experimental and computational datasets to optimize band gaps, surface reactions, and hydrogen evolution rates. Emerging techniques like quantum machine learning (QML) and generative models (GANs, VAEs) demonstrate the potential to explore hypothetical materials and enhance computational efficiency. The review also highlights advanced light sources, such as tunable LEDs and solar simulators, for experimental validation of photocatalytic systems. Challenges related to data standardization, scalability, and interpretability are addressed, proposing collaborative frameworks and open-access repositories to democratize DFT-AI tools. By bridging experimental and computational methodologies, this synergistic approach offers transformative potential for achieving scalable, cost-effective hydrogen production, paving the way for sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interaction Kernels for Many-Particle Systems by a Two-Phase Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-phase method for learning interaction kernels of stochastic many-particle systems. After transforming stochastic trajectories of every particle into the particle density function by the kernel density estimation method, the first phase of our approach combines importance sampling with an adaptive threshold strategy to identify key terms in the kernel function, while the second phase uses the whole dataset to refine the coefficients. During the implementation of our method, the mean-field equation plays a key role in reformulating the task of extracting the interaction kernels into a learnable regression problem. We demonstrate the outstanding performance of our approach through extensive numerical examples, including interacting particle systems with a cubic potential, power-law repulsion-attraction potential, piecewise linear potential, as well as a two-dimensional radially symmetric potential.</description>

      <title>Adjoint shape optimization from the continuum to free-molecular gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adjoint-based shape optimization method for solid bodies subjected to both rarefied and continuum gas flows is proposed. The gas-kinetic BGK equation with the diffuse-reflection boundary condition is used to describe the multiscale gas flows. In the vicinity of the gas-solid interface, a body-fitted mesh is utilized, and the sensitivity with respect to the boundary geometry is analyzed through a combined continuous and discrete adjoint methods. The primal and adjoint governing equations are resolved using efficient multiscale numerical schemes, ensuring the precision of the sensitivity analysis in all flow regimes. The sensitivity data is subsequently integrated into a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm to facilitate rapid convergence towards the optimal solution. Numerical experiments reveal that the discretization of the molecular velocity space can induce sensitivity oscillations; however, these can be effectively eliminated by employing appropriate parameterization of the boundary geometry. In optimizing 2D airfoils for drag reduction under varying degrees of gas rarefaction, our method achieves the optimal solution in just a dozen optimization iterations and within a time frame of 5 to 20 minutes (utilizing parallel computation with 40 to 160 cores), thereby underscoring its exceptional performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving collisional particle method for the Landau kinetic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and implement a structure-preserving stochastic particle method for the Landau equation. The method is based on a particle system for the Landau equation, where pairwise grazing collisions are modeled as diffusion processes. By exploiting the unique structure of the particle system and a spherical Brownian motion sampling, the method avoids additional temporal discretization of the particle system, ensuring that the discrete-time particle distributions exactly match their continuous-time counterparts. The method achieves $O(N)$ complexity per time step and preserves fundamental physical properties, including the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, as well as entropy dissipation. It demonstrates strong long-time accuracy and stability in numerical experiments. Furthermore, we also apply the method to the spatially non-homogeneous equations through a case study of the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau equation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Transient Heat Conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast and nanoscale heat conduction demands a unified theoretical framework that rigorously bridges macroscopic transport equations with microscopic material properties derived from statistical physics.Existing empirical generalizations of Fourier's law often lack a solid microscopic foundation, failing to connect observed non-Fourier behavior with underlying atomic scale mechanisms. In this work, we present a time-domain theory of transient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's statistical theory of irreversible processes. Central to this framework is the time-domain transport function, Z(t), defined through equilibrium time-correlation functions of heat fluxes. This function generalizes the conventional concept of steady-state thermal conductivity, governing the transition of conduction dynamics from onset second sound type wave propagation at finite speeds to diffusion-dominated behavior across broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike phonon hydrodynamic models that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon drift velocity, our approach provides a quantitative and microscopic description of intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies universally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By integrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with continuum-level macroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust foundation for numerical simulations of transient temperature fields. Furthermore, it facilitates the interpretation and design of transient thermal grating experiments using nanometer-scale heat sources and ultrafast laser systems in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelength ranges, advancing our understanding of heat dissipation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning Weather Models from Data with WSINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension. Moreover, we develop an approach for handling terms that are not integrable-by-parts, such as advection operators.</description>

      <title>Thread-safe multiphase lattice Boltzmann model for droplet and bubble dynamics at high density and viscosity contrasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a high-order, thread-safe version of the lattice Boltzmann (LBM) method, incorporating an interface-capturing equation, based on the conservative Allen-Cahn equation, to simulate incompressible two-component systems with high-density and viscosity contrasts. The method utilizes a recently proposed thread-safe implementation optimized for shared memory architectures and it is employed to reproduce the dynamics of droplets and bubbles on several test cases with results in agreement with experiments and other numerical simulations from the literature. The proposed approach offers promising opportunities for high-performance computing simulations of realistic fluid systems with high-density and viscosity contrasts for advanced applications in environmental, atmospheric and meteorological flows, all the way down to microfluidic and biological systems, particularly on GPU-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Understanding Memristive Behavior: An Atomistic Study of the Influence of Grain Boundaries on Surface and Out-of-Plane Diffusion of Metallic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs, employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS\textsubscript{2} layer and along the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present in MoS\textsubscript{2} are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine MoS\textsubscript{2} and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key elements that affect the switching performance of memristors. Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance, providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Structure of an axisymmetric turbulent boundary layer under adverse pressure gradient: a large-eddy simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial characteristics and structure of an axisymmetric turbulent boundary layer under strong adverse pressure gradient and weak transverse curvature are investigated using incompressible large-eddy simulation. The boundary layer is on a $20^{\circ}$ tail cone of a body of revolution at a length-based Reynolds number of $1.9\times10^6$. The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental measurements of Balantrapu et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 929, 2021) and significantly expand the experimental results with new flow-field details and physical insights. The mean streamwise velocity profiles exhibit a shortened logarithmic region and a longer wake region compared with planar boundary layers at zero pressure gradient. With the embedded-shear-layer scaling, self-similarity is observed for the mean velocity and all three components of turbulence intensity. The azimuthal-wavenumber spectra of streamwise velocity fluctuations possess two peaks in the wall-normal direction, an inner peak at the wavelength of approximately 100 wall units and an outer peak in the wake region with growing strength, wavelength and distance to the wall in the downstream direction. Two-point correlations of streamwise velocity fluctuations show significant downstream growth and elongation of turbulence structures with increasing inclination angle. However, relative to the boundary-layer thickness, the correlation structures decrease in size in the downstream direction. The distributions of streamwise and wall-normal integral lengths across the boundary-layer thickness resemble those of zero-pressure-gradient planar boundary layers, whereas the azimuthal integral length deviates from the planar boundary-layer behavior at downstream stations.</description>

Abstract: Langevin and Brownian simulations play a prominent role in computational research, and state of the art integration algorithms provide trajectories with different stability ranges and accuracy in reproducing statistical averages. The practical usability of integrators is an important aspect to allow choosing large time steps while ensuring numerical stability and overall computational efficiency. In this work, different use cases and practical features are selected in order to perform a cumulative comparison of integrators with a focus on evaluating the derived velocity and position autocorrelation functions, a comparison that is often disregarded in the literature. A standard industrial open-source software methodology is suggested to compare systematically the different algorithms.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian Systems and Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Hamilton-Dirac Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of the Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for learning the dynamics of constrained Hamiltonian systems is demonstrated using the Dirac theory of constraints for regular systems with holonomic constraints and systems with non-standard Lagrangians. By utilizing Dirac brackets, we derive the Hamilton-Dirac equations and minimize their residuals, incorporating also energy conservation and the Dirac constraints, using appropriate regularization terms in the loss function. The resulting PINNs, referred to as Hamilton-Dirac Neural Networks (HDNNs), successfully learn constrained dynamics without deviating from the constraint manifold. Two examples with holonomic constraints are presented: the nonlinear pendulum in Cartesian coordinates and a two-dimensional, elliptically restricted harmonic oscillator. In both cases, HDNNs exhibit superior performance in preserving energy and constraints compared to traditional explicit solvers. To demonstrate applicability in systems with singular Lagrangians, we computed the guiding center motion in a strong magnetic field starting from the guiding center Lagrangian. The imposition of energy conservation during the neural network training proved essential for accurately determining the orbits of the guiding center. The HDNN architecture enables the learning of parametric dependencies in constrained dynamics by incorporating a problem-specific parameter as an input, in addition to the time variable. Additionally, an example of semi-supervised, data-driven learning of guiding center dynamics with parameter inference is presented.</description>

      <title>A multiscale hybrid Maxwellian-Monte-Carlo Coulomb collision algorithm for particle simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb collisions in particle simulations for weakly coupled plasmas are modeled by the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation, which is typically solved by Monte-Carlo (MC) methods. One of the main disadvantages of MC is the timestep accuracy constraint {\nu}&lt;&lt;1 to resolve the collision frequency {\nu}. The constraint becomes extremely stringent for self-collisions in the presence of high-charge state species and for inter-species collisions with large mass disparities (such as present in Inertial Confinement Fusion hohlraums), rendering long-time-scale simulations prohibitively expensive or impractical. To overcome these difficulties, we explore a hybrid Maxwellian-MC (HMMC) model for particle simulations. Specifically, we devise a collisional algorithm that describes weakly collisional species with particles, and highly collisional species and fluid components with Maxwellians. We employ the Lemons method for particle-Maxwellian collisions, enhanced with a more careful treatment of low-relative-speed particles, and a five-moment model for Maxwellian-Maxwellian collisions. Particle-particle binary collisions are dealt with classic Takizuka-Abe MC, which we extend to accommodate arbitrary particle weights to deal with large density disparities without compromising conservation properties. HMMC is strictly conservative and significantly outperforms standard MC methods in situations with large mass disparities among species or large charge states, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency. We will substantiate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method with several examples of varying complexity, including both zero-dimensional relaxation and one-dimensional transport problems, the latter using a hybrid kinetic-ion/fluid-electron model.</description>

      <title>Fast and scalable finite-element based approach for density functional theory calculations using projector-augmented wave method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($&gt;$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations using finite-element discretized calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show how different sources of random numbers influence the outcomes of Monte Carlo simulations. We compare industry-standard pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to a quantum random number generator (QRNG) and show, using examples of Monte Carlo simulations with exact solutions, that the QRNG yields statistically significantly better approximations than the PRNGs. Our results demonstrate that higher accuracy can be achieved in the commonly known Monte Carlo method for approximating $\pi$. For Buffon's needle experiment, we further quantify a potential reduction in approximation errors by up to $1.89\times$ for optimal parameter choices when using a QRNG and a reduction of the sample size by $\sim 8\times$ for sub-optimal parameter choices. We attribute the observed higher accuracy to the underlying differences in the random sampling, where a uniformity analysis reveals a tendency of the QRNG to sample the solution space more homogeneously.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>

Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>Using pretrained graph neural networks with token mixers as geometric featurizers for conformational dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying informative low-dimensional features that characterize dynamics in molecular simulations remains a challenge, often requiring extensive manual tuning and system-specific knowledge. Here, we introduce geom2vec, in which pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as universal geometric featurizers. By pretraining equivariant GNNs on a large dataset of molecular conformations with a self-supervised denoising objective, we obtain transferable structural representations that are useful for learning conformational dynamics without further fine-tuning. We show how the learned GNN representations can capture interpretable relationships between structural units (tokens) by combining them with expressive token mixers. Importantly, decoupling training the GNNs from training for downstream tasks enables analysis of larger molecular graphs (such as small proteins at all-atom resolution) with limited computational resources. In these ways, geom2vec eliminates the need for manual feature selection and increases the robustness of simulation analyses.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Robust altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX$_3$-based (X = S or Se) heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of materials with intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures. For the AB-stacking heterostructures that are semiconducting, ferrimagnetic-type spin splitting emerges, and the fully compensated magnetization is protected by the Luttinger theorem. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP$_2$S$_6$, MnPX$_3$-based heterostructures can show tunable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on the electronic band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</description>
