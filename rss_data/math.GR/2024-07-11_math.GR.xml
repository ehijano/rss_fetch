      <title>Representation growth of Fuchsian groups and modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a cocompact, oriented Fuchsian group which is not on an explicit finite list of possible exceptions and $q$ a sufficiently large prime power not divisible by the order of any non-trivial torsion element of $\Gamma$. Then $|\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,\mathrm{GL}_n(q))|\sim c_{q,n} q^{(1-\chi(\Gamma))n^2}$, where $c_{q,n}$ is periodic in $n$. As a function of $q$, $c_{q,n}$ can be expressed as a Puiseux series in $1/q$ whose coefficients are periodic in $n$ and $q$. Moreover, this series is essentially the $q$-expansion of a meromorphic modular form of half-integral weight.</description>

      <title>Retraction to a parabolic subgroup and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We  continue the study of the retraction  from an Artin group to a standardparabolic  subgroup introduced  by Blufstein,  Charney, Paris and the secondauthor.  Using right  and left  retractions we  obtain new  results on minimalparabolic subgroups, intersection of parabolic subgroups, double cosets withrespect to parabolic subgroups and conjugacy classes in Artin groups.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a real Lie group and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$. Is $\Gamma$ residually finite? This paper describes known positive and negative results then poses some questions whose answers will lead to a fairly complete answer for lattices.</description>

      <title>Embedding groups into boundedly acyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the labeled Thompson groups and the twisted Brin--Thompson groups are boundedly acyclic. This allows us to prove several new embedding results for groups. First, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically into a boundedly acyclic group of type $F_n$ that has no proper finite index subgroups. This improves a result of Bridson \cite{Br98} and a theorem of Fournier-Facio--L\"oh--Moraschini \cite[Theorem 2]{FFCM21}. Second, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically into a $5$-uniformly perfect group of type $F_n$. Third, using Belk--Zaremsky's construction of twisted Brin--Thompson groups, we show that every finitely generated group embeds quasi-isometrically into a finitely generated boundedly acyclic simple group.</description>

      <title>A higher-order generalization of group theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show that fundamental concepts in higher-order Fourier analysis can be nauturally extended to the non-commutative setting. We generalize Gowers norms to arbitrary compact non-commutative groups. On the structural side, we show that nilspace theory (the algebraic part of higher-order Fourier analysis) can be naturally extended to include all non-commutative groups. To this end, we introduce generalized nilspaces called "groupspaces" and demonstrate that they possess properties very similar to nilspaces. We study $k$-th order generalizations of groups that are special groupspaces called {\it k-step} groupspaces. One step groupspaces are groups. We show that $k$-step groupspaces admit the structure of an iterated principal bundle with structure groups $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_k$. A similar, but somewhat more technical statement holds for general groupspaces, with possibly infinitely many structure groups. Structure groups of groupspaces are in some sense analogous to higher homotopy groups. In particular we use a version of the Eckmann-Hilton argument from homotopy theory to show that $G_i$ is abelian for $i\geq 2$. Groupspaces also show some similarities with $n$-groups from higher category theory (also used in physics) but the exact relationship between these concepts is a subject of future research.</description>

      <title>The Deletion Order and Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deletion order of a finitely generated Coxeter group W is a total order on the elements which, as is proved, is a refinement of the Bruhat order. This order is applied in [8] to construct Elnitsky tilings for any finite Coxeter group. Employing the deletion order, a corresponding normal form of an element w of W is defined which is shown to be the same as the normal form of w using right to left lexicographic ordering. Further results on the deletion order are obtained relating to the property of being Artinian and, when W is finite, its interplay with the longest element of W.</description>

      <title>Weight conjectures for Parker--Semeraro fusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Parker--Semeraro systems satisfy six of the nine Kessar--Linckelmann--Lynd--Semeraro weight conjectures for saturated fusion systems. As a by-product we obtain that Robinson's ordinary weight conjecture holds for the principal $3$-block of Aut$(G_2(3))$, the principal $5$-blocks of $HN$, $BM$, Aut$(HN)$, $Ly$, the principal $7$-block of $M$, and the principal $p$-blocks of $G_2(p)$ for $p\geq 3 $.</description>

      <title>Isotypic equivalence of Abelian p-groups with separable reduced parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that two Abelian $p$-groups with separable reduced parts are isotypically equivalent if and only if their divisible parts and their basic subgroups are elementarily equivalent. Also as a corollary we prove that any Abelian $p$-group with a separable reduced part is $\omega$-strongly homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Cluster Magnification, Root Capacity, Unique Chains and Base Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is inspired from the work of Krithika and Vanchinathan on Cluster Magnification and the work of Alexander Perlis on Cluster Size. We establish the existence of polynomials for given degree and cluster size over number fields which generalises a result of Perlis. We state the Strong cluster magnification problem and establish an equivalent criterion for that. We provide an important example answering a question about Cluster Towers. We introduce the concept of Root capacity and prove some of its properties. We also introduce the concept of unique descending and ascending chains for extensions and establish some properties and explicitly compute some interesting examples. Finally we establish results about all these phenomena under a particular type of base change. The article concludes with results about strong cluster magnification and unique chains.</description>

      <title>Non-concentration property of Patterson-Sullivan measures for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. For a Zariski dense Anosov subgroup $\Gamma&lt;G$ with respect to a parabolic subgroup $P_\theta$, we prove that any $\Gamma$-Patterson-Sullivan measure charges no mass on any proper subvariety of $G/P_\theta$. More generally, we prove that for a Zariski dense $\theta$-transverse subgroup $\Gamma&lt;G$, any $(\Gamma, \psi)$-Patterson-Sullivan measure charges no mass on any proper subvariety of $G/P_\theta$, provided the $\psi$-Poincar\'e series of $\Gamma$ diverges at $s=1$. In particular, our result also applies to relatively Anosov subgroups.</description>

      <title>Computing the unit group of a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, i.e., for a commutative ring $R$ whose additive group is finitely generated, it is known that the group of units of $R$ is finitely generated, as well. Our main results are algorithms to compute generators and the structure of this group. This is achieved by reducing the task first to the case of reduced rings, then to torsion-free reduced rings, and finally to an order in a reduced ring. The simplified cases are treated via a calculation of exponent lattices and various algorithms to compute the minimal primes, primitive idempotents, and other basic objects. All algorithms have been implemented and are available as a SageMath package. Whenever possible, the time complexity of the described methods is tracked carefully.</description>
