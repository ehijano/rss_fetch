      <title>Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezoelectric plates, which become electrically polarised in response to bending, have recently been proposed for water wave energy conversion. However, piezoelectric materials (e.g. Polyvinylidene Fluoride) can be anisotropic, which makes them challenging to model in three dimensions. This paper considers the simpler problem of water wave scattering by an anisotropic elastic plate, i.e., the piezoelectric effect is ignored. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the elastic plate modes. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry. Although not considered in this paper, the method we present is applicable to piezoelectric plates, and thereby facilitates the extension of piezoelectric wave energy converter models to the three dimensional water wave setting.</description>

      <title>Elastohydrodynamic instabilities of a soft robotic arm in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and control of soft robots operating in fluid environments requires a careful understanding of the interplay between large elastic body deformations and hydrodynamic forces. Here we show that this interplay leads to novel elastohydrodynamic instabilities in a clamped soft robotic arm driven terminally by a constant pressure in a viscous fluid. We model the arm as a Cosserat rod that can stretch, shear and bend. We obtain invariant, geometrically exact, non-linear equations of motion by using Cartan's method of moving frames. Stability to small perturbations of a straight rod is governed by a non-Hermitian linear operator. Eigenanalysis shows that stability is lost through a Hopf bifurcation with the increase of pressure above a first threshold. A surprising return to stability is obtained with further increase of pressure beyond a second threshold. Numerical solutions of the non-linear equations, using a geometrically exact spectral method, confirms stable limit-cycle oscillations between these two pressure thresholds. An asymptotic analysis in the beam limit rationalizes these results analytically. This counterintuitive sequence of bifurcations underscores the subtle nature of the elastohydrodynamic coupling in Cosserat rods and emphasizes their importance for the control of the viscous dynamics of soft robots.</description>

      <title>The simplest complexity: The story of the three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article offers a broad-brush account of the Newtonian three-body problem, from its origins with Newton to its vibrant present, emphasizing its enduring influence on theoretical physics. It unfolds through a series of self-contained episodes that illuminate the scientific fields and the paradigm shift that have grown out of this problem.</description>

      <title>Lattice-induced sound trapping in biperiodic metasurfaces of acoustic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A referential example of a physical system that supports bound states in the continuum (BICs) with an infinite quality factor ($Q$-factor) is a subwavelength lattice of discrete scatterers (resonators) whose response can be significantly modified by exploiting lattice interactions. In this work, we explore the interference Friedrich-Wintgen mechanism for realizing acoustic BICs (trapped modes) at the $\Gamma$-point (in-plane Bloch wave vector $\mathbf{k}_{\parallel} = \mathbf{0}$) in biperiodic lattices of acoustic resonators with one resonator per unit cell. To do so, we expand the pressure field from the lattice into a series of scalar zonal ($m = 0$) spherical multipoles, carried by a normally incident plane wave, and formulate analytical conditions on the resonator's multipole moments under which an eigenmode becomes a BIC. The conditions allow us to determine the lattice constant and frequency values that enable the formation of the axisymmetric BIC due to the destructive interference of radiation from zonal multipole moments of a certain parity, although each moment radiates individually. By employing the T-matrix method for acoustic metasurfaces, we numerically investigate the BIC resonance in various structures, including finite arrays, and also the transformation of such resonances into high-$Q$ quasi-BIC regimes, which can be excited by a plane wave at normal incidence.</description>
