      <title>Ordered groups of formal series, and a conjugacy problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an ordered field $\mathbb{T}$ of formal series over an ordered field $\mathbf{R}$ equipped with a composition law $\circ \colon \mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{T}^{&gt;\mathbb{R}} \longrightarrow \mathbb{T}$, we give conditions for $(\mathbb{T}^{&gt;\mathbb{R}},\circ)$ to be a group. We show that classical fields of transseries and hyperseries satisfy these conditions. We then give further conditions on $\mathbb{T}$ under which $(\mathbb{T}^{&gt;\mathbb{R}},\circ,&lt;)$ is a linearly ordered group with exactly three conjugacy classes, and solve the open problem of existence of such a group.</description>

      <title>Extending orders to types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an ordered structure, we study a natural way to extend the order to preorders on type spaces. For definably complete, linearly ordered structures, we give a characterisation of the preorder on the space of 1-types. We apply these results to the divisibility preorder on ultrafilters, giving an independence result about the suborder consisting of ultrafilters with only one fixed prime divisor, as well as a classification of ultrafilters with finitely many prime divisors.</description>

      <title>Nonamenable subforests of multi-ended quasi-pmp graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the a.e. nonamenability of locally finite quasi-pmp Borel graphs whose every component admits at least three nonvanishing ends with respect to the underlying Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We witness their nonamenability by constructing Borel subforests with at least three nonvanishing ends per component, and then applying Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob's recent characterization of amenability for acyclic quasi-pmp Borel graphs. Our main technique is a weighted cycle-cutting algorithm, which yields a weight-maximal spanning forest. We also introduce a random version of this forest, which generalizes the Free Minimal Spanning Forest, to capture nonunimodularity in the context of percolation theory.</description>

      <title>Completeness of coalition logics with seriality, independence of agents, or determinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is a central logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In a recent paper, Li and Ju argued that generally, models of Coalition Logic, concurrent game models, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented a Minimal Coalition Logic based on general concurrent game models, which do not have the three assumptions. However, when constructing coalition logics about strategic reasoning in special kinds of situations, we may want to keep some of the assumptions. Thus, studying coalition logics with some of these assumptions makes good sense. In this paper, we show the completeness of these coalition logics in a uniform way.</description>

      <title>All Ordinals are Cop-Robber Ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The game of cops and robbers, played on a fixed graph $G$, is a two-player game, where the cop and the robber (the players) take turns in moving to adjacent vertices. The game finishes if the cop lands on the robber's vertex. In that case we say that the cop wins. If the cop can always win, regardless of the starting positions, we say that $G$ is a cop-win graph.
  For a finite cop-win graph $G$ we can ask for the minimum number $n$ such that, regardless of the starting positions, the game will end in at most $n$ steps. This number is called the maximum capture time of $G$. By looking at finite paths, we see that any non-negative integer is the maximum capture time for a cop-win graph.
  What about infinite cop-win graphs? In this case, the notion of capture time is nicely generalised if one works with ordinals, and so the question becomes which ordinals can be the maximum capture time of a cop-win graph? These ordinals are called CR (Cop-Robber)-ordinals. In this paper we fully settle this by showing that all ordinals are CR-ordinals, answering a question of Bonato, Gordinowicz and Hahn.</description>
