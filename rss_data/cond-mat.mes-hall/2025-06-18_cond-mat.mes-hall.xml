      <title>Non-linear in-plane spin current in spin-orbit coupled 2D hole gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear transport of charge and spin due to the emergence of band geometric effects has garnered much interest in recent years. In this work, we show that a linear in-plane spin current vanishes, whereas a non-linear (second-order) in-plane spin current exists for a generic two-dimensional system having time-reversal symmetry. The intrinsic second-order spin current originates from the spin Berry curvature polarizability. The formulation when applied to 2D hole gases with the $k^3$ Rashba spin-orbit interaction reveals the existence of both transverse and longitudinal second-order in-plane spin currents normal to the spin orientation. Further, the effects of band anisotropy due to additional Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction or an electromagnetic radiation are explored, which allows the generation of additional in-plane spin currents parallel to the spin orientation in the same system. The time-reversal symmetry also prevents any out-of-plane spin current in the second-order. The generation and control over the multiple in-plane spin currents may have important applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quasi-1D Coulomb drag between spin-polarized quantum wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) quantum wires provide a versatile platform for studying strong electron-electron interactions and collective excitations under confinement. Coulomb drag between 1D systems offers a powerful probe of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) physics, with theoretical predictions suggesting distinct power-law in temperature dependencies between the spin-full and the spin-polarized regimes. However, experimental verification has thus far remained limited. Here, we report measurements of reciprocal and nonreciprocal Coulomb drag between vertically coupled quasi-1D quantum wires in the spin-polarized regime. Clear signatures of spin splitting are observed in both the wires conductance and the drag signal. We observed a connection between electron-hole asymmetry and negative drag, and demonstrated different power-law behaviors in spin-full and spin-polarized regimes, yielding consistent TLL interaction parameters. These results validate the theoretical predictions for backscattering induced drag in the reciprocal regime and extend them to the nonreciprocal and the multiple subband regimes. Furthermore, the nonmonotonic density dependence of the reciprocal interaction parameter correlates with the subband occupation of the drag wire, revealing the complexity of the scattering mechanisms in multichannel systems.</description>

      <title>Graphene Nanoribbons as a Majorana Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons support a range of electronic phases that can be controlled via external stimuli. Zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs), in particular, exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state that transitions to a half-metallic phase under a transverse electric field or when embedded inside hexagonal Boron Nitride. Here, we consider a simple model of a heterostructure of a ZGNR with an Ising superconductor and show that, the Ising superconductor with a parent s-wave spin-singlet pairing can induce spin-triplet odd-parity pairing in the half-metallic phase of the ZGNR. The resulting superconducting phase is topologically nontrivial, with gate-tunable transitions that enable the emergence of Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties of multilayered Lieb, transition, and Kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the interconvertibility feature shared between monolayer Lieb and Kagome lattices, which allows mapping transition lattice's stages between these two limits ($\pi/2 \leq\theta \leq 2\pi/3$), in this work we extend the recently proposed one-control ($\theta$) parameter tight-binding model for the case of a multilayer Lieb-Kagome system, by considering the two most-common stacks: AA and AB (Bernal). We systematically study the band transformations between the two lattices by adjusting the interlayer hopping and distance, with or without considering the influence of the nearest interlayer neighbors, for different numbers of stacked layers, and under the application of an external perpendicular electric field. The energetic changes are understood from the perspective of the layer dependence of the pseudospin components and the total probability density distributions. The present framework provides an appropriate and straightforward theoretical approach to continuously investigate the evolution of electronic properties in the multilayer Lieb-Kagome system under various external effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of moir\'e excitons have arisen as a platform for realizing novel phases of light and matter. Here, we study moir\'e polaritons coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate of dark-state excitons confined to a moir\'e superlattice. We develop a variational approach to analyze the optical response of the system and demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton interactions significantly modify the character of moir\'e polaritons, leading to sizable energy shifts of the avoided crossing between the principal polariton branches, and the emergence of an additional, stable repulsive-polariton bound state.</description>

      <title>Effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on topological phases in monolayer ZnIn2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of Rashba and quantum spin Hall effects in non-centrosymmetric systems presents both challenges and opportunities for spintronic applications. While Rashba spin-orbit coupling can disrupt the quantum spin Hall phase, their coexistence may enable additional spintronic functionalities by coupling spin-momentum locking in the bulk with topologically protected edge states. Using the ZnIn$_2$Te$_4$ monolayer as a case study-a predicted polar two-dimensional topological insulator-we investigate how intrinsic and Rashba spin-orbit coupling compete within a single material. Our results identify key conditions under which sizable Rashba spin splitting can coexist with a stable quantum spin Hall phase, offering guidance for engineering quantum spin Hall insulators with enhanced spintronic capabilities.</description>

      <title>SOT Enabled 3D Magnetic Field Sensor with Low Offset and High Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetic field sensor, designed as a Ta/CoFeB/MgO structure, with high sensitivity and capable of active offset compensation in all three spatial directions. This is described and verified in both experiment and simulation. The measurements of magnetic fields showed an offset of 36, 50, and 37$\mathrm{\mu T}$ for x-, y-, and z-fields. Furthermore, the sensitivities of these measurements had values of 590, 580, and 490$\mathrm{V\,A^{-1}\,T^{-1}}$ in the x-, y-, and z-direction. In addition, the robustness to bias fields is demonstrated via experiments and single spin simulations by applying bias fields in y-direction. Cross sensitivities were further analyzed via single spin simulations performing a parameter sweep of different bias fields in the y- and z-direction up to $\pm$1mT. Finally, the extraction of the SOT parameters $\eta_\mathrm{DL}$ and $\eta_\mathrm{FL}$ is shown via optimization of a single-spin curve to the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Solitonic Andreev Spin Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of superconducting spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. The two SASQ states are the degenerate spin orientations of an Andreev bound state trapped in a circular Josephson junction with a Corbino disk geometry, created on a 2DEG. The junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The fluxoid mismatch produces a cancellation of the induced pairing that traps unconventional spin-degenerate Andreev bound states analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi solitons. They are localized at a position around the junction that can be controlled by changing the superconducting phase difference. Moving a soliton with a phase bias induces a holonomic rotation of its spin, by virtue of the spin-orbit coupling in the 2DEG. The holonomic qubit trajectories can densely cover the full Bloch sphere as the soliton revolves around the junction. Effects of non-holonomic (dynamic) qubit drift are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric and localization in a quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the quantum metric to understand the properties of quasicrystals, represented by the one-dimensional (1D) Fibonacci chain. We show that the quantum metric can relate the localization properties of the eigenstates to the scale-invariance of both the chain and its energy spectrum. In particular, the quantum metric incorporates information about distances between the local symmetry centers of each eigenstate, making it much more sensitive to the localization properties of quasicrystals than other measures of localization, such as the inverse participation ratio. We further find that a full description of localization requires us to introduce a new phasonic component to the quantum metric, and a mixed phason-position Chern number. Finally, we show that the sum of both position and phasonic components of the quantum metric is lower-bounded by the gap labels associated with each energy gap of the Fibonacci chain. This establishes a direct link between the spatial localization and fractal energy spectrum of quasicrystals. Taken together, the quantum metric provides a unifying, yet accessible, understanding of quasicrystals, rooted in their scale-invariance and with intriguing consequences also for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $\theta$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Monte Carlo in the Angular Momentum Basis for a Chain of Planar Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach that uses the angular momentum representation for the description of interacting rotor systems. Such a choice of representation allows the calculation of momentum properties without having to break the paths. The discrete nature of the momentum basis also allows the use of rejection-free Gibbs sampling techniques. To illustrate the method, we study the collective behavior of $N$ confined planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions, a system known to exhibit a quantum phase transition from a disordered to an ordered state at zero temperature. Ground state properties are obtained using the Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) method. We propose a Bond-Hamiltonian decomposition for the high temperature density matrix factorization of the imaginary time propagator. We show that \textit{cluster-loop} type moves are necessary to overcome ergodicity issues and to achieve efficient Markov Chain updates. Ground state energies and angular momentum properties are computed and compared with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) benchmark results. In particular, the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to the interaction strength estimator is presented as a successful order parameter for the detection of the quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Response of Comagnetometer to Exotic Spin-Dependent Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comagnetometers offer unique advantages in measuring exotic spin-dependent interactions by suppressing magnetic noise. Understanding the frequency response to exotic interactions is essential for evaluating and improving the sensitivity of comagnetometers, as the signals often exhibit distinct spectral features. We conduct theoretical and experimental studies on the frequency response of a differential comagnetometer. We derive analytical expressions for the frequency response of the differential comagnetometer to both magnetic field and exotic couplings, along with the conversion relationship between them. Based on this, we revise the method for determining the axion-nucleon coupling strength with comagnetometers. Furthermore, we introduce a light-shift-based calibration protocol to verify the response to exotic interactions. This work helps predict the sensitivity of comagnetometers in detecting exotic fields and advances the exploration of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Optical spin-orbit interaction induced by magnetic textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrary to the optical spin angular momentum (SAM), the role played by the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light in magneto-optics remains largely unexplored. However, the SAM and OAM are known to be coupled when light interacts with non-homogeneous and non-isotropic materials. Here we predict that the OAM carried by each photon in a light beam is modified upon reflection on magnetic textures like skyrmions, and that the sign of this variation is governed by the SAM of the incident field. Our predictions can be readily tested by performing circular dichroism measurements, and may provide new routes to shape light's angular momentum with magnetism.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switching control of spin current in graphene proximitized by In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By utilizing the proximity effect, we introduce a platform that exploits ferroelectric switching to modulate spin currents in graphene proximitized by ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ monolayer. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we studied the electronic structure of graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure for twist angles of 0$^{\circ}$ and 17.5$^{\circ}$, considering both ferroelectric polarizations. We discover that switching the ferroelectric polarization reverses the sign of the charge-to-spin conversion coefficients, acting as a chirality switch of the in-plane spin texture in graphene. For the twisted heterostructure, we observed emergence of unconventional radial Rashba field for one ferroelectric polarization direction. Additionally, we demonstrated that the Rashba phase can be directly extracted from the ratio of conversion efficiency coefficients, providing a straightforward approach to characterize the in-plane spin texture in graphene. All the unique features of the studied graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure can be experimentally detected, offering a promising approach for developing advanced spintronic devices with enhanced performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent modulation in InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions by scanning gate microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InSb nanoflags represent an interesting platform for quantum transport and have recently been exploited in the study of hybrid planar Josephson junctions. Due to the uncovered semiconductor surface, they are also good candidates for surface probe techniques. Here, we report the first Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) experiments on Nb-contacted InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions. In the normal state, sizable conductance modulation via the charged tip of the SGM is recorded. In the superconducting state, we report the first application of Scanning Gate Microscopy to superconducting weak links, demonstrating the possibility of manipulating the supercurrent flow across a semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure at a local level. The experimental findings are consistent with theoretical predictions and establish a new way of investigating the behavior of superconducting weak links, towards the local imaging of supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>Transition from edge- to bulk-currents in the quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05138v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect can be observed in a two-dimensional conductor penetrated by a perpendicular magnetic field and with edges connecting the current carrying contacts. Its signature is a state of quantized Hall and simultaneously vanishing longitudinal resistances. A widely accepted model is the Landauer-B\"uttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by current carrying one-dimensional edge channels. This single-particle model is challenged by the screening theory. It derives, that electron-electron interaction leads to a fragmentation of the Hall bar into compressible and incompressible strips, where the current flows inside the incompressible strips. Because the latter gradually shift from the sample edges into the bulk as the magnetic field is increased, it suggests a transition from edge- to bulk-current. We present a direct experimental proof of this transition. Our results support the screening theory.</description>

      <title>Random-Flux-Induced Transition Sequence between Weak and Strong Topological Phases with Anisotropic Localization Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that random flux is able to drive nontrivial topological phase transitions, in particular between weak topological insulators (WTIs) and Chern insulators (CIs), illustrated on an anisotropic Wilson-Dirac model in two dimensions. Remarkably, an intriguing topological transition sequence WTIs$\rightarrow$CIs$\rightarrow$WTIs occurs with the reentrance to a WTI but of different weak topology, which is unattainable with chemical potential disorder. The involvement of anisotropy and weak topology in such a transition gives rise to emergent quasi-critical points, where eigen states are extended in one spatial direction but localized in the other one. This new quantum criticality lies outside the conventional quantum Hall universality class. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the random-flux-induced phase transitions and quantum criticality from both bulk and boundary perspectives. Our results describe a qualitatively new disorder effect based on the interplay of random flux with topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Designing Flat Bands and Pseudo-Landau Levels in GaAs with Patterned Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial Berry curvature. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial quantum geometry and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic motion of Weyl fermions in $^3$He-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of the normal component of superfluid $^3$He - A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He - A phase immersed in a non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. We do not consider the dynamics of the superfluid component itself and thereby its backreaction effects due to normal component macroscopic flow. It is being treated as an external background within which the emergent relativistic fermions of the normal component move. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space for the two axially charged Weyl fermions living at the Fermi points which may be replaced by one featuring a Dirac fermion doublet with a real valued vierbein, an axial Abelian gauge field and a spin connection gauge field mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. We carry out this change of description in detail and determine the constraints on the superfluid background as well as the the normal component motion as determined from the Zubarev statistical operator formalism in global thermodynamic equilibrium. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamic quantities of the normal component are analyzed. Our formulation incorporates both superfluid background flow and macroscopic motion flow of the normal component and thereby enables an analysis of their interrelation.</description>

      <title>Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry themselves, eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study experimentally the impact of the additive fabrication method on the magnetic properties of Fe$^+$-implanted Pd square artificial spin ice lattices. Our findings show that the lattices exhibit a higher ordering temperature than their continuous film counterparts. This behavior is attributed to the additive fabrication process, which induces an inhomogeneous Fe concentration within the lattice building blocks. Moreover, the implantation process creates a magnetic depth profile, enabling temperature-dependent tunability of the magnetic thickness. These additional internal degrees of freedom broaden the design possibilities for magnetic metamaterials, allowing precise fine-tuning of their static and dynamic properties to achieve complex and customizable behaviors.</description>

      <title>First-principles predictions of the diversity in atomic structures and electronic properties of the reconstructed Si(111)-7x7 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 7x7 reconstruction of Si(111) surface is widely understood by the dimer-adatom-stacking-fault model (DAS), but the predicted metallicity of DAS contradicts experimental signs of insulation. It is still challenge to predict DAS-like reconstructions by traditional method to solve such a puzzle. Here, we show that low-energy reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with (DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault can be quickly discovered by graph theory as implemented in RG2 code for crystal structure prediction. They exhibit comparable stability to the DAS (DAS-d8-T12) model and similar STM patterns, offering a plausible explanation for the observed Si(111)-7x7 reconstruction. All these reconstructions exhibit metallic behavior in the nonmagnetic (NM) state with isolated narrow bands crossing the Fermi level in varying occupancy. And they are further confirmed as ferromagnetic (FM) metals (DAS-d8-T9H3-B), half-metals (DAS-d8-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3), half-semimetals (DAS-d8-T9H3-A and DAS-d8-T6H6) and even insulators (AB-d10-T12), depending their occupancies of the NM band structures. These findings not only demonstrate the rich electromagnetic phases of reconstructed Si(111) surfaces and their potential for spintronic applications, but also provide a plausible physical explanation for the metal-insulator transition observed on the Si(111) surface.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain. Notably, such a topological correlation function is characterized by critical exponents that appear universal across disorder types, yet they can resolve different topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes each with two terminals along its zigzag edges, while the armchair edges remain free. When a bias is applied to one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization emerges due to transverse momentum matching between the graphene and the metal electrodes. Significant valley polarization is achieved when the Fermi wavevector in the metal exceeds half the separation between the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys in graphene. We analyze how conductance and valley polarization depend on geometric and electronic parameters. While increasing the width enhances both conductance and polarization, increasing the length introduces Fabry--P\'erot oscillations and suppresses valley polarization due to enhanced intervalley mixing. We also examine the effects of disorder: on-site disorder in graphene near the Dirac point increases conductance but reduces valley polarization. Finally, we study the impact of imperfect armchair edges and interface roughness, finding that moderate deviations from ideal conditions still yield substantial valley polarization. Our results demonstrate a viable route to electrically controlling valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate the characteristics of the terahertz (THz) detectors based on perforated graphene layers (PGLs). The PGL structures constitute the interdigital in-plane arrays of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by the sets of narrow constrictions, which form the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. The PGL detector operation is associated with the rectification and hot-carrier bolometric mechanisms. The excitation of plasmonic oscillations in the GMR-GNR arrays can reinforce these mechanisms. The room temperature PGL detector responsivity and detectivity are calculated as function of the radiation frequency and device structure parameters. The effects of the rectification and hot-carrier mechanisms are compared. The PGL THz detectors under consideration can exhibit highly competitive values of responsivity and detectivity.</description>

Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out-of-equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact and mean-field benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Fingerprints Unlocked: Room-Temperature Single-Particle Polarized Spectroscopy Reveals Complete Symmetry Landscape in Rare-Earth Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The point group symmetry of luminescent centers-such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions-fundamentally determines optical transition characteristics, underpinning advances in materials science and optoelectronics. Conventional low-temperature spectroscopy assesses such symmetry through the splitting of optical transitions, yet lacks sensitivity to key vectorial features such as symmetry axis orientations. Here, we introduce a single-particle approach that integrates computational electromagnetism with polarization-resolved microspectroscopy at room temperature, enabling unambiguous mapping of transition dipole orientations from a single magnetic optical transition and thus direct determination of point group symmetry in rare-earth-doped microcrystals. This technique also reveals spontaneous symmetry breaking in chiral space groups during crystallization, giving rise to intrinsic single-particle optical chirality. Leveraging these symmetry insights, we establish a practical protocol for optically polarized sensing of the three-dimensional orientation (3D) of rare-earth-doped single particles in cellular environments. Our method uncovers both the vectorial point group symmetry of rare-earth ions and the chiral nature of the crystal-a level of structural information unattainable by conventional spectroscopic or crystallographic techniques. By bridging microscopic symmetry with macroscopic functionality, this work enables quantitative evaluation of the Forster dipole orientation factor (k2) for rational donor-acceptor design, and lays the foundation for next-generation energy transfer systems, ultra-bright rare-earth nanocrystals, nanophotonic materials, and real-time single-particle sensing in biological contexts.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spin states obtained by extracting $n$ electrons from closed-shell fermionic states. A partition of the system is defined through the introduction of the extraction modes. We derive the expression of the $n$-body reduced density matrices, which represent the extracted spin states. We show that these states exhibit different forms of spin entanglement, whose detection is discussed in terms of the spin squeezing inequalities.</description>
