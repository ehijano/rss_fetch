      <title>Shortest Paths, Convexity, and Treewidth in Regular Hyperbolic Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic tilings are natural infinite planar graphs where each vertex has degree $q$ and each face has $p$ edges for some $\frac1p+\frac1q&lt;\frac12$. We study the structure of shortest paths in such graphs. We show that given a set of $n$ terminals, we can compute a so-called isometric closure (closely related to the geodesic convex hull) of the terminals in near-linear time, using a classic geometric convex hull algorithm as a black box. We show that the size of the convex hull is $O(N)$ where $N$ is the total length of the paths to the terminals from a fixed origin.
  Furthermore, we prove that the geodesic convex hull of a set of $n$ terminals has treewidth only $\max(12,O(\log\frac{n}{p + q}))$, a bound independent of the distance of the points involved. As a consequence, we obtain algorithms for subset TSP and Steiner tree with running time $O(N \log N) + \mathrm{poly}(\frac{n}{p + q}) \cdot N$.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Fast and Correct Computation of Reeb Spaces for PL Bivariate Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reeb space is a fundamental data structure in computational topology that represents the fiber topology of a multi-field (or multiple scalar fields), extending the level set topology of a scalar field. Efficient algorithms have been designed for computing Reeb graphs, however, computing correct Reeb spaces for PL bivariate fields, is a challenging open problem. There are only a few implementable algorithms in the literature for computing Reeb space or its approximation via range quantization or by computing a Jacobi fiber surface which are computationally expensive or have correctness issues, i.e., the computed Reeb space may not be topologically equivalent or homeomorphic to the actual Reeb space. In the current paper, we propose a novel algorithm for fast and correct computation of the Reeb space corresponding to a generic PL bivariate field defined on a triangulation $\mathbb{M}$ of a $3$-manifold without boundary, leveraging the fast algorithms for computing Reeb graphs in the literature.
  Our algorithm is based on the computation of a Multi-Dimensional Reeb Graph (MDRG) which is first proved to be homeomorphic with the Reeb space. For the correct computation of the MDRG, we compute the Jacobi set of the PL bivariate field and its projection into the Reeb space, called the Jacobi structure. Finally, the correct Reeb space is obtained by computing a net-like structure embedded in the Reeb space and then computing its $2$-sheets in the net-like structure. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^2 + n(c_{int})\log (n) + nc_L^2)$, where $n$ is the total number of simplices in $\mathbb{M}$, $c_{int}$ is the number of intersections of the projections of the non-adjacent Jacobi set edges on the range of the bivariate field and $c_L$ is the upper bound on the number of simplices in the link of an edge of $\mathbb{M}$.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Constraints in Polyhedral Enclosure and Tetrahedral Decomposition in Genus-0 Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18222v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a coordinate-free, symbolic framework for determining whether a given set of polygonal faces can form a closed, genus-zero polyhedral surface and for predicting how such a surface could be decomposed into internal tetrahedra. The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in \emph{normal form}, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges for internally decomposed polyhedra with the minimal number of added internal edges. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</description>

      <title>A Continuous and Interpretable Morphometric for Robust Quantification of Dynamic Biological Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Push-Forward Signed Distance Morphometric (PF-SDM) for shape quantification in biomedical imaging. The PF-SDM compactly encodes geometric and topological properties of closed shapes, including their skeleton and symmetries. This provides robust and interpretable features for shape comparison and machine learning. The PF-SDM is mathematically smooth, providing access to gradients and differential-geometric quantities. It also extends to temporal dynamics and allows fusing spatial intensity distributions, such as genetic markers, with shape dynamics. We present the PF-SDM theory, benchmark it on synthetic data, and apply it to predicting body-axis formation in mouse gastruloids, outperforming a CNN baseline in both accuracy and speed.</description>
