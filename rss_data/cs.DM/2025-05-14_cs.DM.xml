      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

      <title>Isolation Forest in Novelty Detection Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data mining offers a diverse toolbox for extracting meaningful structures from complex datasets, with anomaly detection emerging as a critical subfield particularly in the context of streaming or real-time data. Within anomaly detection, novelty detection focuses on identifying previously unseen patterns after training solely on regular data. While classic algorithms such as One-Class SVM or Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have been widely applied, they often lack interpretability and scalability. In this work, we explore the Half-Space Tree (HST) algorithm, originally proposed for streaming anomaly detection, and propose a novel theoretical modification to adapt it specifically for novelty detection tasks. Our approach is grounded in the idea that anomalies i.e., novelties tend to appear in the higher leaves of the tree, which are less frequently visited by regular instances. We analytically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using probabilistic analysis, expected depth (EXD) calculations, and combinatorial reasoning. A comparative analysis of expected depths between our modified HST and the original Isolation Forest highlights that novelty points are significantly more isolated in our approach. This supports the hypothesis that HSTs, with appropriate structural adaptation, can serve as interpretable and efficient novelty detectors. The paper contributes a theoretical foundation and supporting analysis for this adaptation, setting the stage for further application and experimentation.</description>

      <title>On Separating Path and Tree Systems in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the concept of separating systems of vertex sets of graphs. A separating system of a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that for any pair of distinct elements in $X$, there exists a set in the separating system that contains exactly one of the two elements. A separating system of the vertex set of a graph $G$ is called a vertex-separating path (tree) system of $G$ if the elements of the separating system are paths (trees) in the graph $G$. In this paper, we focus on the size of the smallest vertex-separating path (tree) system for different types of graphs, including trees, grids, and maximal outerplanar graphs.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Composition of Elementary State Machines, with an Application to the Reversal of Cellular Automata Rule 90</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of a one-dimensional lattice of state machines on two states and two symbols sequentially updated via a process of "reflexive composition." The space of 256 machines exhibits a variety of behavior, including substitution, reversible "billiard ball" dynamics, and fractal nesting. We show that one machine generates the Sierpinski Triangle and, for a subset of boundary conditions, is isomorphic to cellular automata Rule 90 in Wolfram's naming scheme. More surprisingly, two other machines follow trajectories that map to Rule 90 in reverse. Whereas previous techniques have been developed to uncover preimages of Rule 90, this is the first study to produce such inverse dynamics naturally from the formalism itself. We argue that the system's symmetric treatment of state and message underlies its expressive power.</description>

      <title>A lattice on Dyck paths close to the Tamari lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new poset structure on Dyck paths where the covering relation is a particular case of the relation inducing the Tamari lattice. We prove that the transitive closure of this relation endows Dyck paths with a lattice structure. We provide a trivariate generating function counting the number of Dyck paths with respect to the semilength, the numbers of outgoing and incoming edges in the Hasse diagram. We deduce the numbers of coverings, meet and join irreducible elements. As a byproduct, we present a new involution on Dyck paths that transports the bistatistic of the numbers of outgoing and incoming edges into its reverse. Finally, we give a generating function for the number of intervals, and we compare this number with the number of intervals in the Tamari lattice.</description>

      <title>Pattern Avoidance for Fibonacci Sequences using $k$-Regular Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two $k$-ary Fibonacci recurrences are $a_k(n) = a_k(n-1) + k \cdot a_k(n-2)$ and $b_k(n) = k \cdot b_k(n-1) + b_k(n-2)$. We provide a simple proof that $a_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that avoid patterns $\{121, 123, 132, 213\}$ when using base cases $a_k(0) = a_k(1) = 1$ for any $k \geq 1$. This was previously proven by Kuba and Panholzer in the context of Wilf-equivalence for restricted Stirling permutations, and it creates Simion and Schmidt's classic result on the Fibonacci sequence when $k=1$, and the Jacobsthal sequence when $k=2$. We complement this theorem by proving that $b_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n]$ that avoid $\{122, 213\}$ with $b_k(0) = b_k(1) = 1$ for any~$k \geq 2$. Finally, we conjecture that $|Av^{2}_{n}(\underline{121}, 123, 132, 213)| = a_1(n)^2$ for $n \geq 0$. That is, vincularizing the Stirling pattern in Kuba and Panholzer's Jacobsthal result gives the Fibonacci-squared numbers.</description>

      <title>Local Constant Approximation for Dominating Set on Graphs Excluding Large Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that graphs excluding $K_{2,t}$ as a minor admit a $f(t)$-round $50$-approximation deterministic distributed algorithm for Minimum Dominating Set. The result extends to Minimum Vertex Cover. Though fast and approximate distributed algorithms for such problems were already known for $H$-minor-free graphs, all of them have an approximation ratio depending on the size of $H$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a large non-trivial excluded minor leading to fast and constant-approximation distributed algorithms, where the ratio is independent of the size of $H$. A new key ingredient in the analysis of these distributed algorithms is the use of asymptotic dimension.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Tur\'{a}n's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. According to Tur\'{a}n's theorem, if $G$ is $K_{r+1}$-free, then $m \leq |E(T(n, r))|,$ where $T(n, r)$ denotes the Tur\'{a}n graph on $n$ vertices with a maximum clique of order $r$. A limitation of this statement is that it does not give an expression in terms of $n$ and $r$. A widely used version of Tur\'{a}n's theorem states that for an $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}$-free graph, $m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r} \right\rfloor.$ Though this bound is often more convenient, it is not the same as the original statement. In particular, the class of extremal graphs for this bound, say $\mathcal{S}$, is a proper subset of the set of Tur\'{a}n graphs. In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the order of the largest clique that contains $v$. We show that \[ m \leq \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\right\rfloor\] Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in this bound. Interestingly, this class contains two extra non-Tur\'{a}n graphs other than the graphs in $\mathcal{S}$.</description>
