      <title>BEDCrypt: Privacy-preserving interval analytics with homomorphic encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation. Genomic data and derived interval datasets can carry sensitive information, and the analysis itself can reveal an analyst's intent. As genomic workloads are increasingly outsourced to third-party infrastructure, there is a need for privacy-preserving technologies that protect both the data and the queried loci. Results. We present BEDCrypt, a privacy-preserving system for genomic interval analytics based on homomorphic encryption in an honest-but-curious server setting. The server operates only on encrypted data and returns encrypted answers that the client decrypts locally, enabling core functionalities such as coverage summaries, interval intersections, proximity (window-style) queries, and set-similarity statistics, without revealing plaintext intervals or query genomic locations to the server.</description>

      <title>Effects of Training Data Quality on Classifier Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe extensive numerical experiments assessing and quantifying how classifier performance depends on the quality of the training data, a frequently neglected component of the analysis of classifiers.
  More specifically, in the scientific context of metagenomic assembly of short DNA reads into "contigs," we examine the effects of degrading the quality of the training data by multiple mechanisms, and for four classifiers -- Bayes classifiers, neural nets, partition models and random forests. We investigate both individual behavior and congruence among the classifiers. We find breakdown-like behavior that holds for all four classifiers, as degradation increases and they move from being mostly correct to only coincidentally correct, because they are wrong in the same way. In the process, a picture of spatial heterogeneity emerges: as the training data move farther from analysis data, classifier decisions degenerate, the boundary becomes less dense, and congruence increases.</description>

      <title>Extending Sequence Length is Not All You Need: Effective Integration of Multimodal Signals for Gene Expression Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene expression prediction, which predicts mRNA expression levels from DNA sequences, presents significant challenges. Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.</description>
