      <title>Excitonic Bose-polarons in electron-hole bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose polarons are mobile impurities dressed by density fluctuations of a surrounding degenerate Bose gas. These many-body objects have been realized in ultracold atomic gasses and become a subject of intensive studies. In this work, we show that excitons in electron-hole bilayers offer new opportunities for exploring polarons in strongly interacting, highly tunable bosonic systems. We found that Bose polarons are formed by spatially direct excitons immersed in degenerate Bose gases of spatially indirect excitons (IXs). We detected both attractive and repulsive Bose polarons by measuring photoluminescence excitation spectra. We controlled the density of IX Bose gas by optical excitation and observed an enhancement of the energy splitting between attractive and repulsive Bose polarons with increasing IX density, in agreement with our theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Photon-assisted tunneling resonantly controlling spin current of a spin-orbit-coupled atom in a toroidal trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic flashing potential has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating directed atomic currents. By applying the flashing ring-shaped potential to spin-orbit (SO) coupled, noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems, through photon-assisted tunneling (resonance) techniques, we demonstrate the generation of tunable alternating (AC) spin and atomic mass currents that can be precisely controlled in terms of direction and strength. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon is that the flashing potential supplies enough photons to induce Rabi oscillations and provides momentum transfer for spin and atomic transport. As the single-particle ground state of the unperturbed SO-coupled BEC depends on the Raman coupling strength, we demonstrate how to generate and control AC spin currents in the cases where the initial state resides in a single-well or double-well phase. In particular, we realize and explain the mechanism of generating a net AC spin current without mass current through single-photon resonance processes. It is shown that these interesting resonance phenomena can be analytically described only by the simple three-level model, which creates the possibility of transparent controls of spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which should be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes utilized by quantum-gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Phase driven exact and unconventional superradiance phase transition in non-Hermitian cascaded Rabi cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the phase driven symmetry breaking and exact and unconventional superradiance phase transition in the non-Hermitian cascaded Rabi cavities. The non-Hermiticity is introduced in the coupling phase (denoted by $\varphi$) between the atom and the optical field. The exactness refers to the fact that the superradiance phase boundary is obtained analytically and verified by the observables. The unconventionality is reflected in that when $|\varphi|=\frac{\pi}{4}$ or $|\varphi|=\frac{3\pi}{4}$, the phase boundary is uniquely determined by $\mathcal{J}=\frac{1}{2}$ (where $\mathcal{J}$ is the dimensionless cavity coupling strength) and is independent of the atom-optical field coupling strength $g$. For other $\varphi$, the phase boundary is determined by $\mathcal{J}$ and the dimensionless atom-optical field coupling strength $g$ together. Besides, we find that there are phase driven first-order and second-order superradiance phase transitions, and the quantum criticality for the second-order superradiance phase transition is studied. In addition, the experimental feasibility is discussed. This work will stimulate the studies of non-Hermitian superradiance quantum phase transitions and their experimental realizations, as well as the underlying universality class of phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometers provide a powerful tool for measuring physical constants and testifying fundamental physics with unprecedented precision. Conventional atom interferometry focuses on the phase difference between two paths and utilizes matter waves with fixed coherence. Here, we report on realizing a Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometer of coherent matter waves dressed by a moving optical lattice in the gravity direction, and explore the resulting interference along multiple paths with tunable coherence. We investigate spatial correlations of atoms both within the lattice and between two arms by interferometry, and observe the emerging multiple interference peaks owing to the long-range coherence nature of the Bose-Einstein condensate. Our findings agree well with theoretical simulations, paving the way for high-precision interferometry with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Observation of Continuous Time Crystal in a Spin Maser System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair interaction potentials between atoms in a crystal are in general non-monotonic in distance, with a local minimum whose position gives the lattice constant of the crystal. A temporal analogue of this idea of crystal formation is still pending despite intensive studies on the time crystal phase. In a hybrid spin maser system with a time delay feedback, we report the observation of a continuous time crystal induced by a retarded interaction with a characteristic time scale. This nonequilibrium phase features a self-sustained oscillation with an emergent frequency other than the intrinsic Larmor precession frequency of the spin maser system. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillation is robust against perturbation, while its time phase randomly distributes from 0 to $2\pi$ for different realizations, a signature of spontaneous continuous time translation symmetry breaking. This CTC phase emerges only when the feedback strength exceeds a critical value, at which the system experiences a first order phase transition. Such a retarded interaction induced CTC is closer to the original idea of crystal, compared to mechanisms in other time crystal proposals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with light particle mass and weak particle-particle interaction can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons can be naturally bound to the surface of a QLS in a vacuum and exhibit unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. In this article, we review the historical study and recent progress in this area. The main topics covered in this review include the collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen, the theoretical proposal and experimental effort toward single electron qubits on superfluid helium, the recent experimental realization of single electron charge qubits on solid neon and the related theoretical calculation. In the end, we review and envision extended exploration of quantum electronics on heterogeneous QLS.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Hubbard-Mott excitons and their ro-vibrational excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hubbard excitons are bound states of doublons and holes that can be experimentally probed both in real materials, such as cuprates, and in cold atom quantum simulators. Here we compare properties of a Hubbard exciton to those of a pair of distinguishable dopants in the $t-J$ model and show how insights into pair properties can be obtained through excitonic spectra. In particular, we perform large-scale numerical simulations of spectral functions and optical conductivities and obtain remarkable agreement between Hubbard excitons and pairs of distinguishable dopants. The latter can be decomposed into symmetric (bosonic) and anti-symmetric (fermionic) sectors of indistinguishable dopants, thus enabling a detailed understanding of different features observed in the excitonic spectra through comparison with a semi-analytical geometric string theory approach. We further compare theoretically computed exciton spectra in a single band Fermi-Hubbard model to resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) studies of the parent insulating cuprate materials. We find remarkable agreement between the two spectra in both energy and momentum dependence. Our analysis suggests that multiple long-lived ro-vibrational exciton resonances have been observed in RIXS spectra. Experimentally, these features are known to persist up to optimal doping. The comparison we provide between semi-analytical theory, large-scale numerics, and experimental data thus provides an explanation of the RIXS measurements and provides new insight into the nature of pairing in cuprates.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Fermi polaron after a kick: two-sided singularity of the momentum distribution, Bragg reflection and other exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mobile impurity particle immersed in a quantum fluid forms a polaron - a quasiparticle consisting of the impurity and a local disturbance of the fluid around it. We ask what happens to a one-dimensional polaron after a kick, i.e. an abrupt application of a force that instantly delivers a finite impulse to the impurity. In the framework of an integrable model describing an impurity in a one-dimensional gas of fermions or hard-core bosons, we calculate the distribution of the polaron momentum established when the post-kick relaxation is over. A remarkable feature of this distribution is a two-sided power-law singularity. It emerges due to one of two processes. In the first process, the whole impulse is transferred to the polaron, without creating phonon-like excitations of the fluid. In the second process, the impulse is shared between the polaron and the center-of-mass motion of the fluid, again without creating any fluid excitations. The latter process is, in fact, a Bragg reflection at the edge of the emergent Brillouin zone. We carefully analyze the conditions for each of the two processes. The asymptotic form of the distribution in the vicinity of the singularity is derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an optomechanical formalism for macroscopic quantum states in exciton-polariton systems with strong exciton-phonon interactions. We show that polariton optomechanical interactions induce dynamical backaction, resulting in dispersive and dissipative shifts in the complex vibrational response functions. Unlike conventional optomechanical systems, polariton optomechanics features high-dimensionality and phase-space confinement due to the dispersion relations of exciton-polaritons. Consequently, vibrational modes exhibit effective positive or negative mass depending on the detuning parameter, and are capable for the vibrational Bose-Einstein condensation under the resonant conditions [arXiv:2309.08498]. We demonstrate the potential for vibrational control of polariton condensates at room temperature.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Moir\'e Systems in Twisted Bilayer Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e related physics in twisted bilayer two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted widespread interest in condensed matter physics. Simulation of moir\'e related physics in cold atom platform is expected to outperform the 2D materials thanks to its advantage of higher tunablility. Here, we point out, the cold atom platform enables a new mechanism of moir\'e lattice formation, with intrinsic "dynamical" character arising from interlayer interaction, in contrast to conventional moir\'e lattice induced by "static" ways such as single-particle interlayer tunneling or external controls. Specifically, we consider a twisted bilayer Bose-Hubbard model with vanishing interlayer tunneling, and the bilayer is solely coupled through interlayer interaction that originates from contact interaction of atoms. We find that this system hosts a plethora of novel phases unique to this dynamical lattice, including a variety of Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases either preserving or breaking moir\'e lattice symmetry, phases with one layer in SF and the other in MI, "interlocked" MI, and self-localized phases at commensurate twist angles, which exhibits the characteristics of Bose glass and quasi-many-body localization in the absence of (quasi)disorder or quasicrystalline lattices. Our prediction can be readily observed in current experimental setup of twisted bilayer optical lattices, opening up new avenues for exploring the rich physics of dynamical moir\'e systems in cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories involve dynamics of typically short-ranged interacting particles and dynamical fields. Elimination of the latter via Gauss law leads to infinite range interactions as exemplified by the Schwinger model in a staggered formalism. This motivates the study of long-range interactions, not necessarily diminishing with the distance. Here we consider localization properties of a spin chain with interaction strength growing linearly along the chain as for the Schwinger model. We generalize the problem to models with different interaction ranges. Using exact diagonalization we find the participation ratio of all eigenstates, which allows us to quantify the localization volume in Hilbert space. Surprisingly, the localization volume changes nonmonotonically with the interaction range. Our study is relevant for quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories implemented in state-of-the-art cold atom/ion devices, and it could help to reveal hidden features in disorder-free confinement phenomena in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Entangled multiplets, asymmetry, and quantum Mpemba effect in dissipative systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the entanglement asymmetry emerged as an informative tool to understand dynamical symmetry restoration in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems after a quantum quench. For integrable systems the asymmetry can be understood in the space-time scaling limit via the quasiparticle picture, as it was pointed out in Ref. [1]. However, a quasiparticle picture for quantum quenches from generic initial states was still lacking. Here we conjecture a full-fledged quasiparticle picture for the charged moments of the reduced density matrix, which are the main ingredients to construct the asymmetry. Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in [2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times. Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of the condition for the QME.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic polarizability of Dy at 532 nm on the intercombination transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report experimental measurements of the dynamical polarizability of dysprosium, at a wavelength of 532 nm. We measure all three components (scalar, vector, tensor) of the anisotropic polarizability for the ground and the excited manifolds of the intercombination transition of Dy at 626 nm. The apparatus on which the measurements are performed is first presented. We obtain with this setup imaging of single Dy atoms with fidelity above 99 % and losses below 2.5 % induced by imaging. We then describe the methods used to extract the polarizability. In particular, we combine a measurement of trap frequency and trap depth on single atoms in optical tweezers, allowing us to obtain a measurement of the ground state polarizability free of errors in trap waist calibration. The obtained values give a magic condition between two Zeeman states in the ground and excited manifolds, which was used to image single atoms in optical tweezer arrays. The scalar polarizability of the ground state is in disagreement with theoretical expectations, calling for future investigations to resolve the discrepancy.</description>
