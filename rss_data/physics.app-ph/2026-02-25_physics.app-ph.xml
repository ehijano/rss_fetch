      <title>Machine learning-enabled inverse design of bimaterial thermoelastic lattice metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermoelastic metamaterial based on a bimaterial hybrid-honeycomb structure, exhibiting simultaneously negative Poisson's ratios and negative thermal expansion coefficients is very promising for various application. This work is dedicated to the machine learning (ML)-enabled inverse design of such structure, on the basis of high-throughput simulation and neural network models. A large dataset is generated through computational homogenization of structures with varying geometrical features and base material properties. A forward ML model is first trained to efficiently and accurately predict the effective thermoelastic properties for a given structure design. Subsequently, inverse ML models are developed to suggest geometrical features and base materials for desired target properties. To address various inverse design scenarios, six different models are proposed, each defined by different combinations of target effective properties and structural design variables. The trained forward model is integrated into the loss functions of the inverse models and is also employed to generate additional datasets for cases with fixed base materials. The good predictive performance of the forward and inverse ML models is demonstrated by representative design examples. These ML models can be applied to efficiently solving specific inverse design tasks involved in the practical application of the thermoelastic metamaterial in novel engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Toward a CMOS-integrated quantum diamond biosensor based on NV centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report progress toward a CMOS-integrated quantum diamond biosensing platform that combines nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with a custom 40 nm CMOS Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array. The system integrates on-chip active quenching and digital readout with external FPGA-based photon counting, compact microwave delivery, and practical optical excitation and collection schemes to support widefield optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). System-level design considerations spanning fluorescence collection efficiency, detector count-rate capability, and microwave homogeneity are analyzed with biological compatibility and scalability in mind. Using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION)-labeled HEK293T cells as a representative use case, simple dipole-field estimates indicate that sub-$\mu$T sensitivity is required to resolve ODMR shifts within typical ensemble linewidths. Based on the proposed architecture and efficiency analysis, a magnetic field sensitivity of approximately 90 nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ per pixel is estimated. These results outline a practical path from optics-heavy quantum diamond microscopes toward compact, CMOS-integrated NV-based biosensors for quantitative magnetic imaging in complex biological environments.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional wave energy gimbal-based electromagnetic generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave energy, as a renewable energy source, is widely distributed and possesses substantial reserves. However, many existing wave energy harvesters exhibit motion constraints under irregular wave conditions, which limits their energy conversion efficiency. In this study, an omnidirectional wave energy gimbal-based electromagnetic generator (OWG-EMG) is proposed to achieve stable power generation under irregular wave motions. By integrating a three-axis gimbal mechanism with an inertial mass regulator, the proposed harvester effectively converts complex and varying wave-induced motions into relative rotational motion between gimbal frames. A planetary gear transmission is further employed to increase the rotational speed of the electromagnetic generator, enabling efficient omnidirectional wave energy harvesting. Experimental results demonstrate that the device delivers an average output power of up to 0.24 W at a frequency of 1 Hz, corresponding to an average power density of 40 W/m3. Importantly, in addition to its high energy conversion efficiency, the proposed device offers notable advantages including low cost, structural simplicity, and high reliability, highlighting its significant potential for applications in ocean energy harvesting and utilization.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Laboratory Agent via Customized Domain-Specific Language Model and Modular AI Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a system architecture that addresses a fundamental challenge in deploying language-model agents for autonomous control of scientific instrumentation: ensuring reliability in safety-critical environments. The framework integrates probabilistic reasoning by domain-specialized language models with deterministic execution layers that enforce constraints through structured validation and modular orchestration. By separating intent interpretation, experimental planning, and command verification, the architecture translates high-level scientific goals into verifiable experimental actions. We demonstrate this approach in real-time atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy experiments operated at room temperature, where the system autonomously generates control strategies, invokes corrective modules, and maintains stable operation under experimentally challenging conditions. Quantitative evaluations show that domain-adapted small language models achieve high routing robustness and command accuracy while operating on consumer-grade hardware. Beyond a specific instrument, the framework establishes a general computational principle for deploying language-model agents in safety-critical experimental workflows, providing a pathway toward scalable autonomous laboratories.</description>

      <title>Resonant attenuation of surface acoustic waves by a weakly bonded layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in a layered half-space system comprising a continuous, sub-wavelength-thick layer weakly adhering to a substrate. Using finite element simulations, we demonstrate that this configuration - without requiring surface structuration - gives rise to frequency ranges bounded in k-space and characterized by strong SAW attenuation, which we term adhesion-induced resonant attenuation zones. We show that these attenuation zones closely mimic the resonant behavior typically observed in locally resonant metamaterials and can be understood through a mass-spring analogy, where the adhesion between the layer and substrate governs the frequency and width of the attenuation zones. As a practical demonstration, we propose a bilayer configuration as a practical route to experimentally realize adhesion-induced resonant attenuation of SAWs, where a soft and thin interfacial film serves as an intermediate adhesive bonding between the layer and substrate, providing a realistic and tunable interfacial stiffness. Our findings offer a simplified route to achieving SAW manipulation through continuous layered media with tunable adhesion, providing a practical alternative to complex structural designs in SAW-based devices across a broad frequency range.</description>

      <title>Enabling FR2-5G Communication with Dielectric OAM Transmitarrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of near-field (NF) indoor communications in the FR2 frequency bands using fully dielectric structures to generate orbital angular momentum (OAM) waves. All-dielectric platforms based on distributions of T-shaped unit cells are employed for this purpose. The unit cell design is based on a circuital approach and analytical formulations, where phase shifts necessary for OAM generation are achieved by varying the dielectric-to-air ratio within the structure. Based on this unit cell, a set of transmitarrays (TAs) are designed to produce specific OAM modes. These TAs are fabricated in-house using stereolithographic 3D printing and experimentally tested. The tests evaluate two key features of OAM beams: the orthogonality of distinct vortex modes, as characterized by their electric field distributions, and their object-avoidance capability, enabled by the central null characteristic of the wavefront. In addition, a field-test within an indoor environment is conducted emulating a real wireless system. A bit error rate lower than 10\textsuperscript{$-$6} is observed for solidary modes in Tx and Rx, whereas orthogonal modes produces an increment in 4 order of magnitude. The obtained results reveals that the prototype is suitable for short-range scenarios, enabling techniques such as OAM-multiplexation or physical-layer security thanks to the effective orthogonality beteween modes.</description>

      <title>LED-based multibeam photoacoustics combined with electrical circuit-based modeling for the analysis of multispecies mass transport through thin membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops photoacoustic-based experimental methods for comprehensive characterization of multispecies mass transport from donor compartments to thin-membrane acceptor systems in perfect contact, supported by a dedicated mass transfer modeling framework. Multibeam configurations are implemented in photoacoustic setups operating in front-side detection and diffuse-reflection geometries. The setups are calibrated and adjusted prior to measurements by means of transmission-mode photoacoustic experiments conducted under steady-state conditions. Finally, the methodologies were applied to a model system undergoing photoinduced decay, enabling characterization of bulk transport kinetics as well as interfacial equilibration monitored through time-dependent changes in interfacial reflectivity. For the analysis of bulk transport data, a lumped electrical-circuit (EC) model is introduced. The model is formulated in tableau form, linking species population dynamics to an interaction matrix representing mass-transport couplings consistent with the underlying diffusion-reaction framework. A simplified approximation of the model is further proposed and validated against experimental results. The combined experimental-modeling framework provides an effective approach for quantitative analysis of coupled diffusion, reaction, and interfacial processes in thin-membrane systems.</description>

      <title>Graded anisotropic metamaterials for elastic wave mode conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient transmission of elastic waves across interfaces is central to several applications, including medical imaging, seismic isolation, and transducer design. Interfaces with abrupt changes in the material properties significantly impede wave transmission, leading to reflections. This limitation, known as impedance mismatch, becomes even more prominent for mode conversion between different wave types due to polarization mismatch. In this study, we investigate a mechanism employing two-dimensional functionally graded anisotropic metamaterials to facilitate longitudinal--shear mode conversion as waves propagate from a stiff to a compliant medium. By embedding density and anisotropic shape gradients within the functionally graded metamaterial, polarization-induced impedance mismatch is mitigated and efficient mode conversion is enabled. We use unit cell dispersion analysis to tailor the frequency range for mode conversion through gradation in the dispersion behavior and coupling between modes. Using frequency-domain finite element analysis, we demonstrate broadband mode conversion across interfaces with large stiffness contrast operating in the 1--10 kHz range. We then experimentally validate and quantify mode conversion through full-field velocity measurements on an additively manufactured specimen. We further apply the methodology to design a device capable of converting radial--tangential wave modes.</description>

      <title>Operational Accelerator Tuning via Model-Coupled Optics and Bayesian Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an on-line tuning strategy for the ISAC post-accelerator that pre-sets machine optics with a digital twin and then performs Bayesian optimization for steering under online operation with beam. The model computes end-to-end tunes in seconds and interfaces with the control system under device bounds, slew-rate limits, and loss interlocks. We report three experimental case studies demonstrating that decoupling optics from steering yields faster and more reliable convergence than a fully Bayesian optics-plus-steering baseline under identical conditions. Across these cases, iterations to high transmission tunes are reduced by a factor of 4-6, with final average transmissions in the mid- to high-90% range. By factorizing optics from steering, the dimensionality of the parameter space is reduced, convergence becomes more predictable, and operational safeguards are easier to enforce.</description>

      <title>DC-to-GHz Modulation In Microring Modulators Using Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystal-on-Silicon in a Foundry Photonic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) platforms exhibit exceptional electro-optic (EO) properties, including high-speed operation, low energy consumption, and compact footprints. However, the absence of a scalable poling method for EO polymers, combined with the slow switching speeds characteristic of liquid crystals, has impeded the integration and compatibility of these materials with commercial silicon photonic foundries. On the other hand, the realization of very-large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the native silicon photonics platform itself is impeded by the complexities associated with the wavelength and thermal stabilization for microring modulators (MRMs). This study establishes the foundation for a poling-free, CMOS-compatible SOH MRM platform by exploiting simultaneous AC phase shifts in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FN-LCs). We present the first demonstration of an MRM coated with FN-LC, with both the RF signal and the DC bias applied to the same electrodes, taking advantage of the dual phase shift uniquely available in FN-LC. An EO bandwidth of f$_{-6dB}\approx$ 7.8 GHz is achieved \textendash~ the highest reported value for an SOH MRM to date. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an approximately linear resonance shift across the full width at half maximum ($\approx$ 150 pm/V), with a static power efficiency of $\approx$ 4.5 nW/$\pi$ for an MRM occupying a total footprint of $\approx$ 0.084 mm$^2$ and exhibiting an on-chip optical insertion loss of $\approx$ 0.78 dB. Successful infiltration of FN-LC, selectively patterned on top of phase shifters, along with optical input/output channels established using free-form photonic wire bonds, is demonstrated in the proposed PIC.</description>

      <title>Propagation of elastic waves in a flexomagnetic solid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexomagnetism is the coupling between magnetism and strain gradients and is a technologically relevant phenomenon. We present a theory of elastic wave propagation in a linear elastic flexomagnetic material with microstructure and strain gradient elastic interactions. The expressions of frequency, phase velocity, and group velocity of longitudinal and transverse waves are derived and are shown to depend on the flexomagnetic coefficient and microstructure. We also show that the effect of flexomagnetism and microstructure can lead to some interesting phenomena in wave propagation, which are not observed in classical linear elasticity theory of waves. Specifically, in contrast to classical linear elastic materials, where wave propagation is non-dispersive, flexomagnetic materials with microstructure can exhibit both normal and abnormal dispersion. It is also noteworthy that, in flexomagnetic materials with gradient elasticity, the phase velocities of transverse waves can exceed those of longitudinal waves, which is atypical in classical elasticity. Furthermore, waves can also attenuate for a certain range of wavenumbers that depend on the flexomagnetic coefficient and microstructural parameters. Finally, we explore the possibility of waves exhibiting zero group velocity modes, where waves are non-propagating but have strong local energy confinement, negative group velocity modes, where the wave packet moves in the opposite direction to that of wave propagation, and the phenomenon of wave freezing, where a propagating wave stops in space without diffusing or spreading.</description>

      <title>Enhancing FRET through DNA-controlled Emitters and ENZ Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to significantly enhance energy transfer processes at the nanoscale requires the simultaneous optimization of molecular scale orientation and macroscopic photonic enhancement between multiple quantum emitters. However, achieving this dual control has remained a significant experimental challenge, often limited by the stochastic arrangement of emitter assemblies and spatially non-uniform electromagnetic fields in conventional photonic platforms. In this work, we demonstrate a unified architecture that achieves this synergy by combining the structural precision of DNA nanotechnology with the unique field environment generated by epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Using DNA molecular beacons as programmable emitter scaffolds, we establish fixed donor-acceptor separations and emitter orientations (Atto425/Cy3.5) in two well-defined conformational states: closed hairpin (emitter separation 2 nm), and open extended (7.2 nm) configurations. These structures are then embedded in the near-field of a multilayer ENZ metamaterial substrate, which facilitates spatially uniform, enhanced electromagnetic field coupling. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrate a significant increase in FRET efficiency for DNA-programmed emitter pairs in the ENZ environment, compared to those on a glass substrate, corresponding to increased donor quenching and shortened donor lifetime. These results establish a scalable experimental pathway for engineering light-matter interactions at molecular scales, enabled by the structural precision of DNA paired with ENZ mediated redistribution of the local density of optical states (LDOS) to amplify near-filed coupling between quantum emitters, with applications in next-generation bio-sensing and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic building blocks of many forms of optical topologies are particle-like singularities in phase and polarisation, giving rise to lines of darkness that weave complex threads in 3D space. Although known for half a century since seminal work on dislocations in wave trains, their behaviour in complex media remains under debate, especially with respect to their relative stability. Here we show that polarisation and phase vortices behave identically in one-sided turbulent complex channels. We perform complementary numerical and experimental studies using atmospheric turbulence as a test case, demonstrating agreement and equivalent dynamics.
