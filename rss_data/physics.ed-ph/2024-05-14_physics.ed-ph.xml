      <title>Exploring Motion: Integrating Arduino in Physics Education for 21st Century Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study, analyzes were made for one-dimensional constant acceleration motion using the Arduino microcontroller and distance sensor, using the position and time values obtained for the movement of an object thrown from bottom to top until it falls to the ground. Within the scope of the study, the concepts of displacement, distance traveled, average speed and their relationships, position-time and speed-time graphs and kinematic equations were analyzed respectively. It was observed that all the results obtained from the analyzes were compatible with the theoretical results obtained using the equations. This study, in which innovative experimental activities and comprehensive analyzes for both constant acceleration motion and motion graphs and flight movements are carried out at a very low cost, has a high reproducibility potential as it contains easily accessible materials. With this type of study, it is very important and necessary to add training for 21st century skills such as material development, programming, and data analysis to physics teaching processes in the age of technology.</description>
