      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Method for Metal Artifact-Resistant Syn-MP-RAGE Contrast Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain brain volumetric studies, synthetic T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) contrast, derived from quantitative T1 MRI (T1-qMRI), proves highly valuable due to its clear white/gray matter boundaries for brain segmentation. However, generating synthetic MP-RAGE (syn-MP-RAGE) typically requires pairs of high-quality, artifact-free, multi-modality inputs, which can be challenging in retrospective studies, where missing or corrupted data is common. To overcome this limitation, our research explores the feasibility of employing a deep learning-based approach to synthesize syn-MP-RAGE contrast directly from a single channel turbo spin-echo (TSE) input, renowned for its resistance to metal artifacts. We evaluated this deep learning-based synthetic MP-RAGE (DL-Syn-MPR) on 31 non-artifact and 11 metal-artifact subjects. The segmentation results, measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), consistently achieved high agreement (DSC values above 0.83), indicating a strong correlation with reference segmentations, with lower input requirements. Also, no significant difference in segmentation performance was observed between the artifact and non-artifact groups.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Glucose Enhanced Imaging using Direct Water Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) MRI studies employ chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) or spin lock (CESL) to study glucose uptake. Currently, these methods are hampered by low effect size and sensitivity to motion. To overcome this, we propose to utilize exchange-based linewidth (LW) broadening of the direct water saturation (DS) curve of the water saturation spectrum (Z-spectrum) during and after glucose infusion (DS-DGE MRI). Methods: To estimate the glucose-infusion-induced LW changes ($\Delta$LW), Bloch-McConnell simulations were performed for normoglycemia and hyperglycemia in blood, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), CSF, and malignant tumor tissue. Whole-brain DS-DGE imaging was implemented at 3 tesla using dynamic Z-spectral acquisitions (1.2 s per offset frequency, 38 s per spectrum) and assessed on four brain tumor patients using infusion of 35 g of D-glucose. To assess $\Delta$LW, a deep learning-based Lorentzian fitting approach was employed on voxel-based DS spectra acquired before, during, and post-infusion. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) images, obtained from the dynamic $\Delta$LW time curves, were compared qualitatively to perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI). Results: In simulations, $\Delta$LW was 1.3%, 0.30%, 0.29/0.34%, 7.5%, and 13% in arterial blood, venous blood, GM/WM, malignant tumor tissue, and CSF, respectively. In vivo, $\Delta$LW was approximately 1% in GM/WM, 5-20% for different tumor types, and 40% in CSF. The resulting DS-DGE AUC maps clearly outlined lesion areas. Conclusions: DS-DGE MRI is highly promising for assessing D-glucose uptake. Initial results in brain tumor patients show high-quality AUC maps of glucose-induced line broadening and DGE-based lesion enhancement similar and/or complementary to PWI.</description>

      <title>Automated neuroradiological support systems for multiple cerebrovascular disease markers -- A systematic review and meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) can lead to stroke and dementia. Stroke is the second leading cause of death world wide and dementia incidence is increasing by the year. There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain imaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), acute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain atrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management and intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and dementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to support radiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We considered commercially available software and research publications which identify at least two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13 research publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system were available: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic and ischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose of patient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally and longitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequently analysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVS were each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commercially available systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst research systems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMH and atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVD markers are also of significance. There are currently no openly validated systems, commercially, or in research, performing a comprehensive joint analysis of all CVD markers (WMH, ISL, lacunes, PVS, haemorrhagic lesions, CMB, and atrophy).</description>

      <title>Orientation independent quantification of macromolecular proton fraction in tissues with suppression of residual dipolar coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative magnetization transfer (MT) imaging enables non-invasive characterization of the macromolecular environment of tissues. However, recent work has highlighted that the quantification of MT parameters exhibits orientation dependence in ordered tissue structures, potentially confounding its clinical applications. Notably, in tissues with ordered structures, such as articular cartilage and myelin, the residual dipolar coupling (RDC) effect can arise owing to incomplete averaging of dipolar-dipolar interactions of water protons. In this study, we demonstrated the confounding effect of RDC on quantitative MT imaging in ordered tissues can be suppressed by using an emerging technique known as macromolecular proton fraction mapping based on spin-lock (MPF-SL). The off-resonance spin-lock pulse in MPF-SL could be designed to generate a strong effective spin-lock field to suppress RDC without violating the specific absorption rate and hardware limitations in clinical scans. Furthermore, removing the water signal in MPF-SL enabled the application of a strong effective spin-lock field without any confounding signal from direct water saturation. Our findings were experimentally validated using human knee specimens and healthy human cartilage. The results demonstrated that MPF-SL exhibits lower sensitivity to tissue orientation compared with R2, R1rho, and saturation-pulse-based MT imaging. Thus, MPF-SL could serve as a valuable orientation-independent technique for quantifying MPF.</description>
