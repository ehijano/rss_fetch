      <title>Effect of Burn Parameters on PAH Emissions at Conditions Relevant for Prescribed Fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfire smoke is a health hazard as it contains a mixture of carcinogenic volatile compounds and fine particulate matter. In particular, exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a major concern, since these compounds have been recognized as important contributors to the overall carcinogenic risk of smoke exposure. In this work, gas and particle-phase PAH emissions from the combustion of Eastern White Pine (pinus strobus) were quantified using time-of-flight mass spectrometry over a range of burn conditions representative of wildfires and prescribed fires. These experiments allow for controlling conditions of fuel moisture, heat flux, and oxygen concentration to understand their impact on PAH emissions. We find that optimal conditions for fuel moisture content of 20 - 30%, heat load onto the sample of 60 - 70 kW/m$^2$, and oxygen concentrations of the burn environment of 5 - 15% can reduce the emissions of the heavy molar weight PAHs by up to 77%. Our analysis shows that the relative carcinogenic risk can be reduced by more than 50% under optimal conditions, offering a way for reducing emission exposure from forest treatment activities.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal theoretical model of instabilities in swirling flows occurring in nature or industrial processes is developed. This model encompasses various open and confined flows including spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow, which results from the combination of differential rotation and baroclinic convection due to radial heating and natural gravity. Utilizing short-wavelength local analysis, the model generalizes previous results from numerical simulations and linear stability analysis of specific flows. A general criterion for instability is derived, incorporating viscous dissipation and thermal diffusion, thereby extending and uniting existing criteria (Rayleigh for centrifugally-driven flows, L\"udwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson for isothermal spiraling flows, and Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke for non-isothermal azimuthal flows).</description>

      <title>Distributed Instruments for Planetary Surface Science: Scientific Opportunities and Technology Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we assess the scientific promise and technology feasibility of distributed instruments for planetary science. A distributed instrument is an instrument designed to collect spatially and temporally correlated data from multiple networked, geographically distributed point sensors. Distributed instruments are ubiquitous in Earth science, where they are routinely employed for weather and climate science, seismic studies and resource prospecting, and detection of industrial emissions. However, to date, their adoption in planetary surface science has been minimal. It is natural to ask whether this lack of adoption is driven by low potential to address high-priority questions in planetary science; immature technology; or both. To address this question, we survey high-priority planetary science questions that are uniquely well-suited to distributed instruments. We identify four areas of research where distributed instruments hold promise to unlock answers that are largely inaccessible to monolithic sensors, namely, weather and climate studies of Mars; localization of seismic events on rocky and icy bodies; localization of trace gas emissions, primarily on Mars; and magnetometry studies of internal composition. Next, we survey enabling technologies for distributed sensors and assess their maturity. We identify sensor placement (including descent and landing on planetary surfaces), power, and instrument autonomy as three key areas requiring further investment to enable future distributed instruments. Overall, this work shows that distributed instruments hold great promise for planetary science, and paves the way for follow-on studies of future distributed instruments for Solar System in-situ science.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model for Generating Ensembles of Climate Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate estimates of uncertainty in climate scenarios often requires generating large ensembles of high-resolution climate simulations, a computationally expensive and memory intensive process. To address this challenge, we train a novel generative deep learning approach on extensive sets of climate simulations. The model consists of two components: a variational autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model that generates multiple ensemble members. We validate our model on the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble and show that it achieves good agreement with the original ensemble in terms of variability. By leveraging the latent space representation, our model can rapidly generate large ensembles on-the-fly with minimal memory requirements, which can significantly improve the efficiency of uncertainty quantification in climate simulations.</description>

      <title>GPTCast: a weather language model for precipitation nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces GPTCast, a generative deep-learning method for ensemble nowcast of radar-based precipitation, inspired by advancements in large language models (LLMs). We employ a GPT model as a forecaster to learn spatiotemporal precipitation dynamics using tokenized radar images. The tokenizer is based on a Quantized Variational Autoencoder featuring a novel reconstruction loss tailored for the skewed distribution of precipitation that promotes faithful reconstruction of high rainfall rates. The approach produces realistic ensemble forecasts and provides probabilistic outputs with accurate uncertainty estimation. The model is trained without resorting to randomness, all variability is learned solely from the data and exposed by model at inference for ensemble generation. We train and test GPTCast using a 6-year radar dataset over the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy, showing superior results compared to state-of-the-art ensemble extrapolation methods.</description>

      <title>Estimation of AMOC transition probabilities using a machine learning based rare-event algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is an important component of the global climate, known to be a tipping element, as it could collapse under global warming. The main objective of this study is to compute the probability that the AMOC collapses within a specified time window, using a rare-event algorithm called Trajectory-Adaptive Multilevel Splitting (TAMS). However, the efficiency and accuracy of TAMS depend on the choice of the score function. Although the definition of the optimal score function, called ``committor function" is known, it is impossible in general to compute it a priori. Here, we combine TAMS with a Next-Generation Reservoir Computing technique that estimates the committor function from the data generated by the rare-event algorithm. We test this technique in a stochastic box model of the AMOC for which two types of transition exist, the so-called F(ast)-transitions and S(low)-transitions. Results for the F-transtions compare favorably with those in the literature where a physically-informed score function was used. We show that coupling a rare-event algorithm with machine learning allows for a correct estimation of transition probabilities, transition times, and even transition paths for a wide range of model parameters. We then extend these results to the more difficult problem of S-transitions in the same model. In both cases of F-transitions and S-transitions, we also show how the Next-Generation Reservoir Computing technique can be interpreted to retrieve an analytical estimate of the committor function.</description>
