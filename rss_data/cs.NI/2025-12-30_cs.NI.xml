      <title>Impact of Sociality Regimes on Quality of Service and Energy Efficiency in Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell-free architecture represents a significant advancement in network design, where each User Equipment (UE) is served by a group of distributed Access Points (APs), aimed at delivering uniformly high data rates to UEs across all locations. To ensure network scalability, user-centric clustering (UCC) has emerged as a practical approach, wherein only a selected subset of preferred APs jointly serves each UE. Forming the optimal cluster of APs for each UE is a challenging task, particularly when limited fronthaul and processing capabilities of both APs and UEs are considered. This challenge is exacerbated by the need for dynamic adjustments to enhance energy efficiency while meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements, which introduces conflicting interests between these entities. In this paper, we investigate the sociality regime of UEs and their clusters of APs, characterizing their intra-team cooperation as either selfish, egalitarian, or altruistic. These sociality regimes are crucial in achieving a balance between QoS and energy efficiency per UE. We address this problem by modeling it as a many-to-many social matching game with externalities, where connections can be established based on the sociality regime of both teams. To solve this, we introduce two novel algorithms based on Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Early Acceptance (EA) matching games. Numerical results show the significant impact of the sociality regime adopted by UEs and their clusters of APs on UE's QoS satisfaction and energy efficiency, with the egalitarian regime adopted by both entities proving the best performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Coordinate-Conditioned Diffusion Approach for 6G C-V2X Radio Environment Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmitter vehicles that broadcast 6G Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)-based messages, e.g., Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), are prone to be impacted by PHY issues due to the lack of dynamic high-fidelity Radio Environment Map (REM) with dynamic location variation. This paper explores a lightweight diffusion-based generative approach, the Coordinate-Conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CCDDPM), that leverages the signal intensity-based 6G V2X Radio Environment Map (REM) from limited historical transmitter vehicles in a specific region, to predict the REMs for a transmitter vehicle with arbitrary coordinates across the same region. The transmitter vehicle coordinate is encoded as a smooth Gaussian prior and fused with the Gaussian noise through a lightweight two-channel conditional U-Net architecture. We demonstrate that the predicted REM closely matches the statistics and structure of ground-truth REM while exhibiting the improved stability and over other widely applied generative AI approaches. The resulting predictor enables rapid and scenario-consistent REM with arbitrary transmitter coordinates, which thereby supports more efficient 6G C-V2X communications where transmitter vehicles are less likely to suffer from the PHY issues.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach for a Smart IoMT-Based BAN for an Old Home Healthcare Monitoring System Using Starlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology has become a transformative force in modern healthcare, particularly in elderly patient management. The current elderly care system faces significant challenges, including insufficient long-term care resources and poor communication between healthcare providers. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel Starlink-assisted IOMT-based elderly healthcare model designed to improve remote patient monitoring and communication reliability. This proposal system focused on a monitoring system of key biomedical parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, heart attack indicators, and a fall detection alert system. Performance is evaluated using the network simulator (NS-3) to assess its effectiveness in remote and underserved regions. Physiological data collected from patients are transmitted through a local communication hub and forwarded over a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite link to a medical center. Based on Quality of Service (QoS) technology that combines Flow Queuing (FQ) with Controlled Delay (CoDel) with Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) marking. This approach prioritizes critical health data for faster transmission while allocating lower priority to non-urgent information. This architecture is entirely wireless, allowing continuous monitoring, real-time alerts, and secure data storage for medical analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Starlink-enabled IOMT system outperforms existing solutions in terms of throughput, latency, and reliability. The findings highlight Starlink's potential as a robust and high-performance telehealth communication tool. In addition, this study provides a scalable and reproducible framework for future satellite-assisted healthcare systems that prioritize quality of service (QoS) performance and improved elderly patient care.</description>

      <title>Cyber Resilience in Next-Generation Networks: Threat Landscape, Theoretical Foundations, and Design Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of networked systems, driven by innovations in software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), open radio access networks (O-RAN), and cloud-native architectures, is redefining both the operational landscape and the threat surface of critical infrastructures. This book offers an in-depth, interdisciplinary examination of how resilience must be re-conceptualized and re-engineered to address the multifaceted challenges posed by these transformations.
  Structured across six chapters, this book begins by surveying the contemporary risk landscape, identifying emerging cyber, physical, and AI-driven threats, and analyzing their implications for scalable, heterogeneous network environments. It then establishes rigorous definitions and evaluation frameworks for resilience, going beyond robustness and fault-tolerance to address adaptive, anticipatory, and retrospective mechanisms across diverse application domains.
  The core of the book delves into advanced paradigms and practical strategies for resilience, including zero trust architectures, game-theoretic threat modeling, and self-healing design principles. A significant portion is devoted to the role of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs), in enabling dynamic threat response, autonomous network control, and multi-agent coordination under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decision Mamba Meets Agentic AI: A Novel Approach for RAN Slicing in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.</description>

      <title>Distributed Accountability in Democracy: Using MANETs and DTNs in the Face of Acts of Questionable Legality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the behavior of the Epidemic and Wave DTN routing protocols in a realistic setting where individuals may wish to communicate with others for support regarding an act of questionable legality. We identify situations where using the Epidemic routing protocol may be more advantageous in such a scenario, and situations where using the Wave routing protocol may be more advantageous instead. We discuss other aspects of our findings in detail and suggest multiple approaches to future works.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Mega-Constellation Links for LEO Missions With Applications to EO and ISS Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite missions demand ever greater connectivity, especially in the LEO regime. In this paper, we introduce the new mega-constellation services in space paradigm: we show that megaconstellations, deployed to offer innovative services to Earth's users, can provide excellent connectivity to LEO spacecraft as well. First, we characterise the communication link between space users and the actual OneWeb and Starlink constellations. A full set of results in terms of availability, access duration, Doppler, and path losses as a function of user orbital parameters, identifying optimal user orbits, is provided. The results achieved by a multi-system user able to communicate with both fleets are also presented. The potential improvements available if geostationary constellations are used to complement LEO megaconstellations in a multi-orbit system are discussed as well. Finally, we focus on two LEO use cases: the International Space Station and an Earth Observation Sun Synchronous satellite. All the results demonstrate the numerous advantages of the mega-constellation connectivity solution, which can transform LEO spacecraft into highly responsive nodes of a space-to-space network.</description>

      <title>ReGAIN: Retrieval-Grounded AI Framework for Network Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accurate network traffic analysis. ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments. ReGAIN also outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines while providing unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.</description>

      <title>SANet: A Semantic-aware Agentic AI Networking Framework for Cross-layer Optimization in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>OptiNIC: A Resilient and Tail-Optimal RDMA NIC for Distributed ML Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As distributed machine learning (ML) workloads scale to thousands of GPUs connected by high-speed interconnects, tail latency in collective communication has become a major bottleneck. Existing RDMA transports, such as RoCE, IRN, SRNIC, and Falcon, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While these approaches work well for general-purpose workloads, they introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly in ML, where even rare packet delays can stall entire model pipelines.
  We present OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for partial or missing data. OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA. Unlike traditional RDMA, which signals completion only after complete data delivery, OptiNIC introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress when data may be lost or delayed. OptiNIC retains standard congestion control mechanisms (e.g., DCQCN, EQDS, or Swift) while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline itself (e.g., via the Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding).
  Our evaluation shows that OptiNIC improves time-to-accuracy (TTA) by 2x and increases throughput by 1.6x for training and inference, respectively, across two public clouds (i.e., Hyperstack and CloudLab). OptiNIC also lowers 99th-percentile latency by 3.5x, cuts BRAM usage by 2.7x, and nearly doubles NIC resilience to faults-delivering a resilient, tail-optimized RDMA transport purpose-built for distributed ML workloads.</description>

      <title>Splitwise: Collaborative Edge-Cloud Inference for LLMs via Lyapunov-Assisted DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for detecting point and collective anomalies in operating system logs via collaborative transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.</description>

      <title>Local Rendezvous Hashing: Bounded Loads and Minimal Churn via Cache-Local Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697). A microbenchmark indicates multi-probe assignment is dominated by repeated ring searches and memory traffic rather than probe-generation arithmetic.</description>

      <title>A Privacy Protocol Using Ephemeral Intermediaries and a Rank-Deficient Matrix Power Function (RDMPF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a private transfer architecture for the Internet Computer (ICP) that decouples deposit and retrieval through two short-lived intermediaries, with sealed storage and attested teardown by an ephemeral witness. The protocol uses a non-interactive RDMPF-based encapsulation to derive per-transfer transport keys. A public notice hint is computed from the capsule to enable discovery without fingerprinting the recipient's key. Retrieval is authorized by a short proof of decapsulation that reveals no identities. All transaction intermediaries are ephemeral and issue certified destruction intents and proofs, allowing a noticeboard to publish auditable finalization records. The design provides sender identity privacy with respect to the recipient, content confidentiality against intermediaries, forward secrecy for transport keys after staged destruction, verifiable liveness and finality. We formalize the basic interfaces, provide the security arguments for encapsulation correctness, hint privacy, authorization soundness and timeout reclaim.
  In terms of implementation, it has been recently brought into production on the ICP under the name ICPP. It has been subject to exhaustive testing and incorporates a few enhancements, focusing on the operational possibilities offered by ICP's technology. This work hence serves as a broad reference for the protocol now publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Unlocking WebRTC for End User Driven Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a software architecture to enable end user driven innovation of web multimedia communication applications. RTC Helper is a simple and easy-to-use software that can intercept WebRTC (web real-time communication) and related APIs in the browser, and change the behavior of web apps in real-time. Such customization can even be driven by the end user on third-party web apps using our flexible and general purpose browser extension. It also facilitates rapid prototyping of ideas by web developers in their existing web apps without having to rebuild or redeploy after every change. It has more than ten customization categories, and over a hundred built-in examples covering a wide range of novel use cases in web-based audio/video communication.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO Under Mobility: A Fairness-Differentiated Handover Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) offers high network-wide throughput in static networks, especially for the worst-served users, its performance in mobile networks is not yet fully addressed. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a mobile CF-mMIMO network under a comprehensive throughput model and show that it suffers from large performance degradation due to the combined effect of channel aging and handover delay. To restore the performance of CF-mMIMO under mobility, we formulate a novel optimization problem to maximize the nett throughput given by our comprehensive throughput model. We propose a near-optimal handover scheme, nearOpt, by directly solving the relaxed optimization problem with Newton's method. We then design a heuristic scheme, FairDiff, to prioritize handovers for the poorly-served users using a policy threshold based on Jain's fairness index, which achieves equivalently good performance as nearOpt but with an order of magnitude lower complexity. We present an extensive evaluation of the mobile throughput performance of our handover schemes under realistic urban network distributions and UE mobility patterns. Our results show that, unlike the existing literature benchmarks that either obtain very low throughput for the worst-performing users or high throughput at the cost of very high computational complexity, our FairDiff scheme consistently achieves the highest network-wide throughput with the lowest computational complexity among all considered schemes. We thus for the first time propose a handover scheme that delivers the promise of uniformly good throughput for mobile CF-mMIMO, making it a feasible architecture for practical mobile networks.</description>

      <title>Towards a Robust Transport Network With Self-adaptive Network Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of the Network digital twin (NDT) to remain aware of changes in its physical counterpart, known as the physical twin (PTwin), is a fundamental condition to enable timely synchronization, also referred to as twinning. In this way, considering a transport network, a key requirement is to handle unexpected traffic variability and dynamically adapt to maintain optimal performance in the associated virtual model, known as the virtual twin (VTwin). In this context, we propose a self-adaptive implementation of a novel NDT architecture designed to provide accurate delay predictions, even under fluctuating traffic conditions. This architecture addresses an essential challenge, underexplored in the literature: improving the resilience of data-driven NDT platforms against traffic variability and improving synchronization between the VTwin and its physical counterpart. Therefore, the contributions of this article rely on NDT lifecycle by focusing on the operational phase, where telemetry modules are used to monitor incoming traffic, and concept drift detection techniques guide retraining decisions aimed at updating and redeploying the VTwin when necessary. We validate our architecture with a network management use case, across various emulated network topologies, and diverse traffic patterns to demonstrate its effectiveness in preserving acceptable performance and predicting quality of service (QoS) metrics under unexpected traffic variation, such as delay and jitter. The results in all tested topologies, using the normalized mean square error as the evaluation metric, demonstrate that our proposed architecture, after a traffic concept drift, achieves a performance improvement in per-flow delay and jitter prediction of at least 64% and 21%, respectively, compared to a configuration without NDT synchronization.</description>
