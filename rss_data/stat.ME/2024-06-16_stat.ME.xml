      <title>Ridge Regression for Paired Comparisons: A Tractable New Approach, with Application to Premier League Football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paired comparison models, such as Bradley-Terry and Thurstone-Mosteller, are commonly used to estimate relative strengths of pairwise compared items in tournament-style datasets. With predictive performance as primary criterion, we discuss estimation of paired comparison models with a ridge penalty. A new approach is derived which combines empirical Bayes and composite likelihoods without any need to re-fit the model, as a convenient alternative to cross-validation of the ridge tuning parameter. Simulation studies, together with application to 28 seasons of English Premier League football, demonstrate much better predictive accuracy of the new approach relative to ordinary maximum likelihood. While the application of a standard bias-reducing penalty was found to improve appreciably the performance of maximum likelihood, the ridge penalty with tuning as developed here yields greater accuracy still.</description>

      <title>Time Series Forecasting with Many Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for time series forecasting with many predictors, referred to as the GO-sdPCA, in this paper. The approach employs a variable selection method known as the group orthogonal greedy algorithm and the high-dimensional Akaike information criterion to mitigate the impact of irrelevant predictors. Moreover, a novel technique, called peeling, is used to boost the variable selection procedure so that many factor-relevant predictors can be included in prediction. Finally, the supervised dynamic principal component analysis (sdPCA) method is adopted to account for the dynamic information in factor recovery. In simulation studies, we found that the proposed method adapts well to unknown degrees of sparsity and factor strength, which results in good performance even when the number of relevant predictors is large compared to the sample size. Applying to economic and environmental studies, the proposed method consistently performs well compared to some commonly used benchmarks in one-step-ahead out-sample forecasts.</description>

Abstract: We review approaches to statistical inference based on randomization. Permutation tests are treated as an important special case. Under a certain group invariance property, referred to as the ``randomization hypothesis,'' randomization tests achieve exact control of the Type I error rate in finite samples. Although this unequivocal precision is very appealing, the range of problems that satisfy the randomization hypothesis is somewhat limited. We show that randomization tests are often asymptotically, or approximately, valid and efficient in settings that deviate from the conditions required for finite-sample error control. When randomization tests fail to offer even asymptotic Type 1 error control, their asymptotic validity may be restored by constructing an asymptotically pivotal test statistic. Randomization tests can then provide exact error control for tests of highly structured hypotheses with good performance in a wider class of problems. We give a detailed overview of several prominent applications of randomization tests, including two-sample permutation tests, regression, and conformal inference.</description>

      <title>Large language model validity via enhanced conformal prediction methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop new conformal inference methods for obtaining validity guarantees on the output of large language models (LLMs). Prior work in conformal language modeling identifies a subset of the text that satisfies a high-probability guarantee of correctness. These methods work by filtering claims from the LLM's original response if a scoring function evaluated on the claim fails to exceed a threshold calibrated via split conformal prediction. Existing methods in this area suffer from two deficiencies. First, the guarantee stated is not conditionally valid. The trustworthiness of the filtering step may vary based on the topic of the response. Second, because the scoring function is imperfect, the filtering step can remove many valuable and accurate claims. We address both of these challenges via two new conformal methods. First, we generalize the conditional conformal procedure of Gibbs et al. (2023) in order to adaptively issue weaker guarantees when they are required to preserve the utility of the output. Second, we show how to systematically improve the quality of the scoring function via a novel algorithm for differentiating through the conditional conformal procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Discovering influential text using convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental methods for estimating the impacts of text on human evaluation have been widely used in the social sciences. However, researchers in experimental settings are usually limited to testing a small number of pre-specified text treatments. While efforts to mine unstructured texts for features that causally affect outcomes have been ongoing in recent years, these models have primarily focused on the topics or specific words of text, which may not always be the mechanism of the effect. We connect these efforts with NLP interpretability techniques and present a method for flexibly discovering clusters of similar text phrases that are predictive of human reactions to texts using convolutional neural networks. When used in an experimental setting, this method can identify text treatments and their effects under certain assumptions. We apply the method to two datasets. The first enables direct validation of the model's ability to detect phrases known to cause the outcome. The second demonstrates its ability to flexibly discover text treatments with varying textual structures. In both cases, the model learns a greater variety of text treatments compared to benchmark methods, and these text features quantitatively meet or exceed the ability of benchmark methods to predict the outcome.</description>

      <title>Sparse Recovery With Multiple Data Streams: A Sequential Adaptive Testing Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.07215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multistage design has been used in a wide range of scientific fields. By allocating sensing resources adaptively, one can effectively eliminate null locations and localize signals with a smaller study budget. We formulate a decision-theoretic framework for simultaneous multi-stage adaptive testing and study how to minimize the total number of measurements while meeting pre-specified constraints on both the false positive rate (FPR) and missed discovery rate (MDR). The new procedure, which effectively pools information across individual tests using a simultaneous multistage adaptive ranking and thresholding (SMART) approach, controls the error rates and leads to great savings in total study costs. Numerical studies confirm the effectiveness of SMART. The SMART procedure is illustrated through the analysis of large-scale A/B tests, high-throughput screening and image analysis.</description>

      <title>Another look at forecast trimming for combinations: robustness, accuracy and diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecast combination is widely recognized as a preferred strategy over forecast selection due to its ability to mitigate the uncertainty associated with identifying a single "best" forecast. Nonetheless, sophisticated combinations are often empirically dominated by simple averaging, which is commonly attributed to the weight estimation error. The issue becomes more problematic when dealing with a forecast pool containing a large number of individual forecasts. In this paper, we propose a new forecast trimming algorithm to identify an optimal subset from the original forecast pool for forecast combination tasks. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed algorithm simultaneously takes into account the robustness, accuracy and diversity issues of the forecast pool, rather than isolating each one of these issues. We also develop five forecast trimming algorithms as benchmarks, including one trimming-free algorithm and several trimming algorithms that isolate each one of the three key issues. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves superior forecasting performance in general in terms of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. Nevertheless, we argue that diversity does not always have to be addressed in forecast trimming. Based on the results, we offer some practical guidelines on the selection of forecast trimming algorithms for a target series.</description>

      <title>A robust statistical framework for cyber-vulnerability prioritisation under partial information in threat intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proactive cyber-risk assessment is gaining momentum due to the wide range of sectors that can benefit from the prevention of cyber-incidents by preserving integrity, confidentiality, and the availability of data. The rising attention to cybersecurity also results from the increasing connectivity of cyber-physical systems, which generates multiple sources of uncertainty about emerging cyber-vulnerabilities. This work introduces a robust statistical framework for quantitative and qualitative reasoning under uncertainty about cyber-vulnerabilities and their prioritisation. Specifically, we take advantage of mid-quantile regression to deal with ordinal risk assessments, and we compare it to current alternatives for cyber-risk ranking and graded responses. For this purpose, we identify a novel accuracy measure suited for rank invariance under partial knowledge of the whole set of existing vulnerabilities. The model is tested on both simulated and real data from selected databases that support the evaluation, exploitation, or response to cyber-vulnerabilities in realistic contexts. Such datasets allow us to compare multiple models and accuracy measures, discussing the implications of partial knowledge about cyber-vulnerabilities on threat intelligence and decision-making in operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>What To Do (and Not to Do) with Causal Panel Analysis under Parallel Trends: Lessons from A Large Reanalysis Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are ubiquitous in causal panel analysis in political science. However, recent methodological discussions challenge their validity in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends assumption (PTA). This burgeoning literature has introduced multiple estimators and diagnostics, leading to confusion among empirical researchers on two fronts: the reliability of existing results based on TWFE models and the current best practices. To address these concerns, we examined, replicated, and reanalyzed 37 articles from three leading political science journals that employed observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six newly introduced HTE-robust estimators, along with diagnostics tests and uncertainty measures that are robust to PTA violations, we find that only a small minority of studies are highly robust. Although HTE-robust estimates tend to be broadly consistent with TWFE estimates, discrepancies in point estimates, increased measures of uncertainty, and potential PTA violations call into question many results that were already on the margins of statistical significance. We offer recommendations for improving practice in empirical research based on these findings.</description>

      <title>Neural Bayes Estimators for Irregular Spatial Data using Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Bayes estimators are neural networks that approximate Bayes estimators in a fast and likelihood-free manner. Although they are appealing to use with spatial models, where estimation is often a computational bottleneck, neural Bayes estimators in spatial applications have, to date, been restricted to data collected over a regular grid. These estimators are also currently dependent on a prescribed set of spatial locations, which means that the neural network needs to be re-trained for new data sets; this renders them impractical in many applications and impedes their widespread adoption. In this work, we employ graph neural networks to tackle the important problem of parameter point estimation from data collected over arbitrary spatial locations. In addition to extending neural Bayes estimation to irregular spatial data, our architecture leads to substantial computational benefits, since the estimator can be used with any configuration or number of locations and independent replicates, thus amortising the cost of training for a given spatial model. We also facilitate fast uncertainty quantification by training an accompanying neural Bayes estimator that approximates a set of marginal posterior quantiles. We illustrate our methodology on Gaussian and max-stable processes. Finally, we showcase our methodology on a data set of global sea-surface temperature, where we estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process model in 2161 spatial regions, each containing thousands of irregularly-spaced data points, in just a few minutes with a single graphics processing unit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To capture the extremal behaviour of complex environmental phenomena in practice, flexi\-ble techniques for modelling tail behaviour are required. In this paper, we introduce a variety of such methods, which were used by the Lancopula Utopiversity team to tackle the EVA (2023) Conference Data Challenge. This data challenge was split into four challenges, labelled C1-C4. Challenges C1 and C2 comprise univariate problems, where the goal is to estimate extreme quantiles for a non-stationary time series exhibiting several complex features. For these, we propose a flexible modelling technique, based on generalised additive models, with diagnostics indicating generally good performance for the observed data. Challenges C3 and C4 concern multivariate problems where the focus is on estimating joint extremal probabilities. For challenge C3, we propose an extension of available models in the multivariate literature and use this framework to estimate extreme probabilities in the presence of non-stationary dependence. Finally, for challenge C4, which concerns a 50 dimensional random vector, we employ a clustering technique to achieve dimension reduction and use a conditional modelling approach to estimate extremal probabilities across independent groups of variables.</description>

      <title>Improved multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators based on normalizing flows and dimensionality reduction techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of multifidelity uncertainty propagation for computationally expensive models. In particular, we consider the general setting where the high-fidelity and low-fidelity models have a dissimilar parameterization both in terms of number of random inputs and their probability distributions, which can be either known in closed form or provided through samples. We derive novel multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators which rely on a shared subspace between the high-fidelity and low-fidelity models where the parameters follow the same probability distribution, i.e., a standard Gaussian. We build the shared space employing normalizing flows to map different probability distributions into a common one, together with linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, active subspaces and autoencoders, respectively, which capture the subspaces where the models vary the most. We then compose the existing low-fidelity model with these transformations and construct modified models with an increased correlation with the high-fidelity model, which therefore yield multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators with reduced variance. A series of numerical experiments illustrate the properties and advantages of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Estimating the linear relation between variables that are never jointly observed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is motivated by in vivo experiments in which measurement are destructive so that the variables of interest can never be observed simultaneously when the aim is to estimate the regression coefficients of a linear regression. Assuming that the global experiment can be decomposed into sub experiments (corresponding for example to different doses) with distinct first moments, we propose different estimators of the linear regression which take account of that additional information. We consider estimators based on moments as well as estimators based optimal transport theory. These estimators are proved to be consistent as well as asymptotically Gaussian under weak hypotheses. The asymptotic variance has no explicit expression, except in some particular cases, and specific bootstrap approaches are developed to build confidence intervals for the estimated parameter. A Monte Carlo study is conducted to assess and compare the finite sample performances of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantifying patient and neighborhood risks for stillbirth and preterm birth in Philadelphia with a Bayesian spatial model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.04981v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stillbirth and preterm birth are major public health challenges. Using a Bayesian spatial model, we quantified patient-specific and neighborhood risks of stillbirth and preterm birth in the city of Philadelphia. We linked birth data from electronic health records at Penn Medicine hospitals from 2010 to 2017 with census-tract-level data from the United States Census Bureau. We found that both patient-level characteristics (e.g. self-identified race/ethnicity) and neighborhood-level characteristics (e.g. violent crime) were significantly associated with patients' risk of stillbirth or preterm birth. Our neighborhood analysis found that higher-risk census tracts had 2.68 times the average risk of stillbirth and 2.01 times the average risk of preterm birth compared to lower-risk census tracts. Higher neighborhood rates of women in poverty or on public assistance were significantly associated with greater neighborhood risk for these outcomes, whereas higher neighborhood rates of college-educated women or women in the labor force were significantly associated with lower risk. Several of these neighborhood associations were missed by the patient-level analysis. These results suggest that neighborhood-level analyses of adverse pregnancy outcomes can reveal nuanced relationships and, thus, should be considered by epidemiologists. Our findings can potentially guide place-based public health interventions to reduce stillbirth and preterm birth rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines finely stratified designs for the efficient estimation of treatment effect parameters in randomized experiments. In such designs, units are divided into groups of fixed size, with a proportion within each group randomly assigned to a binary treatment. We focus on parameters defined using moment conditions constructed from known functions of the observed data. We establish that the naive method of moments estimator under a finely stratified design achieves the same asymptotic variance as that obtained using ex post covariate adjustment in i.i.d. designs, and further that this variance achieves the efficiency bound in a large class of designs.</description>
