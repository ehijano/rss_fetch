      <title>Synchronization in random networks of identical phase oscillators: A graphon approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators have been used to model circadian rhythms, flashing fireflies, Josephson junction arrays, high-voltage electric grids, and many other kinds of self-organizing systems. Recently, several authors have sought to understand how coupled oscillators behave when they interact according to a random graph. Here we consider interaction networks generated by a graphon model known as a $W$-random network, and examine the dynamics of an infinite number of identical phase oscillators, following an approach pioneered by Medvedev. We show that with sufficient regularity on $W$, the solution to the dynamical system over a $W$-random network of size $n$ converges in the $L^{\infty}$ norm to the solution of the continuous graphon system, with high probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$. This result suggests a framework for studying synchronization properties in large but finite random networks. In this paper, we leverage our convergence result in the $L^{\infty}$ norm to prove synchronization results for two classes of identical phase oscillators on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. First, we show that the Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G(n, \alpha_n)$ achieves phase synchronization with high probability as $n$ goes to infinity, if the edge probability $\alpha_n$ exceeds $(\log n)/n$, the connectivity threshold of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Then we show that the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G(n, p)$ achieves frequency synchronization with high probability as $n$ goes to infinity, assuming a fixed edge probability $p\in(0,1]$ and a certain regime for the model's phase shift parameter. A notable feature of the latter result is that it holds for an oscillator model whose dynamics are not simply given by a gradient flow.</description>

      <title>The transcritical Bogdanov Takens bifurcation with boundary due to the risk perception on a recruitment epidemiological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an epidemiological model with treatment and recruitment considering the risk perception. In this model, we consider an exponential function as a recruitment rate. We have found that this model undergoes the transcritical Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation with boundary, where the system experiences the transcritical bifurcation between the disease-free equilibrium point and the endemic equilibrium point. The Hopf bifurcation also arises at the endemic equilibrium point, this is, the appearance or disappearance of a limit cycle, and finally, the Homoclinic bifurcation which transforms the limit cycle into a homoclinic cycle, starting and ending at the disease-free equilibrium point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subthreshold oscillations in neurons are those oscillations which do not attain the critical value of the membrane's voltage needed for triggering an action potential (a spike). Their contribution to the forming of action potentials in neurons is a current field of research in biology. The present work approaches this subject using tools from mathematical modeling, more exactly, a neuronal non-smooth map-based model is proposed and studied. The behavior of the model in a noisy medium is also studied.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the parameters for $(\alpha,\beta)$-transformations with the specification property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the specification property for $(\alpha,\beta)$-shifts. When $\alpha=0$, Schmeling shows that the set of $\beta&gt;1$ for which the $\beta$-shift has the specification property has the Lebesgue measure zero but has the full Hausdorff dimension\cite{Schmeling}. So it is natural to ask what happens when $\alpha&gt;0$. Buzzi shows that for fixed $\alpha$ the set of $\beta &gt;1$ for which the $(\alpha,\beta)$-shift has the specification property has Lebesgue measure zero. Hence we consider the Hausdorff dimension of the parameter space of $(\alpha,\beta)$-shifts.</description>

      <title>Resonances in nonlinear systems with a decaying chirped-frequency excitation and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of multiplicative white noise on the resonance capture of strongly nonlinear oscillatory systems under chirped-frequency excitations is investigated. It is assumed that the intensity of the perturbation decays polynomially with time, and its frequency grows according to a power low. Resonant solutions with a growing amplitude and phase, synchronized with the excitation, are considered. The persistence of such a regime in the presence of stochastic perturbations is discussed. In particular, conditions are described that guarantee the stochastic stability of the resonant modes on infinite or asymptotically large time intervals. The technique used is based on a combination of the averaging method, stability analysis and construction of stochastic Lyapunov functions. The proposed theory is applied to the Duffing oscillator with a chirped-frequency excitation and noise.</description>

      <title>Billiard tables with analytic Birkhoff normal form are generically Gevrey divergent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of the existence of an analytic normal form near an equilibrium point of an area-preserving map and analyticity of the associated coordinate change is a classical problem in dynamical systems going back to Poincar\'e and Siegel. One important class of examples of area-preserving maps consists of the collision maps for planar billiards. Recently, Treschev discovered a formal $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric billiard with locally linearizable dynamics and conjectured its convergence. Since then, a Gevrey regularity for such a billiard was proven by Wang and Zhang, but the original problem about analyticity still remains open.
  We extend the class of billiards by relaxing the symmetry condition and allowing conjugacies to non-linear analytic integrable normal forms. To keep the formal solution unique, odd table derivatives and the normal form are treated as parameters of the problem. We show that for the new problem, the series of the billiard table diverge for general parameters by proving the optimality of Gevrey bounds. The general parameter set is prevalent (in a certain sense has full measure) and it contains an open set.
  Instead of considering the problem in a functional sense and iterating approximation procedures, we employ formal power series methods and one-by-one directly reconstruct all the Taylor coefficients of the table. In order to prove that on an open set Taylor series diverges we define a Taylor recurrence operator and prove that it has a cone property. All solutions in that cone are only Gevrey regular and not analytic.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning invariant foliations in forced systems for reduced order modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify reduced order models (ROM) of forced systems from data using invariant foliations. The forcing can be external, parametric, periodic or quasi-periodic. The process has four steps: 1. identify an approximate invariant torus and the linear dynamics about the torus; 2. identify a globally defined invariant foliation about the torus; 3. identify a local foliation about an invariant manifold that complements the global foliation 4. extract the invariant manifold as the leaf going through the torus and interpret the result. We combine steps 2 and 3, so that we can track the location of the invariant torus and scale the invariance equations appropriately. We highlight some fundamental limitations of invariant manifolds and foliations when fitting them to data, that require further mathematics to resolve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-free forecasting of the temporal evolution of chaotic systems is crucial but challenging. Existing solutions require hyperparameter tuning, significantly hindering their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce a tree-based approach not requiring hyperparameter tuning: TreeDOX. It uses time delay overembedding as explicit short-term memory and Extra-Trees Regressors to perform feature reduction and forecasting. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TreeDOX using the Henon map, Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems, and the real-world Southern Oscillation Index.</description>

      <title>Control of Medical Digital Twins with Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of personalized medicine is to tailor interventions to an individual patient's unique characteristics. A key technology for this purpose involves medical digital twins, computational models of human biology that can be personalized and dynamically updated to incorporate patient-specific data collected over time. Certain aspects of human biology, such as the immune system, are not easily captured with physics-based models, such as differential equations. Instead, they are often multi-scale, stochastic, and hybrid. This poses a challenge to existing model-based control and optimization approaches that cannot be readily applied to such models. Recent advances in automatic differentiation and neural-network control methods hold promise in addressing complex control problems. However, the application of these approaches to biomedical systems is still in its early stages. This work introduces dynamics-informed neural-network controllers as an alternative approach to control of medical digital twins. As a first use case for this method, the focus is on agent-based models, a versatile and increasingly common modeling platform in biomedicine. The effectiveness of the proposed neural-network control method is illustrated and benchmarked against other methods with two widely-used agent-based model types. The relevance of the method introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows I: projective Anosov subgroups and exponential mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By constructing a non-empty domain of discontinuity in a suitable homogeneous space, we prove that every torsion-free projective Anosov subgroup is the monodromy group of a locally homogeneous contact Axiom A dynamical system with a unique basic hyperbolic set on which the flow is conjugate to the refraction flow of Sambarino. Under the assumption of irreducibility, we utilize the work of Stoyanov to establish spectral estimates for the associated complex Ruelle transfer operators, and by way of corollary: exponential mixing, exponentially decaying error term in the prime orbit theorem, and a spectral gap for the Ruelle zeta function. With no irreducibility assumption, results of Dyatlov-Guillarmou imply the global meromorphic continuation of zeta functions with smooth weights, as well as the existence of a discrete spectrum of Ruelle-Pollicott resonances and (co)-resonant states. We apply our results to space-like geodesic flows for the convex cocompact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of Danciger-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel, and the Benoist-Hilbert geodesic flow for strictly convex real projective manifolds.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is the most relevant characteristic of systems of interest in nature and technology; ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle numbers through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we discuss complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying numbers of particles inspired by different specific numerical goals and provide a generalized equation that embeds all of them.</description>

Abstract: The Sinai billiard flow on the two-torus, i.e., the periodic Lorentz gas, is a continuous flow, but it is not everywhere differentiable. Assuming finite horizon, we relate the equilibrium states of the flow with those of the Sinai billiard map $T$ -- which is a discontinuous map. We propose a definition for the topological pressure $P_*(T,g)$ associated to a potential $g$. We prove that for any piecewise H\"older potential $g$ satisfying a mild assumption, $P_*(T,g)$ is equal to the definitions of Bowen using spanning or separating sets. We give sufficient conditions under which a potential gives rise to equilibrium states for the Sinai billiard map. We prove that in this case the equilibrium state $\mu_g$ is unique, Bernoulli, adapted and gives positive measure to all nonempty open sets. For this, we make use of a well chosen transfer operator acting on anisotropic Banach spaces, and construct the measure by pairing its maximal eigenvectors. Last, we prove that the flow invariant probability measure $\bar \mu_g$, obtained by taking the product of $\mu_g$ with the Lebesgue measure along orbits, is Bernoulli and flow adapted. We give examples of billiard tables for which there exists an open set of potentials satisfying those sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems on Compact Metrizable Groups</title>

Abstract: This paper is aim to extend Kenneth R. Berg's findings on the maximal entropy theorem and the ergodicity of measure convolution to the case of surjective homomorphisms.
  We further explores dynamical systems under surjective homomorphism in detail, especially the variation of entropy. Let $G_{1} $ and $G_{2} $ be compact metrizable groups, and suppose that $G_{2} $ acts freely on $G_{1} $, the continuous mapping $T_{1} $ and homomorphism $T_{2} :G_{2} \to G_{2} $ satisfy $T_{1} (yx)=T_{2} (y)T_{1} (x)$, where $y\in G_{2} ,{\rm \; }x\in G_{1} $. If $\mu _{0} \in M(T_{0} )$, $\mu _{0} '$ is the Haar extention of $\mu _{0} $, we proved that when $\mu \in $$M(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} )$, the entropy $h(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} '){\rm \; }$is always greater than or equal to $h(T_{1} ,\mu )$; if $\mu _{0} '$ is ergodic with respect to $T_{1} $, and the Haar measure $m$ on $G_{2} $ is ergodic with respect to $T_{2} $, and if $h(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} ')&lt;\infty $, then the entropy $h(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} '){\rm \; }$is greater than $h(T_{1} ,\mu ).$
  Finally, this paper also specifically discusses the ergodicity of the convolution of invariant measures. Let $T$ be a surjective homomorphism on $G$, if $(G,T,{\rm {\mathcal F}},\mu )$ and$(G,T,{\rm {\mathcal F}},\nu )$ are disjoint ergodic dynamical systems, then $\mu *\nu $ is ergodic. Via a proof by contradiction, the study demonstrates that the measure convolution of two disjoint ergodic dynamical systems can maintain ergodicity under the condition that $T$is a surjective homomorphism on $G$.</description>

      <title>Generic regularity of Level Set Flows with spherical singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sphere is well-known as the only generic compact shrinker for mean curvature flow (MCF). In this paper, we characterize the generic dynamics of MCFs with a spherical singularity. In terms of the level set flow formulation of MCF, we establish that generically the arrival time function of level set flow with spherical singularity has at most $C^2$ regularity.</description>

      <title>On continuation and convex Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05932v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that the origin is globally asymptotically stable under a set of continuous vector fields on Euclidean space and suppose that all those vector fields come equipped with -- possibly different -- convex Lyapunov functions. We show that this implies there is a homotopy between any two of those vector fields such that the origin remains globally asymptotically stable along the homotopy. Relaxing the assumption on the origin to any compact convex set or relaxing convexity to geodesic convexity does not alter the conclusion. Imposing the same convexity assumptions on control Lyapunov functions leads to a Hautus-like stabilizability test. These results ought to be of interest in the context of learning stability certificates, policy gradient methods and switched systems.</description>

      <title>Replica-mean-field limit of continuous-time fragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many phenomena can be modeled as network dynamics with punctuate interactions. However, most relevant dynamics do not allow for computational tractability. To circumvent this difficulty, the Poisson Hypothesis regime replaces interaction times between nodes by independent Poisson processes, allowing for tractability in several cases, such as intensity-based models from computational neuroscience. This hypothesis is usually only conjectured, or numerically validated. In this work, we introduce a class of processes in continuous time called continuous fragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes, by analogy with previously introduced processes in discrete time. The state of each node, described by the stochastic intensity of an associated point process, aggregates arrivals from its neighbors and is fragmented upon departure. We consider the replica-mean-field version of such a process, which is a physical system consisting of randomly interacting copies of the network of interest. Generalizing results proved in discrete time and in the particular case of excitatory intensity-based neural dynamics, we prove that the Poisson Hypothesis holds at the limit of an infinite number of replicas.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Reeb orbit on some real projective three-spaces via ECH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of an elliptic Reeb orbit for some contact forms on the real projective three space $\mathbb{R} P^3$. The main ingredient of the proof is the existence of a distinguished pseudoholomorphic curve in the symplectization given by the $U$ map on ECH. Also, we check that the first value on the ECH spectrum coincides with the smallest action of null-homologous orbit sets for $1/4$-pinched Riemannian metrics and compute the ECH spectrum for the irrational Katok metric example.</description>

      <title>Proof of Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder's two or infinity conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every Reeb flow on a closed connected three-manifold has either two or infinitely many simple periodic orbits, assuming that the associated contact structure has torsion first Chern class. As a special case, we prove a conjecture of Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder published in 2003 asserting that a smooth and autonomous Hamiltonian flow on $\mathbb{R}^4$ has either two or infinitely many simple periodic orbits on any regular compact connected energy level that is transverse to the radial vector field. Other corollaries settle some old problems about Finsler metrics: we show that every Finsler metric on $S^2$ has either two or infinitely many prime closed geodesics; and we show that a Finsler metric on $S^2$ with at least one closed geodesic that is not irrationally elliptic must have infinitely many prime closed geodesics. The novelty of our work is that we do not make any nondegeneracy hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Let's do the time-warp-attend: Learning topological invariants of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems across the sciences, from electrical circuits to ecological networks, undergo qualitative and often catastrophic changes in behavior, called bifurcations, when their underlying parameters cross a threshold. Existing methods predict oncoming catastrophes in individual systems but are primarily time-series-based and struggle both to categorize qualitative dynamical regimes across diverse systems and to generalize to real data. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven, physically-informed deep-learning framework for classifying dynamical regimes and characterizing bifurcation boundaries based on the extraction of topologically invariant features. We focus on the paradigmatic case of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is used to model periodic dynamics across a wide range of applications. Our convolutional attention method is trained with data augmentations that encourage the learning of topological invariants which can be used to detect bifurcation boundaries in unseen systems and to design models of biological systems like oscillatory gene regulatory networks. We further demonstrate our method's use in analyzing real data by recovering distinct proliferation and differentiation dynamics along pancreatic endocrinogenesis trajectory in gene expression space based on single-cell data. Our method provides valuable insights into the qualitative, long-term behavior of a wide range of dynamical systems, and can detect bifurcations or catastrophic transitions in large-scale physical and biological systems.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. For all but finitely many $m\in \mathbb{N}$, we exhibit the first examples of non-locally rigid, Zariski dense, robust quasi-isometric embeddings of hyperbolic groups in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{K})$ which are not limits of Anosov representations. As a consequence, we show that an analogue of Sullivan's structural stabilty theorem for Kleinian groups fails for Anosov representations in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{C}), m\geq 30$.</description>

      <title>The frequency problem of the three gap theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three gap theorem was originally a conjecture by Steinhaus, who asserted that there are at most three distinct gap lengths in the fractional parts of the sequence {\alpha},{2}{\alpha},{\cdots},{N}{\alpha} for any integer {N} and real number {\alpha}. This conjecture has been proved by many different methods, and extended to higher dimensional cases. For the three gap theorem, what is the frequence of two gaps or three gaps? On the basis of Ravenstein's work, this paper studies the frequency of the three gap theorem through cake model. We show that for almost all {\alpha\in (0,1)\backslash \mathbb {Q}} in the sence of the Lebesgue measure, the frequency of the two gaps is {0}, in other words, the frequency of the three gaps is {1}. The proof makes full use of the continued fraction expansion of {\alpha}, as well as partial results in the Diophantine approximation. Finally, we illustrate that two gaps occur with a frequency of {0}.</description>
