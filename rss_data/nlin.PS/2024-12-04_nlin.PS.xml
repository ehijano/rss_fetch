      <title>Thermo-optical spiking and mixed-mode oscillations in injected Kerr microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of vertically emitting Kerr microcavities under detuned optical injection, considering the impact of slow thermal effects. Our model integrates thermal detuning caused by refractive index shifts due to heating. Through numerical and analytical approaches, we uncover a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors, including excitable thermo-optical pulses, mixed-mode oscillations, and chaotic spiking, governed by a higher-dimensional canard scenario. Introducing a long external feedback loop with time delays comparable to the microcavity photon lifetime but shorter than thermal relaxation timescales, reveals how delay affects excitability and stabilizes temporal localized states. Our findings extend the understanding of excitable systems, demonstrating how thermal and feedback mechanisms interplay to shape nonlinear optical dynamics. Further, our approach paves the way for the study of cavity stabilization and cavity cooling using an additional control beam.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Synchronization of Active Quantum Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active agents are capable of exerting nonreciprocal forces upon one another. For instance, one agent, say $A$, may attract another agent $B$ while $B$ repels $A$. These antagonistic nonreciprocal interactions have been extensively studied in classical systems, revealing a wealth of exciting phenomena such as novel phase transitions and traveling-wave states. Whether these phenomena can originate in quantum many-body systems is an open issue, and proposals for their realization are lacking. In this work, we present a model of two species of quantum spins that interact in an antagonistic nonreciprocal way of the attraction-repulsion type. We propose an implementation based on two atomic ensembles coupled via chiral waveguides featuring both braided and non-braided geometries. The spins are active due to the presence of local gain, which allows them to synchronize. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that nonreciprocal interactions result in a nonreciprocal phase transition to time-crystalline traveling-wave states, associated with spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. We establish how this symmetry emerges from the microscopic quantum model. For a finite number of spins, signatures of the time-crystal phase can still be identified by inspecting equal-time or two-time correlation functions. Remarkably, continuous monitoring of the output field of the waveguides induces a quantum traveling-wave state: a time-crystalline state of a finite-size quantum system, in which parity-time symmetry is spontaneously broken. Our work lays the foundation to explore nonreciprocal interactions in active quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Extending the FDTD GVADE method nonlinear polarization vector to include anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector, the nonlinear electric dipole moment per unit volume, is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the numerical method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then example simulation results are presented for two isotropic media. First, the simplified 2D transverse magnetic case is revisited for the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper, including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector in the simulation; the simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with the purely isotropic polarization vector simulation results. Second, a simplified 2D transverse magnetic example was simulated in carbon disulfide, with its strong molecular re-orientation induced polarization anisotropy.</description>
