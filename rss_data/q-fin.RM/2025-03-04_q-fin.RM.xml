      <title>Forecasting realized volatility in the stock market: a path-dependent perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatility forecasting in financial markets is a topic that has received more attention from scholars. In this paper, we propose a new volatility forecasting model that combines the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model with a family of path-dependent volatility models (HAR-PD). The model utilizes the long- and short-term memory properties of price data to capture volatility features and trend features. By integrating the features of path-dependent volatility into the HAR model family framework, we develop a new set of volatility forecasting models. And, we propose a HAR-REQ model based on the empirical quartile as a threshold, which exhibits stronger forecasting ability compared to the HAR-REX model. Subsequently, the predictive performance of the HAR-PD model family is evaluated by statistical tests using data from the Chinese stock market and compared with the basic HAR model family. The empirical results show that the HAR-PD model family has higher forecasting accuracy compared to the underlying HAR model family. In addition, robustness tests confirm the significant predictive power of the HAR-PD model family.</description>

      <title>Dynamic spillovers and investment strategies across artificial intelligence ETFs, artificial intelligence tokens, and green markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the risk spillovers among AI ETFs, AI tokens, and green markets using the R2 decomposition method. We reveal several key insights. First, the overall transmission connectedness index (TCI) closely aligns with the contemporaneous TCI, while the lagged TCI is significantly lower. Second, AI ETFs and clean energy act as risk transmitters, whereas AI tokens and green bond function as risk receivers. Third, AI tokens are difficult to hedge and provide limited hedging ability compared to AI ETFs and green assets. However, multivariate portfolios effectively reduce AI tokens investment risk. Among them, the minimum correlation portfolio outperforms the minimum variance and minimum connectedness portfolios.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Factor Correlation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new dynamic factor correlation model with a novel variation-free parametrization of factor loadings. The model is applicable to high dimensions and can accommodate time-varying correlations, heterogeneous heavy-tailed distributions, and dependent idiosyncratic shocks, such as those observed in returns on stocks in the same subindustry. We apply the model to a "small universe" with 12 asset returns and to a "large universe" with 323 asset returns. The former facilitates a comprehensive empirical analysis and comparisons and the latter demonstrates the flexibility and scalability of the model.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that a portion of short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from liquidity fluctuations induced by wash trading. We develop a model decomposing liquidity into two components: liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (probability of fluctuation). High values for both liquidity measures indicate wash trading, while high liquidity jump with low liquidity diffusion suggests legitimate high-demand trading. Together, these liquidity measures enable detection of wash trades and help market participants understand liquidity dynamics, and make informed decisions in crypto trading.</description>

      <title>On multivariate contribution measures of systemic risk with applications in cryptocurrency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional risk measures and their associated risk contribution measures are commonly employed in finance and actuarial science for evaluating systemic risk and quantifying the effects of risk interactions. This paper introduces various types of contribution ratio measures based on the MCoVaR, MCoES, and MMME studied in Ortega-Jim\'enez et al. (2021) and Das &amp; Fasen-Hartmann (2018) to assess the relative effects of a single risk when other risks in a group are in distress. The properties of these contribution risk measures are examined, and sufficient conditions for comparing these measures between two sets of random vectors are established using univariate and multivariate stochastic orders and statistically dependent notions. Numerical examples are presented to validate these conditions. Finally, a real dataset from the cryptocurrency market is used to analyze the spillover effects through our proposed contribution measures.</description>

      <title>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About XVA Model Risk but Were Afraid to Ask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valuation adjustments, collectively named XVA, play an important role in modern derivatives pricing to take into account additional price components such as counterparty and funding risk premia. They are an exotic price component carrying a significant model risk and computational effort even for vanilla trades. We adopt an industry-standard realistic and complete XVA modelling framework, typically used by XVA trading desks, based on multi-curve time-dependent volatility G2++ stochastic dynamics calibrated on real market data, and a multi-step Monte Carlo simulation including both variation and initial margins. We apply this framework to the most common linear and non-linear interest rates derivatives, also comparing the MC results with XVA analytical formulas. Within this framework, we identify the most relevant model risk sources affecting the precision of XVA figures and we measure the corresponding computational effort. In particular, we show how to build a parsimonious and efficient MC time simulation grid able to capture the spikes arising in collateralized exposure during the margin period of risk. As a consequence, we also show how to tune accuracy vs performance, leading to sufficiently robust XVA figures in a reasonable time, a very important feature for practical applications. Furthermore, we provide a quantification of the XVA model risk stemming from the existence of a range of different parameterizations according to the EU prudent valuation regulation. Finally, this work also serves as an handbook containing step-by-step instructions for the implementation of a complete, realistic and robust modelling framework of collateralized exposure and XVA.</description>

      <title>Risk-Adjusted Performance of Random Forest Models in High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of the theoretical challenges posed by the Efficient Market Hypothesis to technical analysis, the effectiveness of technical indicators in high-frequency trading remains inadequately explored, particularly at the minute-level frequency, where effects of the microstructure of the market dominate. This study evaluates the integration of traditional technical indicators with random forest regression models using minute-level SPY data, analyzing 13 distinct model configurations. Our empirical results reveal a stark contrast between in-sample and out-of-sample performance, with $R^2$ values deteriorating from 0.749--0.812 during training to negative values in testing. A feature importance analysis demonstrates that primary price-based features dominate the predictions made by the model, accounting for over 60% of the importance, while established technical indicators, such as RSI and Bollinger Bands, account for only 14%--15%. Although the indicator-enhanced models achieved superior risk-adjusted metrics, with Rachev ratios between 0.919 and 0.961, they consistently underperformed a simple buy-and-hold strategy, generating returns ranging from -2.4% to -3.9%. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about the usefulness of technical indicators in algorithmic trading, suggesting that in high-frequency contexts, they may be more relevant to risk management rather than to predicting returns. For practitioners and researchers, our findings indicate that successful high-frequency trading strategies should focus on adaptive feature selection and regime-specific modeling rather than relying on traditional technical indicators, as well as indicating the critical importance of robust out-of-sample testing in the development of a model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic reinsurance design with heterogeneous beliefs under the mean-variance framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic reinsurance design problem under the mean-variance criterion, incorporating heterogeneous beliefs between the insurer and the reinsurer, and introducing an incentive compatibility constraint to address moral hazard. The insurer's surplus process is modeled using the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg risk model, with the option to invest in a risk-free asset. To solve the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system, we apply the partitioned domain optimization technique, transforming the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one determined by several key parameters. The resulting optimal reinsurance contracts are more complex than the standard proportional and excess-of-loss contracts commonly studied in the mean-variance literature with homogeneous beliefs. By further assuming specific forms of belief heterogeneity, we derive the parametric solutions and obtain a clear optimal equilibrium solution. Finally, we compare our results with models where the insurer and reinsurer share identical beliefs or where the incentive compatibility constraint is relaxed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of belief heterogeneity on optimal reinsurance strategies.</description>
