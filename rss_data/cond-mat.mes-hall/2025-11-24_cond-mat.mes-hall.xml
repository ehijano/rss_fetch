      <title>Liouvillian topology and non-reciprocal dynamics in open Floquet chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can exhibit remarkable physical phenomena including topological properties without a direct equilibrium counterpart. Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of A Dual Gated Mirror Symmetric Twisted Trilayer Graphene Device to Study Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though research on graphene by itself has waned, the interest in moire materials, materials made with stacked layers of graphene with a rotational twist between the layers, has exploded in popularity. These layered devices show a key feature, flat bands. Flat bands localize electrons, which in turn leads to the expression of correlated states such as Mott insulators, superconductivity, and more. A key property of these devices is that their 2D nature allows us to tune them in situ, effectively allowing us to change the device's electronic properties. This powerful ability greatly reduces the time and money required to study superconductivity. The superconductivity in these systems seems to be similar to high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates, giving us a path towards studying high-temperature superconductivity. The fabrication of these devices is nontrivial, and thus we detail one general way to create these layered devices to give maximal tunability.</description>

      <title>Cusped Electrical Conductivity in Spin-1 Chiral Fermion Systems Arising from Multifold Band Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-dependent electrical conductivity in spin-1 chiral fermion systems with disorder is studied using the self-consistent Born approximation. A distinct cusp-like feature appears at an energy different from the band-crossing point, arising from the multifold band-crossing structure formed by the Dirac and trivial bands. The energy position of the cusp and the corresponding value of the electrical conductivity are found to depend sensitively on both the impurity scattering strength and the curvature of the trivial band. These findings demonstrate the critical role of multifold band crossings and disorder-induced broadening of energy levels in determining the transport properties, offering theoretical insight into the unconventional conductivity behavior observed in topological semimetals hosting spin-1 chiral fermions.</description>

      <title>Giant Nonlinear Photon-Drag Currents in Centrosymmetric Moir\'e Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified microscopic theory of nonlinear photon-drag currents, formulated within a geometric-loop framework that provides both transparent quantum-geometric interpretation and numerical tractability. In this picture, the photon-drag shift current corresponds to the dipole moment of the geometric loop, while the photon-drag injection current arises from the same loop weighted by a band velocity difference. We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy. Remarkably, an in-plane wavevector only a few times larger than that of free-space photons already produces sizable photon-drag currents in centrosymmetric TBG, comparable to photogalvanic responses in typical noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional materials. These currents are broadly tunable by twist angle, photon wavevector, and light polarization. Our results establish a quantum geometric framework for nonlinear photon-drag phenomena and highlight moir\'e bilayers as promising platforms for large, highly tunable optoelectronic responses.</description>

      <title>A topological field-effect memristor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann architecture requires new computational paradigms capable of solving complex problems efficiently. Quantum and neuromorphic computing rely on unconventional materials and device functionalities, yet achieving resilience to imperfections and reliable operation remains a major challenge. This has motivated growing interest in topological materials that provide robust and low-power operation while preserving coherence. However, integrating coherent topological transport with non-volatile memory functionality in a single reconfigurable device has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime. The intrinsic floating-gate behavior allows one to reconfigure the transistor functionality into memristive functionality with broad electric-field tunability. Unlike other memristor implementations, one resistance state is governed entirely by dissipationless, coherent transport through helical edge channels, while the other arises from incoherent bulk conduction. By combining electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, our device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element that integrates coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Single-Defect Spectroscopy via Random Telegraph Noise in Graphene-Contacted ReS$_2$-hBN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect spectroscopy in two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) requires device architectures that suppress contact and disorder artifacts while preserving intrinsic carrier dynamics. Here, we demonstrate ReS$_2$-hBN FETs with few-layer graphene (FLG) van der Waals contacts that form nearly barrier-free interfaces, enabling intrinsic transport in ReS$_2$, an anisotropic, low-symmetry TMDC rarely exhibiting disorder-free behavior. The clean ReS$_2$-FLG platform allows direct observation of random telegraph noise (RTN) even in micron-scale channels, manifested as discrete two-level current fluctuations between 90-150 K arising from stochastic trapping at localized hBN defect sites. With increasing temperature, the RTN evolves into a 1/f spectrum as multiple traps activate. Statistical analysis of RTN amplitudes and capture-emission kinetics identifies substitutional carbon-related centers in hBN as dominant defects. These findings establish a generalizable approach for probing dielectric-origin defect dynamics in intrinsically conducting, low-symmetry 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Efficiency of Intermediate-Band Semiconductor Solar Cells Embedded with Quantum Dot Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale approach for modeling an intermediate-band solar cell based on a GaAs-GaAlAs quantum dot superlattice of cubic symmetry. Our framework combines high-accuracy theoretical calculations of the superlattice band structure and miniband-related absorption coefficient with experimentally determined interband absorption data. The quantum-mechanically derived absorption spectrum is incorporated into a drift-diffusion transport model in COMSOL Multiphysics, where key processes, including thermal and radiative recombination, are taken into account. This integrated methodology enables realistic modeling of device performance. Our results identify an optimal superlattice constant of 14 nm, yielding a maximum solar cell efficiency of 13.3 percent. Further increase in the superlattice constant enhances the miniband-related absorption peak but reduces the generation rate in the n-type region, resulting in a net efficiency decrease. The proposed approach, integrating theoretical, experimental, and computational components, provides a reliable framework for assessing solar cells based on quantum dot superlattices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Kondo effect in a bilayer graphene quantum channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between itinerant electrons and localized spins is key to a wide range of electronic phenomena. Of particular interest is the regime where the interacting electrons exhibit both spin and valley degeneracy, resulting in SU(4) Kondo physics. However, this regime is challenging to realize in typical mesoscopic systems because it requires a strong interaction between electrons, resulting in a Kondo temperature ($T_\mathrm{K}$) significantly larger than the spin and valley splittings. Here, we present conductance measurements of a quantum point contact (QPC) in bilayer graphene (BLG). Beyond the expected quantized conductance plateaus, which reflect spin and valley degeneracy, we observe an additional subband, known as `0.7 anomaly' exhibiting signatures of Kondo physics and a $T_\mathrm{K}$ ranging from approximately 0.5 up to 2.4 K at zero magnetic field, corresponding to Kondo energies between 40 and 200 $\mu$eV. Given that the spin-orbit splitting in BLG is between 40 and 80 $\mu$eV, we argue that these results are consistent with a transition between four-fold degenerate SU(4) and two-fold degenerate spin-valley locked SU(2) Kondo effects. Furthermore, we break the valley degeneracy of the lowest subband by an out-of-plane magnetic field and show that Kondo signatures remain present, indicating a transition from SU(4) to a valley-polarized SU(2) Kondo effect, and showing the versatility of BLG QPCs for exploring many-body effects.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of unconventional spin-orbit torque and in-plane Hall effect in a single ferromagnetic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry of a material fundamentally governs its spin transport properties. While unconventional spin transport phenomena have been predominantly explored in low-symmetry systems (e.g., $C_{1v}$ symmetry), high-symmetry crystals--which constitute the majority of industry-compatible materials--are generally expected to exhibit only conventional spin-transport behavior. Here, we report the coexistence of two unconventional spin transport effects, the crystal spin-orbit torque (CSOT) and the crystal in-plane Hall effect (CIHE), in a CoPt single ferromagnetic layer with $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Leveraging the CSOT, we achieve nearly 100% field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in a 6 nm CoPt layer at room temperature. Simultaneously, the CIHE observed in this material exhibits nearly identical dependencies on both current angle and growth temperature as the CSOT. Symmetry analysis confirms that both effects share a common physical origin. Our work not only establishes CoPt as a high-performance spin-orbit material, but also demonstrates that unconventional spin transport can be realized in high-symmetry systems, thereby opening a broad pathway for their application in practical spintronics.</description>

      <title>Building 3D superconductor-based Josephson junctions using a via transfer approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of superconductivity to unconventional materials may lead to novel quantum states and potential applications. Controlling the quality of the superconductor-normal metal interface is of crucial importance to the understanding and engineering of the superconducting proximity effect. In many cases, conventional lithography-based deposition methods introduce undesirable effects. Using the concept of via contact and dry transfer, we have constructed smooth, van der Waals-like contact between 3D superconducting NbN/Pd and graphene with low contact resistance of approximately 130 $\Omega \cdot \mu m$. Gate-tunable supercurrent, Fraunhofer pattern, and Andreev reflections are observed, the properties of which can be understood using an induced superconducting gap $\Delta$' in this planar contact geometry. We discuss potential mechanisms impacting the magnitude of $\Delta$' and suggest ways of further increasing the proximity coupling. This gentle, lithography-free contacting method can be applied to air- and damage-sensitive surfaces to engineer novel superconducting heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An external orbital magnetic field applied perpendicular to the separation vector of a pair of Weyl points can couple them and induce a gap in the electronic spectrum. In this work, we investigate the gap-opening behavior in the presence of a lattice, revealing rich phenomenology absent in the continuum picture. Specifically, we address the emergence of layered Chern insulating states, examining how the anisotropy of the Weyl cone dispersion influences the sequence of phase transitions, and establishing connections to the continuum limit. We analyze the evolution of surface Fermi-arc states across these regimes, highlighting their distinct behaviors during the gap-opening transitions.</description>

      <title>Fast and Continuous Detection of Single Microwave Photons via Photo-assisted Quasiparticle Tunneling to a Superconducting Island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a single-photon detector operating in the microwave domain, based on photo-assisted quasiparticle tunneling events that poison a superconducting island. The detection relies on continuously monitoring the island's charge parity using microwave reflectometry. This scheme achieves 10% detection efficiency with sub 50 ns time resolution and short dead time 1 microsecond, for microwave photons at 10 GHz. The detector features three junctions connected to a superconducting island, which together carry out photoelectric conversion and charge readout. The enhanced light-matter coupling, crucial to photon to quasiparticle conversion, is provided by a granular aluminum-based high-impedance microwave resonator. The time resolved detection of itinerant microwave photon opens up new perspectives in quantum sensing, microwave quantum optics, readout of superconducting qubits and mesoscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Efficient prediction of topological superlattice bands with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a symmetry indicator framework to efficiently predict the topology of superlattice-induced minibands with spin-orbit coupling. Our algorithm requires input only from the parent material before the superlattice is applied. The simplification arises by assuming a perturbatively weak superlattice potential; however, our results extend beyond the perturbative regime as long as the superlattice-induced gaps remain open. We first consider a time-reversal- and inversion-symmetric system subject to a weak superlattice potential and derive a compact formula for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of the lowest miniband. We then extend to time-reversal breaking systems and compute the Chern number. We apply our theory to selected transition metal dichalcogenides, HgTe/CdTe quantum wells, and thin films of three-dimensional topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. We find topological superlattice bands can arise even from non-topological materials, broadening the pool of candidates for realizing topological flat bands. Our theory predicts which geometry and periodicity of superlattice will yield topological bands for a given material, providing a clear guiding principle for designing topological superlattice heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-spin decoupling for noise-resilient DC quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.</description>

We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator edges: crystalline effects and optical measurements</title>

Abstract: Edge states of chiral topologically ordered phases are commonly described by chiral Luttinger liquids, effective theories that are exact only in the hydrodynamic limit. Motivated by recent bulk observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in two-dimensional materials and by synthetic realizations in ultracold atoms, we revisit this framework and quantify deviations from the hydrodynamic limit due to lattice effects. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we disentangle universal from nonuniversal edge properties. We outline experimental probes in excitonic FCIs and in ultracold atom systems, and in particular propose time-resolved edge spectroscopy to directly access the predicted exponents and velocities.</description>

      <title>Method for rapid estimation of the energy-time covariance matrix of single electrons</title>

Abstract: The ability to emit and control single electrons in a dynamical manner enables their use in electron quantum optics and sensing. To characterize the electron states emitted with energy far above the Fermi energy, a dynamic barrier has been used. In this work, we extract the energy-time covariance matrix of single electrons by analyzing the energy variance obtained from the transconductance through the dynamic barrier. This method enables efficient and precise characterization of electron states, especially when a sinusoidal waveform is used. An effective phase-space area and the elliptical distribution are constructed from the covariance matrix and qualitatively compared with the distribution reconstructed from a tomographic method. The area constrained by the uncertainty relation serves as a measure of proximity to the quantum limit. Our results demonstrate an efficient method for characterizing electron states, paving the way for their application in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Hall Effect in Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Skyrmion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation high-speed and highly integrated spintronic devices, owing to their exceptional properties such as high driving velocity, nanoscale dimensions, and the absence of the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Higher Chern bands in helical homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose helically twisted homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as a platform for realizing correlated topological phases of matter with higher and tunable Chern numbers. We show that a clear separation of scales emerges for small twist angles, allowing us to derive a low-energy continuum model that captures the physics within moir\'e-scale domains. We identify regimes of twist angle and displacement field for which the highest-lying hole band is isolated from other bands and is topological with $K$-valley Chern number $C=-2$. We demonstrate that varying the displacement field can induce a transition from $C=-2$ to $C=-1$, as well as from a topologically trivial band to a $C=-1$ band. We derive an effective tight-binding description for a high-symmetry stacking domain which is valid for a wide range of twist angles, and we show that the $C=-2$ band can remain stable at filling fraction $\nu=-1$ in the presence of interactions in Hartree-Fock calculations.</description>

      <title>Exchange tensors, generalized RKKY interactions, and magnetization dynamics in heterostructures of ferromagnets and topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic (FM) layers interfaced with three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Integrating out the topological surface states and computing the spin determinant to second order in spins, we derive the effective generalized Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions mediated by topological surface states. These interactions inherently incorporate spin-momentum locking and anisotropic spin susceptibilities stemming from the Dirac-like dispersion of the TI surface electrons. The analysis reveals that the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling intrinsic to the TI and the magnetization in the FM layer induces highly nonlocal and retarded, chiral, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)-like contributions to the effective spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the spin dynamics is studied through a derivation of the LLG equation for this problem. The induced interactions renormalize many of the FM's intrinsic properties, but a new term in the LLG equation is induced that is related to the rate of change of the magnetization's curl, which is relevant to skyrmion dynamics. The magnon dispersion exhibits modifications due to the TI-mediated interactions, including a softened inertial spin-wave mode and tunable magnon gaps, sensitive to a tunable chemical potential and interfacial exchange coupling strength. The results also apply to finite temperatures. They elucidate topologically induced magnetic phenomena and pave the way for engineering exotic spin textures, such as skyrmions and chiral domain walls, in TI-FM hybrid systems with tunable interactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spin Transfer in WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructure Enabled by Direct Interlayer p-Orbital Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated efficient spin transfer across layers in the van der Waals heterostructure composed of WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, signaling a potential breakthrough in developing all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices. However, the reasons behind the unusually high interlayer spin transparency observed, despite the weak van der Waals interactions between layers, remain unclear. In this study, we employ density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method to explore this phenomenon. We find that the efficient cross-layer spin transfer arises from direct hybridization of p-orbitals between tellurium atoms at the interface. This interlayer orbital hybridization lowers the electronic potential barrier and significantly modifies the spin-polarized electronic structure of Fe3GeTe2. Consequently, an effective channel for spin-polarized transport is established between WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, leading to high interlayer spin transparency. Combining this enhanced spin transparency with the large spin Hall angle of WTe2 explains the high spin-orbit torque efficiency observed experimentally. Furthermore, we predict that applying a gate voltage can further increase this efficiency. Our findings offer a pathway for designing high-performance, all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH$_9$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.</description>

      <title>Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points</title>

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</description>
