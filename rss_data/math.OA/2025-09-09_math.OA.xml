      <title>Characterizations of zero singular ideal in \'etale groupoid C*-algebras via compressible maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the singular ideal in a non-Hausdorff \'etale groupoid C*-algebra is zero if and only if every unit is contained, at the level of group representation theory, in the collection of subgroups of the unit's isotropy group obtained as limit sets of nets in the "Hausdorff part" of the unit space. This is achieved through a study of the interplay between the Hausdorff cover and restriction maps on C*-algebras of groupoids to reductions by closed locally invariant subsets, which we show are compressible to *-homomorphisms and therefore have many of the same properties. We also prove a simpler algebraic characterization of zero singular ideal that holds whenever the isotropy group C*-algebras satisfy a certain ideal intersection property. We prove this property holds for all direct limits of virtually torsion free solvable groups.</description>

      <title>Simplicial sheaves of modules and Morita invariance of groupoid cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we develop a unified framework for proving Morita invariance of cohomology theories associated to Lie groupoids. Our approach is to view these cohomology theories as arising from sheaves of modules on the nerve of the groupoid. We establish criteria for when such sheaves of modules give rise to Morita invariant cohomology theories.</description>

      <title>Chern character for torsion-free ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an ample groupoid with torsion-free stabilizers, we construct a Chern character map going from the domain of the Baum-Connes assembly map of G to the groupoid homology groups of G with rational coefficients. As a main application, assuming the (rational) Baum-Connes conjecture, we prove the rational form of Matui's HK conjecture, i.e., we show that the operator K-groups of the groupoid C*-algebra are rationally isomorphic to the periodicized groupoid homology groups. Our construction hinges on the recent $\infty$-categorical viewpoint on bivariant K-theory, and does not rely on typical noncommutative geometry tools such as the Chern-Connes character and the periodic cyclic homology of smooth algebras. We also present applications to the homology of hyperbolic dynamical systems, the homology of topological full groups, the homotopy type of the algebraic K-theory spectrum of ample groupoids, and the Elliott invariant of classifiable C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of commutativity gadgets for entangled CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commutativity gadgets allow NP-hardness proofs for classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) to be carried over to undecidability proofs for the corresponding entangled CSPs. This has been done, for instance, for NP-complete boolean CSPs and 3-colouring in the work of Culf and Mastel. For many CSPs over larger alphabets, including $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$, it is not known whether or not commutativity gadgets exist, or if the entangled CSP is decidable. In this paper, we study commutativity gadgets and prove the first known obstruction to their existence. We do this by extending the definition of the quantum automorphism group of a graph to the quantum endomorphism monoid of a CSP, and showing that a CSP with non-classical quantum endomorphism monoid does not admit a commutativity gadget. In particular, this shows that no commutativity gadget exists for $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$. However, we construct a commutativity gadget for an alternate way of presenting $k$-colouring as a nonlocal game, the oracular setting.
  Furthermore, we prove an easy to check sufficient condition for the quantum endomorphism monoid to be non-classical, extending a result of Schmidt for the quantum automorphism group of a graph, and use this to give examples of CSPs that do not admit a commutativity gadget. We also show that existence of oracular commutativity gadgets is preserved under categorical powers of graphs; existence of commutativity gadgets and oracular commutativity gadgets is equivalent for graphs with no four-cycle; and that the odd cycles and the odd graphs have a commutative quantum endomorphism monoid, leaving open the possibility that they might admit a commutativity gadget.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on $M_d$-multipliers and approximation properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an extension property for $M_d$-multipliers from a subgroup to the ambient group, showing that $M_{d+1}(G)$ is strictly contained in $M_d(G)$ whenever $G$ contains a free subgroup. Another consequence of this result is the stability of the $M_d$-approximation property under group extensions. We also show that Baumslag-Solitar groups are $M_d$-weakly amenable with $\boldsymbol\Lambda(\operatorname{BS}(m,n),d)=1$ for all $d\geq 2$. Finally, we show that, for simple Lie groups with finite centre, $M_d$-weak amenability is equivalent to weak amenability, and we provide some estimates on the constants $\boldsymbol\Lambda(G,d)$.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Regularity Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of regularity structures [Hai14] to allow processes belonging to locally $m$-convex topological algebras. This extension includes processes in the locally $C^{*}$-algebras of [CHP25] used to localise singular stochastic partial differential equations involving fermions, as well as processes in Banach algebras such as infinite-dimensional semicircular\circular Brownian motion, and more generally the $q$-Gaussians of [BS91, BKS97, Bo\.z99].
  A new challenge we encounter in the $q$-Gaussian setting with $q \in (-1,1)$ are noncommutative renormalisation estimates where we must estimate operators in homogeneous $q$-Gaussian chaoses with arbitrary operator insertions. We introduce a new Banach algebra norm on $q$-Gaussian operators that allows us to control such insertions; we believe this construction could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the operator extension of strong subadditivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the operator extension of the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy $\rho_{AB} \otimes \sigma_{C}^{-1} \leq \rho_{A} \otimes \sigma_{BC}^{-1}$ by identifying the mathematical structure behind it as Connes' theory of spatial derivatives. This immediately generalizes the inequality to arbitrary inclusions of von Neumann algebras. In the case of standard representations, it reduces to the monotonicity of the relative modular operator.</description>
