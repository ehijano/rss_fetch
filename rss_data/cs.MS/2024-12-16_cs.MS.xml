      <title>TIGRE v3: Efficient and easy to use iterative computed tomographic reconstruction toolbox for real datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) has been widely adopted in medicine and it is increasingly being used in scientific and industrial applications. Parallelly, research in different mathematical areas concerning discrete inverse problems has led to the development of new sophisticated numerical solvers that can be applied in the context of CT. The Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction (TIGRE) toolbox was born almost a decade ago precisely in the gap between mathematics and high performance computing for real CT data, providing user-friendly open-source software tools for image reconstruction. However, since its inception, the tools' features and codebase have had over a twenty-fold increase, and are now including greater geometric flexibility, a variety of modern algorithms for image reconstruction, high-performance computing features and support for other CT modalities, like proton CT. The purpose of this work is two-fold: first, it provides a structured overview of the current version of the TIGRE toolbox, providing appropriate descriptions and references, and serving as a comprehensive and peer-reviewed guide for the user; second, it is an opportunity to illustrate the performance of several of the available solvers showcasing real CT acquisitions, which are typically not be openly available to algorithm developers.</description>

      <title>Invariant Polydiagonal Subspaces of Matrices and Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a polydiagonal subspace of the Euclidean space, certain components of the vectors are equal (synchrony) or opposite (anti-synchrony). Polydiagonal subspaces invariant under a matrix have many applications in graph theory and dynamical systems, especially coupled cell networks. We describe invariant polydiagonal subspaces in terms of coloring vectors. This approach gives an easy formulation of a constraint satisfaction problem for finding invariant polydiagonal subspaces. Solving the resulting problem with existing state-of-the-art constraint solvers greatly outperforms the currently known algorithms.</description>
