      <title>Certificates and Witnesses for Multi-Objective Queries in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying verification algorithms not only return whether a given property holds or not, but also provide an accompanying independently checkable certificate and a corresponding witness. The certificate can be used to easily validate the correctness of the result and the witness provides useful diagnostic information, e.g. for debugging purposes. Thus, certificates and witnesses substantially increase the trustworthiness and understandability of the verification process. In this work, we consider certificates and witnesses for multi-objective reachability-invariant and mean-payoff queries in Markov decision processes, that is conjunctions or disjunctions either of reachability and invariant or mean-payoff predicates, both universally and existentially quantified. Thereby, we generalize previous works on certificates and witnesses for single reachability and invariant constraints. To this end, we turn known linear programming techniques into certifying algorithms and show that witnesses in the form of schedulers and subsystems can be obtained. As a proof-of-concept, we report on implementations of certifying verification algorithms and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Linear equations with monomial constraints and decision problems in abelian-by-cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable whether a system of linear equations over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$ admit solutions where a specified subset of variables take value in the set of monomials $\{X^z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. In particular, we construct a finitely presented $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$-module, where it is undecidable whether a linear equation $X^{z_1} \boldsymbol{f}_1 + \cdots + X^{z_n} \boldsymbol{f}_n = \boldsymbol{f}_0$ has solutions $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This contrasts the decidability of the case $n = 1$, which can be deduced from Noskov's Lemma.
  As applications, we show that there exists a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group in which the Knapsack Problem is undecidable, and in which the problem of solving quadratic equations is also undecidable. In contrast, we show that the problem of Coset Intersection is decidable in all finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic groups.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly Unfolding with Optimal Exploration for Linear Temporal Logic Model Checking of Concurrent Software and Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Linear temporal logic (LTL) model checking faces a significant challenge known as the state-explosion problem. The on-the-fly method is a solution that constructs and checks the state space simultaneously, avoiding generating all states in advance. But it is not effective for concurrent interleaving. Unfolding based on Petri nets is a succinct structure covering all states that can mitigate this problem caused by concurrency. Many state-of-the-art methods optimally explore a complete unfolding structure using a tree-like structure. However, it is difficult to apply such a tree-like structure directly to the traditional on-the-fly method of LTL. At the same time, constructing a complete unfolding structure in advance and then checking LTL is also wasteful. Thus, the existing optimal exploration methods are not applicable to the on-the-fly unfolding. Objective: To solve these challenges, we propose an LTL model-checking method called on-the-fly unfolding with optimal exploration. This method is based on program dependence net (PDNet) proposed in the previous work. Method: Firstly, we define conflict transitions of PDNet and an exploration tree with a novel notion of delayed transitions, which differs from the existing tree-like structure. The tree improves the on-the-fly unfolding by exploring each partial-order run only once and avoiding enumerating all possible combinations. Then, we propose an on-the-fly unfolding algorithm that simultaneously constructs the exploration tree and generates the unfolding structure while checking LTL. Results: We implement a tool for concurrent programs. It also improves traditional unfolding generations and performs better than SPIN and DiVine on the used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Formal Proof of R(4,5)=25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1995, McKay and Radziszowski proved that the Ramsey number R(4,5) is equal to 25. Their proof relies on a combination of high-level arguments and computational steps. The authors have performed the computational parts of the proof with different implementations in order to reduce the possibility of an error in their programs. In this work, we prove this theorem in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 limiting the uncertainty to the small HOL4 kernel. Instead of verifying their algorithms directly, we rely on the HOL4 interface to MiniSat SAT to prove gluing lemmas. To reduce the number of such lemmas and thus make the computational part of the proof feasible, we implement a generalization algorithm. We verify that its output covers all the possible cases by implementing a custom SAT-solver extended with a graph isomorphism checker.</description>

      <title>LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07647v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic approach to learn semantic video representations that capture rich spatial and temporal properties in video data by leveraging high-level logic specifications. In particular, we formulate the problem in terms of alignment between raw videos and spatio-temporal logic specifications. The alignment algorithm leverages a differentiable symbolic reasoner and a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. It effectively and efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained video representation in the form of a spatio-temporal scene graph that conforms to the desired high-level specification. To practically reduce the manual effort of obtaining ground truth labels, we derive logic specifications from captions by employing a large language model with a generic prompting template. In doing so, we explore a novel methodology that weakly supervises the learning of spatio-temporal scene graphs with widely accessible video-caption data. We evaluate our method on three datasets with rich spatial and temporal specifications: 20BN-Something-Something, MUGEN, and OpenPVSG. We demonstrate that our method learns better fine-grained video semantics than existing baselines.</description>
