      <title>A Unified Toll Lane Framework for Autonomous and High-Occupancy Vehicles in Interactive Mixed Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a toll lane framework that optimizes the mixed flow of autonomous and high-occupancy vehicles on freeways, where human-driven and autonomous vehicles of varying commuter occupancy share a segment. Autonomous vehicles, with their ability to maintain shorter headways, boost traffic throughput. Our framework designates a toll lane for autonomous vehicles with high occupancy to use free of charge, while others pay a toll. We explore the lane choice equilibria when all vehicles minimize travel costs, and characterize the equilibria by ranking vehicles by their mobility enhancement potential, a concept we term the mobility degree. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the framework's utility in addressing design challenges such as setting optimal tolls, determining occupancy thresholds, and designing lane policies, showing how it facilitates the integration of high-occupancy and autonomous vehicles. We also propose an algorithm for assigning rational tolls to decrease total commuter delay and examine the effects of toll non-compliance. Our findings suggest that self-interest-driven behavior mitigates moderate non-compliance impacts, highlighting the framework's resilience. This work presents a pioneering comprehensive analysis of a toll lane framework that emphasizes the coexistence of autonomous and high-occupancy vehicles, offering insights for traffic management improvements and the integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation infrastructures.</description>

      <title>The Role of Transparency in Repeated First-Price Auctions with Unknown Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of regret minimization for a single bidder in a sequence of first-price auctions where the bidder discovers the item's value only if the auction is won. Our main contribution is a complete characterization, up to logarithmic factors, of the minimax regret in terms of the auction's \emph{transparency}, which controls the amount of information on competing bids disclosed by the auctioneer at the end of each auction. Our results hold under different assumptions (stochastic, adversarial, and their smoothed variants) on the environment generating the bidder's valuations and competing bids. These minimax rates reveal how the interplay between transparency and the nature of the environment affects how fast one can learn to bid optimally in first-price auctions.</description>

      <title>Resolving social dilemmas with minimal reward transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent cooperation is an important topic, and is particularly challenging in mixed-motive situations where it does not pay to be nice to others. Consequently, self-interested agents often avoid collective behaviour, resulting in suboptimal outcomes for the group. In response, in this paper we introduce a metric to quantify the disparity between what is rational for individual agents and what is rational for the group, which we call the general self-interest level. This metric represents the maximum proportion of individual rewards that all agents can retain while ensuring that achieving social welfare optimum becomes a dominant strategy. By aligning the individual and group incentives, rational agents acting to maximise their own reward will simultaneously maximise the collective reward. As agents transfer their rewards to motivate others to consider their welfare, we diverge from traditional concepts of altruism or prosocial behaviours. The general self-interest level is a property of a game that is useful for assessing the propensity of players to cooperate and understanding how features of a game impact this. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on several novel games representations of social dilemmas with arbitrary numbers of players.</description>

      <title>Designing Digital Voting Systems for Citizens: Achieving Fairness and Legitimacy in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) has evolved into a key democratic instrument for resource allocation in cities. Enabled by digital platforms, cities now have the opportunity to let citizens directly propose and vote on urban projects, using different voting input and aggregation rules. However, the choices cities make in terms of the rules of their PB have often not been informed by academic studies on voter behaviour and preferences. Therefore, this work presents the results of behavioural experiments where participants were asked to vote in a fictional PB setting. We identified approaches to designing PB voting that minimise cognitive load and enhance the perceived fairness and legitimacy of the digital process from the citizens' perspective. In our study, participants preferred voting input formats that are more expressive (like rankings and distributing points) over simpler formats (like approval voting). Participants also indicated a desire for the budget to be fairly distributed across city districts and project categories. Participants found the Method of Equal Shares voting rule to be fairer than the conventional Greedy voting rule. These findings offer actionable insights for digital governance, contributing to the development of fairer and more transparent digital systems and collective decision-making processes for citizens.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dominance Hierarchies in Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12258v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are able to outperform humans in a wide variety of tasks. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings present additional challenges, and successful cooperation in mixed-motive groups of agents depends on a delicate balancing act between individual and group objectives. Social conventions and norms, often inspired by human institutions, are used as tools for striking this balance.
  In this paper, we examine a fundamental, well-studied social convention that underlies cooperation in both animal and human societies: dominance hierarchies.
  We adapt the ethological theory of dominance hierarchies to artificial agents, borrowing the established terminology and definitions with as few amendments as possible. We demonstrate that populations of RL agents, operating without explicit programming or intrinsic rewards, can invent, learn, enforce, and transmit a dominance hierarchy to new populations. The dominance hierarchies that emerge have a similar structure to those studied in chickens, mice, fish, and other species.</description>
