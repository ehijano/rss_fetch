      <title>Strategic Informed Trading and the Value of Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a market of risky financial assets where the participants are an informed trader, a mass of uniformed traders and noisy liquidity providers. We prove the existence of a market-clearing equilibrium when the insider internalizes her power to impact prices. In the price-impact equilibrium the insider strategically reveals a noisier (compared to when the insider takes prices as given) signal, and prices are less reactive to the publicly available information. In contrast to the related literature, we show that in the price-impact equilibrium, the insider's ex-ante welfare monotonically increases in the signal precision. This clarifies when a trader with market power is motivated to both obtain and refine her private information. Furthermore, even though the uniformed traders act as price-takers, the effect of price impact is ex-ante welfare improving for them. By contrast, internalization of price impact may reduce insider ex-ante welfare. This happens provided the insider is sufficiently risk averse and the uninformed traders are sufficiently risk tolerant.</description>

      <title>DEX Specs: A Mean Field Approach to DeFi Currency Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of liquidity providers (LPs) by modeling a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) based on Uniswap v3. LPs with heterogeneous characteristics choose optimal liquidity positions subject to uncertainty regarding the size of exogenous incoming transactions and the prices of assets in the wider market. They engage in a game among themselves, and the resulting liquidity distribution determines the exchange rate dynamics and potential arbitrage opportunities of the pool. We calibrate the distribution of LP characteristics based on Uniswap data and the equilibrium strategy resulting from this mean-field game produces pool exchange rate dynamics and liquidity evolution consistent with observed pool behavior. We subsequently introduce Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots who perform Just-In-Time (JIT) liquidity attacks, and develop a Stackelberg game between LPs and bots. This addition results in more accurate simulated pool exchange rate dynamics and stronger predictive power regarding the evolution of the pool liquidity distribution.</description>

      <title>Targeted aspect-based emotion analysis to detect opportunities and precaution in financial Twitter messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microblogging platforms, of which Twitter is a representative example, are valuable information sources for market screening and financial models. In them, users voluntarily provide relevant information, including educated knowledge on investments, reacting to the state of the stock markets in real-time and, often, influencing this state. We are interested in the user forecasts in financial, social media messages expressing opportunities and precautions about assets. We propose a novel Targeted Aspect-Based Emotion Analysis (TABEA) system that can individually discern the financial emotions (positive and negative forecasts) on the different stock market assets in the same tweet (instead of making an overall guess about that whole tweet). It is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning streaming algorithms. The system comprises a constituency parsing module for parsing the tweets and splitting them into simpler declarative clauses; an offline data processing module to engineer textual, numerical and categorical features and analyse and select them based on their relevance; and a stream classification module to continuously process tweets on-the-fly. Experimental results on a labelled data set endorse our solution. It achieves over 90% precision for the target emotions, financial opportunity, and precaution on Twitter. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work in the literature has addressed this problem despite its practical interest in decision-making, and we are not aware of any previous NLP nor online Machine Learning approaches to TABEA.</description>
