      <title>LinApart: optimizing the univariate partial fraction decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LinApart, a routine designed for efficiently performing the univariate partial fraction decomposition of large symbolic expressions. Our method is based on an explicit closed formula for the decomposition of rational functions with fully factorized denominators. We provide implementations in both the Wolfram Mathematica and C languages, made available at https://github.com/fekeshazy/LinApart . The routine can provide very significant performance gains over available tools such as the Apart command in Mathematica.</description>

      <title>ParSEL: Parameterized Shape Editing with Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to edit 3D assets from natural language presents a compelling paradigm to aid in the democratization of 3D content creation. However, while natural language is often effective at communicating general intent, it is poorly suited for specifying precise manipulation. To address this gap, we introduce ParSEL, a system that enables controllable editing of high-quality 3D assets from natural language. Given a segmented 3D mesh and an editing request, ParSEL produces a parameterized editing program. Adjusting the program parameters allows users to explore shape variations with a precise control over the magnitudes of edits. To infer editing programs which align with an input edit request, we leverage the abilities of large-language models (LLMs). However, while we find that LLMs excel at identifying initial edit operations, they often fail to infer complete editing programs, and produce outputs that violate shape semantics. To overcome this issue, we introduce Analytical Edit Propagation (AEP), an algorithm which extends a seed edit with additional operations until a complete editing program has been formed. Unlike prior methods, AEP searches for analytical editing operations compatible with a range of possible user edits through the integration of computer algebra systems for geometric analysis. Experimentally we demonstrate ParSEL's effectiveness in enabling controllable editing of 3D objects through natural language requests over alternative system designs.</description>

      <title>Certified homotopy tracking using the Krawczyk method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of certifying the correctness of approximate solution paths computed by numerical homotopy continuation methods. We propose a conceptually simple approach based on a parametric variant of the Krawczyk method from interval arithmetic. Unlike most previous methods for certified path-tracking, our approach is applicable in the general setting of parameter homotopies commonly used to solve polynomial systems of equations. We also describe a novel preconditioning strategy and give theoretical correctness and termination results. Experiments using a preliminary implementation of the method indicate that our approach is competitive with specialized methods appearing previously in the literature, in spite of our more general setting.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Bounds on the Reach of an Algebraic Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separation bounds are a fundamental measure of the complexity of solving a zero-dimensional system as it measures how difficult it is to separate its zeroes. In the positive dimensional case, the notion of reach takes its place. In this paper, we provide bounds on the reach of a smooth algebraic variety in terms of several invariants of interest: the condition number, Smale's $\gamma$ and the bit-size. We also provide probabilistic bounds for random algebraic varieties under some general assumptions.</description>
