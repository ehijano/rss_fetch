      <title>Unsupervised full-field Bayesian inference of orthotropic hyperelasticity from a single biaxial test: a myocardial case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully capturing this behavior in traditional homogenized tissue testing requires the excitation of multiple deformation modes, i.e. combined triaxial shear tests and biaxial stretch tests. Inherently, such multimodal experimental protocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample manipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced tissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue behavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention to the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation problem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the automated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter identification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a Bayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We showcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the material model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single heterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the ground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work highlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic material models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>What the %PCSA? Addressing Diversity in Lower-Limb Musculoskeletal Models: Age- and Sex-related Differences in PCSA and Muscle Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) models offer a non-invasive way to understand biomechanical loads on joints and tendons, which are difficult to measure directly. Variations in muscle strength, especially relative differences between muscles, significantly impact model outcomes. Typically, scaled generic MSK models use maximum isometric forces that are not adjusted for different demographics, raising concerns about their accuracy. This review provides an overview on experimentally derived strength parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), muscle mass (Mm), and relative muscle mass (%Mm), which is the relative distribution of muscle mass across the leg. We analysed differences by age and sex, and compared open-source lower limb MSK model parameters with experimental data from 57 studies. Our dataset, with records dating back to 1884, shows that uniformly increasing all maximum isometric forces in MSK models does not capture key muscle ratio differences due to age and sex. Males have a higher proportion of muscle mass in the rectus femoris and semimembranosus muscles, while females have a greater relative muscle mass in the pelvic (gluteus maximus and medius) and ankle muscles (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and extensor digitorum longus). Older adults have a higher relative muscle mass in the gluteus medius, while younger individuals show more in the gastrocnemius. Current MSK models do not accurately represent muscle mass distribution for specific age or sex groups, and none of them accurately reflect female muscle mass distribution. Further research is needed to explore musculotendon age- and sex differences.</description>

      <title>Towards deep-learning based detection and quantification of intestinal metaplasia on digitized gastric biopsies: a multi-expert comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current gastric cancer (GCa) risk systems are prone to errors since they evaluate a visual estimation of intestinal metaplasia percentages in histopathology images of gastric mucosa to assign a risk. This study presents an automated method to detect and quantify intestinal metaplasia using deep convolutional neural networks as well as a comparative analysis with visual estimations of three pathologists. Gastric samples were collected from two different cohorts: 149 asymptomatic volunteers from a region with a high prevalence of GCa in Colombia and 56 patients from a tertiary hospital. Deep learning models were trained to classify intestinal metaplasia, and predictions were used to estimate a percentage of intestinal metaplasia and to assign an adapted OLGIM stage. Atrophy was not assessed because of the limited reproducibility among pathologists. Results were compared with independent blinded metaplastic assessments performed by three graduated pathologists. The best-performing deep learning architecture classified intestinal metaplasia with F1-Score of 0.80 +- 0.01 and AUC of 0.91 +- 0.01. Among pathologists, inter-observer agreement by a Fleiss's Kappa score ranged from 0.20 to 0.48. In comparison, agreement between the pathologists and the best-performing model ranged from 0.12 to 0.35. Deep learning models show potential to reliably detect and quantify the percentage of intestinal metaplasia, achieving high classification performance. In practice, visual estimation is still the only available method, yet it is marked by considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning models provide consistent estimates that could help reduce this subjectivity in risk stratification.</description>

      <title>MAE-SAM2: Mask Autoencoder-Enhanced SAM2 for Clinical Retinal Vascular Leakage Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10554v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.</description>
