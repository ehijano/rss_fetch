      <title>Biaxialformer: Leveraging Channel Independence and Inter-Channel Correlations in EEG Signal Decoding for Predicting Neurological Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of EEG signals requires comprehensive modeling of both temporal dynamics within individual channels and spatial dependencies across channels. While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI) strategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks, they often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in multivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and reduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological outcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer, characterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework. This model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and channel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual reinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint learning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and spatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation forgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a tokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of fine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance spatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture inter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in EEG analysis. Our study broadens the use of Transformer-based models by addressing the challenge of predicting neurological outcomes in comatose patients. Using the multicenter I-CARE data from five hospitals, we validate the robustness and generalizability of Biaxialformer with an average AUC 0.7688, AUPRC 0.8643, and F1 0.6518 in a cross-hospital scenario.</description>

      <title>Cross-Comparison of Neural Architectures and Data Sets for Digital Self-Interference Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inband full-duplex communication requires accurate modeling and cancellation of self-interference, specifically in the digital domain. Neural networks are presently candidate models for capturing nonlinearity of the self-interference path. This work utilizes synthetic and real data from different sources to evaluate and cross-compare performances of previously proposed neural self-interference models from different sources. The relevance of the analysis consists in the mutual assessment of methods on data they were not specifically designed for. We find that our previously proposed Hammerstein model represents the range of data sets well, while being significantly smaller in terms of the number of parameters. A new Wiener-Hammerstein model further enhances the generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Satellite Quantum Key Distribution with Dual Band Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel system architecture for hybrid satellite communications, integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) and classical radio frequency (RF) data transmission using a dual-band reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The motivation is to address the growing need for global, secure, and reliable communications by leveraging the security of quantum optical links and the robustness of classical RF channels within a unified framework. By employing a frequency-selective RIS, the system independently optimizes both quantum (850 nm) and classical (S-band) channels in real time, dynamically adapting to environmental fluctuations such as atmospheric turbulence and rain attenuation. The joint optimization of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the classical signal-to noise ratio (SNR) is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling efficient adaptive phase control utilizing both quantum and classical computational methods. Comprehensive theoretical modeling and simulations, benchmarked against experimental data from the Micius satellite, demonstrate substantial performance gains. Notably, the RIS assisted system reduces QBER from approximately 2.5% to 0.7%, increases the secure key rate (SKR) to over 30,000 bits per second, and enhances classical RF SNR by about 3 dB at high elevation angles. These results illustrate the practical potential of hybrid RIS-assisted satellite links to deliver robust, efficient, and secure global communications.</description>

      <title>Specific Absorption Rate-Aware Multiuser MIMO Assisted by Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, there is a pressing need for innovative technologies capable of satisfying heightened performance indicators. Fluid antenna system (FAS) is proposed recently as a promising technique to achieve higher data rates and more diversity gains by dynamically changing the positions of the antennas to form a more desirable channel. However, worries regarding the possibly harmful effects of electromagnetic (EM) radiation emitted by devices have arisen as a result of the rapid evolution of advanced techniques in wireless communication systems. Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a widely adopted metric to quantify EM radiation worldwide. In this paper, we investigate the SAR-aware multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications assisted by FAS. In particular, a two-layer iterative algorithm is proposed to minimize the SAR value under signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and FAS constraints. Moreover, the minimum weighted SINR maximization problem under SAR and FAS constraints is studied by finding its relationship with the SAR minimization problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed SAR-aware FAS design outperforms the adaptive backoff and fixed-position antenna designs.</description>

      <title>UWB TDoA Error Correction using Transformers: Patching and Positional Encoding Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, UWB-based localization systems suffer inaccuracies when deployed in industrial locations with many obstacles due to multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In such environments, current error mitigation approaches for time difference of arrival (TDoA) localization typically exclude NLOS links. However, this exclusion approach leads to geometric dilution of precision problems and this approach is infeasible when the majority of links are NLOS. To address these limitations, we propose a transformer-based TDoA position correction method that uses raw channel impulse responses (CIRs) from all available anchor nodes to compute position corrections. We introduce different CIR ordering, patching and positional encoding strategies for the transformer, and analyze each proposed technique's scalability and performance gains. Based on experiments on real-world UWB measurements, our approach can provide accuracies of up to 0.39 m in a complex environment consisting of (almost) only NLOS signals, which is an improvement of 73.6 % compared to the TDoA baseline.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representation of Beamforming for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a learning-based approach for optimizing downlink beamforming in continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed, where a MIMO scenario that both the base station (BS) and the user are equipped with CAPA is considered. As the beamforming in the CAPA system is a function that maps a coordinate on the aperture to the beamforming weight at the coordinate, a DNN called BeaINR is proposed to parameterize this function, which is called implicit neural representation (INR). We further find that the optimal beamforming function lies in the subspace of channel function, i.e., it can be expressed as a weighted integral of channel function. Based on this finding, we propose another DNN called CoefINR to learn the weighting coefficient with INR, which has lower complexity than learning the beamforming function with BeaINR. Simulation results show that the proposed INR-based methods outperform numerical baselines in both spectral efficiency (SE) and inference time, with CoefINR offering additional training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multipath-Enhanced Measurement of Antenna Patterns: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional antenna pattern measurements involve minimizing the impact of multipath propagation in the measurement environment. In contrast, this work introduces a measurement approach that uses rather than mitigates multipath propagation. This is referred to as the Multipath-Enhanced Antenna Pattern (MEAP) Measurement technique. In this respect the approach has some kinship with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. The advantage in the case of MIMO systems is increased capacity; in the MEAP approach the advantage is elimination of the need for creating an anechoic environment. The approach uses measurements with reference antennas to calibrate the multipath channel matrix, and vector spherical harmonics for efficient pattern representation. After presenting the mathematical details of the method, numerical calculations illustrating the approach are presented. Experimental results are described in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a companion paper we presented the theory for an antenna pattern measuring technique that uses (rather than mitigates) the properties of a multipath environment. Here we use measurements in a typical home garage to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the technique. A half-wavelength electric dipole with different orientations was used as both the calibration and test antennas. For simplicity, we limited the modeling of the antenna pattern to using only the three $l=1$ vector spherical harmonics. Three methods were used to analyze the measurements: a matrix inversion method using only 3 sense antennas, a least-square-error technique, and a least-square-error technique with a constant power constraint imposed. The two least-square-error techniques used the measurements from 10 sense antennas. The constrained least-square-error technique was found to give the best results.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Data Detection in the THz-Band under Channel-Correlated Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive symbol error rate (SER) analysis framework for link-level terahertz (THz)-band communication systems under linear zero-forcing (ZF) data detection. First, we derive the mismatched SER for indoor THz systems under independent channel and noise assumptions, calculating the probability density function of the ratio of Gaussian noise to $\alpha$-$\mu$ channels resulting from ZF filtering. Next, we derive the precise SER under correlated channel and noise conditions, modeling dependencies using the copula method. Finally, we evaluate the SER for THz channels with correlated distortion noise from hardware impairments. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework corrects for multi-dB SERs resulting from the channel-noise independence assumption.</description>

      <title>Improving SAGIN Resilience to Jamming with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the anti-jamming space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) scenario wherein a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed on a fixed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to counteract malevolent jamming attacks. In contrast to existing research, in this paper, we consider that a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite is sending the signal to the user on the ground in the presence of jamming from a Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO) satellite side. We aim to maximize the signal-to-jamming plus noise ratio (SJNR) by optimizing the RIS beamforming and transmit power of the LEO satellite. Assuming the availability of global channel state information (CSI) at the RIS, we propose alternating optimization (AO) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to address the complexity. Simulation results show that the optimization schemes lead to considerable performance improvements. The results also indicate that, given the high jamming power and the relatively small number of RIS elements, deploying the RIS on UAVs near the user is more effective in mitigating the impact of jamming interferers.</description>

      <title>SHAP-AAD: DeepSHAP-Guided Channel Reduction for EEG Auditory Attention Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based auditory attention detection (AAD) offers a non-invasive way to enhance hearing aids, but conventional methods rely on too many electrodes, limiting wearability and comfort. This paper presents SHAP-AAD, a two-stage framework that combines DeepSHAP-based channel selection with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) for efficient AAD using fewer channels.DeepSHAP, an explainable AI technique, is applied to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on topographic alpha-power maps to rank channel importance, and the top-k EEG channels are used to train a compact TCN. Experiments on the DTU dataset show that using 32 channels yields comparable accuracy to the full 64-channel setup (79.21% vs. 81.06%) on average. In some cases, even 8 channels can deliver satisfactory accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SHAP-AAD in reducing complexity while preserving high detection performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Node Localization for Rough and Extreme Deployment Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications have been identified which require the deployment of large-scale low-power wireless sensor networks. Some of the deployment environments, however, impose harsh operation conditions due to intense cross-technology interference, extreme weather conditions (heavy rainfall, excessive heat, etc.), or rough motion, thereby affecting the quality and predictability of the wireless links the nodes establish. In localization tasks, these conditions often lead to significant errors in estimating the position of target nodes. Motivated by the practical deployments of sensors on the surface of different water bodies, we address the problem of identifying susceptible nodes and robustly estimating their positions. We formulate these tasks as a compressive sensing problem and propose algorithms for both node identification and robust estimation. Additionally, we design an optimal anchor configuration to maximize the robustness of the position estimation task. Our numerical results and comparisons with competitive methods demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve both objectives with a modest number of anchors. Since our method relies only on target-to-anchor distances, it is broadly applicable and yields resilient, robust localization.</description>

      <title>A Variational Bayesian Detector for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a variational Bayesian (VB) detector for affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) systems. The proposed method estimates the symbol probability distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true posterior and an approximate distribution, thereby enabling low-complexity soft-decision detection. Compared to conventional approaches such as zero-forcing (ZF), Linear minimum mean square rrror (LMMSE), and the message passing algorithm (MPA), the proposed detector demonstrates lower bit error rates (BER), faster convergence, and improved robustness under complex multipath channels. Simulation results confirm its dual advantages in computational efficiency and detection performance.</description>

      <title>Structure from Noise: Confirmation Bias in Particle Picking in Structural Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confirmation bias is a fundamental challenge in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), where prior expectations can lead to systematic errors in data interpretation. This bias may emerge at multiple stages of the reconstruction pipeline, and in particular in the critical particle picking stage, where 2D particles (in cryo-EM) or 3D subtomograms (in cryo-ET) are extracted from highly noisy micrographs or tomograms. Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and deep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled experiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can produce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from noise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows: the potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven bias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of such biases. Together, our findings deepen the theoretical understanding of confirmation bias in cryo-EM and cryo-ET and call for cautious interpretation of reconstructions, primarily when relying on template-driven particle picking.</description>

      <title>SAFERad: A Framework to Enable Radar Data for Safety-Relevant Perception Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar sensors play a crucial role for perception systems in automated driving but suffer from a high level of noise. In the past, this could be solved by strict filters, which remove most false positives at the expense of undetected objects. Future highly automated functions are much more demanding with respect to error rate. Hence, if the radar sensor serves as a component of perception systems for such functions, a simple filter strategy cannot be applied. In this paper, we present a modified filtering approach which is characterized by the idea to vary the filtering depending on the potential of harmful collision with the object which is potentially represented by the radar point. We propose an algorithm which determines a criticality score for each point based on the planned or presumable trajectory of the automated vehicle. Points identified as very critical can trigger manifold actions to confirm or deny object presence. Our pipeline introduces criticality regions. The filter threshold in these criticality regions is omitted. Commonly known radar data sets do not or barely feature critical scenes. Thus, we present an approach to evaluate our framework by adapting the planned trajectory towards vulnerable road users, which serve as ground truth critical points. Evaluation of the criticality metric prove high recall rates. Besides, our post-processing algorithm lowers the rate of non-clustered critical points by 74.8 % in an exemplary setup compared to a moderate, generic filter.</description>

      <title>MMOC: Self-Supervised EEG Emotion Recognition Framework with Multi-Model Online Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift, limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects. Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning, enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Detector for Faulty GNSS Measurements Detection With Non-Gaussian Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault detection is crucial to ensure the reliability of navigation systems. However, mainstream fault detection methods are developed based on Gaussian assumptions on nominal errors, while current attempts at non-Gaussian fault detection are either heuristic or lack rigorous statistical properties. The performance and reliability of these methods are challenged in real-world applications. This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection method tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under non-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife technique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement errors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while maintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni correction is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements. Theoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and the solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior computational efficiency. Through a worldwide simulation and a real-world satellite clock anomaly detection experiment--both involving non-Gaussian nominal errors--the proposed jackknife detector demonstrates equivalent detection performance to the SS detector but achieves a fourfold improvement in computational efficiency. These results highlight the jackknife detector's substantial potential for real-time applications requiring robust and efficient fault detection in non-Gaussian noise environments.</description>

      <title>Differentiable High-Performance Ray Tracing-Based Simulation of Radio Propagation with Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models augmented with semantic segmentation labels.
  In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.</description>

      <title>CSI-Free Symbol Detection for Atomic MIMO Receivers via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic receivers based on Rydberg vapor cells as sensors of electromagnetic fields offer a promising alternative to conventional radio frequency front-ends. In multi-antenna configurations, the magnitude-only, phase-insensitive measurements produced by atomic receivers pose challenges for traditional detection methods. Existing solutions rely on two-step iterative optimization processes, which suffer from cascaded channel estimation errors and high computational complexity. We propose a channel state information (CSI)-free symbol detection method based on in-context learning (ICL), which directly maps pilot-response pairs to data symbol predictions without explicit channel estimation. Simulation results show that ICL achieves competitive accuracy with {higher computational efficiency} compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Computational AoA Detection Using Conformal Frequency Diverse Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devices that detect angle-of-arrival (AoA) over a wide field of view are crucial for various applications such as wireless communication and navigation. They are often installed on platforms with challenging mechanical and stealth constraints like vehicles, drones, and helmets, where traditional methods -- mechanically rotating antennas or conformal arrays -- tend to be bulky, heavy, and costly. A recent work has proposed a conformal frequency diverse antenna that is designed to produce angularly diverse patterns that encode angular information into frequency sweeps. This capability allows AoA to be determined across the entire horizon using only two receiving units. This paper experimentally validates this concept, detailing the prototyping process and practical design considerations. The AoA detection capabilities of the proposed device are confirmed through experimental demonstrations. The proposed conformal metasurfaces offer an alternative hardware solution for sensing over large fields of view, with potential applications in radar sensing, situational awareness, and navigation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resource Management in Cognitive Radar via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, scanning for target detection, and multi-target tracking in a cognitive radar system are considered, and adaptive radar resource management is investigated. In particular, time management for radar scanning and tracking of multiple maneuvering targets subject to budget constraints is studied with the goal to jointly maximize the tracking and scanning performances of a cognitive radar. We tackle the constrained optimization problem of allocating the dwell time to track individual targets by employing a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based reinforcement learning approach. We propose a constrained deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) algorithm that updates the DDPG neural networks and dual variables simultaneously. Numerical results show that the radar can autonomously allocate time appropriately so as to maximize the reward function without exceeding the time constraint.</description>

      <title>High-Availability Integrity Monitoring for Multi-Constellation GNSS Navigation with Non-Gaussian Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation, requiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading information. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and advanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal errors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors with heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper proposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple simultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity monitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically exploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A tight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of hypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is examined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated based on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in existing research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical protection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than 50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings, baseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism induced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the proposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal operations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising potential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a decision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for multi-constellation GNSS applications.</description>

      <title>Near-Field ISAC for THz Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are expected not only to provide high-speed connectivity but also to support reliable sensing capabilities, giving rise to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm. To enable higher data rates and more accurate sensing, terahertz (THz) systems empowered by extremely large multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology are envisioned as key enablers for future ISAC systems. Owing to the substantial increase in both effective array aperture and carrier frequency, a considerable portion of future ISAC applications is anticipated to fall within the near-field coverage region, instead of the conventional far-field. However, most existing ISAC techniques are designed under the far-field planar wave assumption, struggling to accommodate the unique characteristics of THz near-field propagation. To motivate future research into near-field ISAC research, we systematically investigate the characteristics of THz near-field propagation and explore its potential to facilitate ISAC systems. Specifically, we analyze three fundamental characteristics of THz near-field propagation and review state-of-the-art techniques that exploit these features to boost both communication and sensing performance. To further harness the angular-range coupling effect, we zoom into a particularly interesting approach to near-field sensing based on wavenumber domain. Besides, to exploit the beam squint effect, an ISAC resource allocation framework is introduced to support integrated multi-angle sensing and multi-user communication. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research in this emerging area.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Deep Learning for Robust Channel Extrapolation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer remarkable spatial flexibility but face significant challenges in acquiring high-resolution channel state information (CSI), leading to considerable overhead. To address this issue, we propose CANet, a robust deep learning model for channel extrapolation in FAS. CANet combines context-adaptive modeling with a cross-scale attention mechanism and is built on a ConvNeXt v2 backbone to improve extrapolation accuracy for unobserved antenna ports. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a novel spatial amplitude perturbation strategy, inspired by frequency-domain augmentation techniques in image processing. This motivates the incorporation of a Fourier-domain loss function, capturing frequency-domain consistency, alongside a spectral structure consistency loss that reinforces learning stability under perturbations. Our simulation results demonstrate that CANet outperforms benchmark models across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Data Processing Efficiency in Blockchain Enabled Metaverse over Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Metaverse, enhanced by blockchain technology, the efficient processing of data has emerged as a critical challenge, especially in wireless communication systems. Addressing this challenge, our paper introduces the innovative concept of data processing efficiency (DPE), aiming to maximize processed bits per unit of resource consumption in blockchain-empowered Metaverse environments. To achieve this, we propose the DPE-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation (DAUR) algorithm, a tailored optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Metaverse wireless communication systems characterized by joint computing and communication resource constraints. The DAUR algorithm transforms the nonconvex problem of maximizing the sum of DPE ratios into a solvable convex optimization problem. It alternates the optimization of key variables, including user association, work offloading ratios, task-specific computing resource distribution, bandwidth allocation, user power usage ratios, and server computing resource allocation ratios. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate the DAUR algorithm's effectiveness in DPE.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Using Active mmWave Sensing in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G New Radio (NR) communication systems, with their high-resolution antenna arrays and extensive bandwidth, offer a transformative opportunity for high-throughput data transmission and advanced environmental sensing. Although passive sensing-based SLAM techniques can estimate user locations and environmental reflections simultaneously, their effectiveness is often constrained by assumptions of specular reflections and oversimplified map representations. To overcome these limitations, this work employs a mmWave 5G NR system for active sensing, enabling it to function similarly to a laser scanner for point cloud generation. Specifically, point clouds are extracted from the power delay profile estimated from each beam direction using a binary search approach. To ensure accuracy, hardware delays are calibrated with multiple predefined target points. Pose variations of the terminal are then estimated from point cloud data gathered along continuous trajectory viewpoints using point cloud registration algorithms. Loop closure detection and pose graph optimization are subsequently applied to refine the sensing results, achieving precise terminal localization and detailed radio map reconstruction. The system is implemented and validated through both simulations and experiments, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique that addresses big data collection and fast wireless data aggregation. However, in a network where wireless communication and AirComp coexist, mutual interference becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose to employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enable integrated communication and AirComp, where we capitalize on UAV mobility with alleviated interference for performance enhancement. Particularly, we aim to maximize the sum of user transmission rate with the guaranteed AirComp accuracy requirement, where we jointly optimize the transmission strategy, signal normalizing factor, scheduling strategy, and UAV trajectory. We decouple the formulated problem into two layers where the outer layer is for UAV trajectory and scheduling, and the inner layer is for transmission and computation. Then, we solve the inner layer problem through alternating optimization, and the outer layer is solved through soft actor critic based deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results show the convergence of the proposed learning process and also demonstrate the performance superiority of our proposal as compared with the baselines in various situations.</description>

      <title>Exploring O-RAN Compression Techniques in Decentralized Distributed MIMO Systems: Reducing Fronthaul Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of uplink fronthaul compression techniques within Open RAN (O-RAN) to mitigate fronthaul load in decentralized distributed MIMO (DD-MIMO) systems. With the ever-increasing demand for high data rates and system scalability, the fronthaul load becomes a critical bottleneck. Our method uses O-RAN compression techniques to efficiently compress the fronthaul signals. The goal is to greatly lower the fronthaul load while having little effect on the overall system performance, as shown by Block Error Rate (BLER) curves. Through rigorous link-level simulations, we compare our quantization strategies against a benchmark scenario with no quantization, providing insights into the trade-offs between fronthaul data rate reduction and link performance integrity. The results demonstrate that our proposed quantization techniques not only lower the fronthaul load but also maintain a competitive link quality, making them a viable solution for enhancing the efficiency of next-generation wireless networks. This study underscores the potential of quantization in O-RAN contexts to achieve optimal balance between system capacity and performance, paving the way for more scalable and robust DD-MIMO deployments.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Antenna Selection Technique for RIS-Empowered RQSM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has attracted considerable interest due to its ability to control wireless propagation with minimal power usage. Receive quadrature spatial modulation (RQSM) scheme transmits data bits in both in-phase ($I$) and quadrature ($Q$) channels, doubling the number of active receive antenna indices and improving spectral efficiency compared to the traditional receive spatial modulation (RSM) technique. Also, capacity-optimized antenna selection (COAS) improves error performance by selecting antennas with the best channel conditions. This paper proposes a new deep neural network (DNN)-based antenna selection method, supported by the COAS technique, to improve the error performance of the RIS-RQSM system. Monte Carlo simulations of the proposed DNN-COAS-RIS-RQSM system using the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) technique for Rayleigh fading channels are performed and compared with the COAS-RIS-RQSM system. Also, a comparative analysis of the computational complexities of the DNN and COAS techniques is conducted to evaluate the trade-offs between error performance and complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based Point Cloud Networks (PCNs) are powerful tools for processing sparse sensor data with irregular geometries, as found in high-energy physics detectors. However, deploying models in such environments remains challenging due to stringent real-time requirements for both latency, and throughput. In this work, we present a deeply pipelined dataflow architecture for executing graph-based PCNs on FPGAs. Our method supports efficient processing of dynamic, sparse point clouds while meeting hard real-time constraints. We introduce specialized processing elements for core graph operations, such as GraVNet convolution and condensation point clustering, and demonstrate our design on the AMD Versal VCK190. Compared to a GPU baseline, our FPGA implementation achieves up to 5.25x speedup in throughput while maintaining latencies below 10 {\mu}s, satisfying the demands of real-time trigger systems in particle physics experiments. An open-source reference implementation is provided.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being integrated into next-generation networks to enhance communication coverage and network capacity. However, the dynamic and mobile nature of UAVs poses significant security challenges, including jamming, eavesdropping, and cyber-attacks. To address these security challenges, this paper proposes a federated learning-based lightweight network with zero trust for enhancing the security of UAV networks. A novel lightweight spectrogram network is proposed for UAV authentication and rejection, which can effectively authenticate and reject UAVs based on spectrograms. Experiments highlight LSNet's superior performance in identifying both known and unknown UAV classes, demonstrating significant improvements over existing benchmarks in terms of accuracy, model compactness, and storage requirements. Notably, LSNet achieves an accuracy of over $80\%$ for known UAV types and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of $0.7$ for unknown types when trained with all five clients. Further analyses explore the impact of varying the number of clients and the presence of unknown UAVs, reinforcing the practical applicability and effectiveness of our proposed framework in real-world FL scenarios.</description>

      <title>Audio-JEPA: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Audio Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data. Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gate-Aware Mamba Networks for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging by matching signal evolutions to a predefined dictionary. However, conventional dictionary matching suffers from exponential growth in computational cost and memory usage as the number of parameters increases, limiting its scalability to multi-parametric mapping. To address this, recent work has explored deep learning-based approaches as alternatives to DM. We propose GAST-Mamba, an end-to-end framework that combines a dual Mamba-based encoder with a Gate-Aware Spatial-Temporal (GAST) processor. Built on structured state-space models, our architecture efficiently captures long-range spatial dependencies with linear complexity. On 5 times accelerated simulated MRF data (200 frames), GAST-Mamba achieved a T1 PSNR of 33.12~dB, outperforming SCQ (31.69~dB). For T2 mapping, it reached a PSNR of 30.62~dB and SSIM of 0.9124. In vivo experiments further demonstrated improved anatomical detail and reduced artifacts. Ablation studies confirmed that each component contributes to performance, with the GAST module being particularly important under strong undersampling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of GAST-Mamba for accurate and robust reconstruction from highly undersampled MRF acquisitions, offering a scalable alternative to traditional DM-based methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of an Uncertainty-Aware Late Fusion Algorithm for Multi-Source Bird's Eye View Detections Under Controlled Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable multi-source fusion is crucial for robust perception in autonomous systems. However, evaluating fusion performance independently of detection errors remains challenging. This work introduces a systematic evaluation framework that injects controlled noise into ground-truth bounding boxes to isolate the fusion process. We then propose Unified Kalman Fusion (UniKF), a late-fusion algorithm based on Kalman filtering to merge Bird's Eye View (BEV) detections while handling synchronization issues. Experiments show that UniKF outperforms baseline methods across various noise levels, achieving up to 3x lower object's positioning and orientation errors and 2x lower dimension estimation errors, while maintaining nearperfect precision and recall between 99.5% and 100%.</description>

      <title>AoI-Energy-Spectrum Optimization in Post-Disaster Powered Communication Intelligent Network via Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper designs a post-disaster powered communication intelligent network (PDPCIN) to address communication disruptions caused by ground base station (GBS) failures within the post-disaster area. PDPCIN employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide wireless data collection (WDC) and wireless energy transmission (WET) for affected areas and leverages low earth orbit satellites (LEO SATs) to relay UAV data to the nearest survival GBS. To ensure basic post-disaster communication while co-optimizing age of information (AoI), energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency, intelligent synchronization-UAV (IS-UAV) architecture, AoI-based four thresholds updating (AFTU) mechanism, and Dynamic multi-LEO access (DMLA) strategy are proposed. However, three key challenges remain: time-varying task-resource imbalances, complex topology caused by multi-device scheduling, and nonlinear coupling in multidimensional metric optimization, making system optimization NP-hard. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural networks (HHGNN) framework. It models heterogeneous device nodes and their communication relations as a hierarchical heterogeneous graph structure, integrating our defined graph sensing, exchange, and mask layer to handle the network's input, feature propagation, and output. To search appropriate number of single-LEO SATs, we propose single-LEO SAT density optimization (S-LSDO) algorithm. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art benchmarks to validate its superior collaborative optimization of AoI, energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency. Based on this, we derive the expressions for the expected values of AoI and stagnant AoI proportion.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Game-Theory and Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Tourist Arrivals via Big Data Analytics and Opinion Leader Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations (pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China (post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna-Enhanced Physical-Layer Service Integration: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03449v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have drawn increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability to create favorable channel conditions via local movement within a confined region. In this letter, we investigate its application in physical-layer service integration (PHY-SI), where a multi-MA base station (BS) simultaneously transmits both confidential and multicast messages to two users. The multicast message is intended for both users, while the confidential message is intended only for one user and must remain perfectly secure from the other. Our goal is to jointly optimize the secrecy and multicast beamforming, as well as the MAs' positions at the BS to maximize the secrecy rate for one user while satisfying the multicast rate requirement for both users. To gain insights, we first conduct performance analysis of this MA-enhanced PHY-SI system in two special cases, revealing its unique characteristics compared to conventional PHY-SI with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). To address the secrecy rate maximization problem, we propose a two-layer optimization framework that integrates the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a discrete sampling algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that MAs can greatly enhance the achievable secrecy rate region for PHY-SI compared to FPAs.</description>

      <title>Learning Variable Node Selection for Improved Multi-Round Belief Propagation Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error correction at short blocklengths remains a challenge for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, as belief propagation (BP) decoding is suboptimal compared to maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD). While BP rarely makes errors, it often fails to converge due to a small number of problematic, erroneous variable nodes (VNs). Multi-round BP (MRBP) decoding improves performance by identifying and perturbing these VNs, enabling BP to succeed in subsequent decoding attempts. However, existing heuristic approaches for VN identification may require a large number of decoding rounds to approach ML performance. In this work, we draw a connection between identifying candidate VNs to perturb in MRBP and estimating channel output errors, a problem previously addressed by syndrome-based neural decoders (SBND). Leveraging this insight, we propose an SBND-inspired neural network architecture that learns to predict which VNs MRBP needs to focus on. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning approach outperforms expert rules from the literature, requiring fewer MRBP decoding attempts to reach near-MLD performance. This makes it a promising lead for improving the decoding of short LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Codebook-Based 3D Spherical Channel Estimation for UCA XL-MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple input multiple output (XL-MIMO), a key technology for 6G communications, faces challenges in near-field channel estimation due to spherical wavefronts and the need for three-dimensional (3D) spatial characterization, particularly with uniform circular arrays (UCAs). This letter proposes a spherical-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (S-SOMP) based scheme tailored for near-field 3D channel estimation in UCA-equipped XL-MIMO systems. We establish a sparse channel representation based on the near-field spherical wave model. Then, a novel spherical-domain transform matrix codebook is designed via joint discrete sampling of distance, azimuth, and elevation parameters, leveraging analytical approximations to ensure low correlation between steering vectors. This structured codebook enables accurate sparse signal recovery using the S-SOMP algorithm for efficient joint estimation of channel path gains, spatial angles, and distances. Simulation results demonstrate significant channel estimation accuracy improvements compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>You May Use the Same Channel Knowledge Map for Environment-Aware NLoS Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the key usage scenarios for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) provides an efficient framework to achieve simultaneous wireless sensing and communication. However, traditional wireless sensing techniques mainly rely on the line-of-sight (LoS) assumptions, i.e., the sensing targets are directly visible to both the sensing transmitter and receiver. This hinders ISAC systems to be applied in complex environments such as the urban low-altitude airspace, which usually suffers from signal blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) multi-path propagation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable environment-aware NLoS ISAC by leveraging the new technique called channel knowledge map (CKM), which was originally proposed for environment-aware wireless communications. One major novelty of our proposed method is that the same CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS wireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one stone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment (UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the sensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We illustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \emph{channel angle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to derive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship between communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing target localization in the challenging NLoS environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over classic geometry-based sensing methods, which is further validated by Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Distribution of Age of Information in Time-varying Updating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) is a crucial metric for quantifying information freshness in real-time systems where the sampling rate of data packets is time-varying. Evaluating AoI under such conditions is challenging, as system states become temporally correlated and traditional stationary analysis is inapplicable. We investigate an $M_{t}/G/1/1$ queueing system with a time-varying sampling rate and probabilistic preemption, proposing a novel analytical framework based on multi-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) to capture the time evolution of the system's status distribution. To solve the PDEs, we develop a decomposition technique that breaks the high-dimensional PDE into lower-dimensional subsystems. Solving these subsystems allows us to derive the Aol distribution at arbitrary time instances. We show AoI does not exhibit a memoryless property, even with negligible processing times, due to its dependence on the historical sampling process. Our framework extends to the stationary setting, where we derive a closed-form expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the steady-state AoI. Numerical experiments reveal AoI exhibits a non-trivial lag in response to sampling rate changes. Our results also show that no single preemption probability or processing time distribution can minimize Aol violation probability across all thresholds in either time-varying or stationary scenarios. Finally, we formulate an optimization problem and propose a heuristic method to find sampling rates that reduce costs while satisfying AoI constraints.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an access point-user (AP-UE) association strategy combined with pilot power allocation to mitigate multiuser interference and enhance spectral efficiency (SE) in clustered cell-free massive MIMO (CCF-mMIMO) networks. We propose a dynamic channel-based clustering method that groups APs according to their channel correlation, ensuring users are associated with APs exhibiting similar channel characteristics. The proposed approach exploits hierarchical clustering, enabling flexible cluster sizing to improve interference management and overall SE. Moreover, we present a power control (PC) technique that is based on a weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) algorithm to ensure consistent service quality across users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior SE and robust performance in high-density multi-user environments as compared to competing approaches.</description>

      <title>RateCount: Learning-Free Device Counting by Wi-Fi Probe Listening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Wi-Fi-enabled device, or simply Wi-Fi device, sporadically broadcasts probe request frames (PRFs) to discover nearby access points (APs), whether connected to an AP or not. To protect user privacy, unconnected devices often randomize their MAC addresses in the PRFs, known as MAC address randomization. While prior works have achieved accurate device counting under MAC address randomization, they typically rely on machine learning, resulting in inefficient deployment due to the time-consuming processes of data cleaning, model training, and hyperparameter tuning. To enhance deployment efficiency, we propose RateCount, an accurate, lightweight, and learning-free counting approach based on the rate at which APs receive PRFs within a window. RateCount employs a provably unbiased closed-form expression to estimate the device count time-averaged over the window and an error model to compute the lower bound of the estimation variance. We also demonstrate how to extend RateCount to people counting by incorporating a device-to-person calibration scheme. Through extensive real-world experiments conducted at multiple sites spanning a wide range of counts, we show that RateCount, without any deployment costs for machine learning, achieves comparable counting accuracy with the state-of-the-art learning-based device counting and improves previous people counting schemes by a large margin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for multi-dielectric waveguide-assisted broadcast systems, where each waveguide employs multiple pinching antennas (PAs), aiming to maximize the minimum achievable rate among multiple users. To capture realistic propagation effects, we propose a novel generalized frequency-dependent power attenuation model for dielectric waveguides PA system. We jointly optimize waveguide beamforming, PA power allocation, and antenna positions via a block coordinate descent scheme that capitalizes on majorization minimization and penalty methods, circumventing the inherent non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem and obtaining a computationally efficient sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework substantially outperforms both conventional antenna systems and single-PA-per-waveguide configurations, clearly illustrating the intricate trade-offs between waveguide propagation loss, path loss, and resource allocation among multiple PAs.</description>

      <title>FollowSpot: Enhancing Wireless Communications via Movable Ceiling-Mounted Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal placement of ceiling-mounted metasurfaces (MTSs) to help focus the wireless signal beam onto the target receiver, as inspired by the theatre spotlight. We assume that a total of $M$ MTSs are deployed, and that there are $L$ possible positions for each MTS. The resulting signal-to-noise (SNR) maximization problem is difficult to tackle directly because of the coupling between the placement decisions of the different MTSs. Mathematically, we are faced with a nonlinear discrete optimization problem with $L^M$ possible solutions. A remarkable result shown in this paper is that the above challenging problem can be efficiently solved within $O(ML^2\log(ML))$ time. There are two key steps in developing the proposed algorithm. First, we successfully decouple the placement variables of different MTSs by introducing a continuous auxiliary variable $\mu$; the discrete primal variables are now easy to optimize when $\mu$ is held fixed, but the optimization problem of $\mu$ is nonconvex. Second, we show that the optimization of continuous $\mu$ can be recast into a discrete optimization problem with only $LM$ possible solutions, so the optimal $\mu$ can now be readily obtained. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can not only guarantee a global optimum but also reach the optimal solution efficiently.</description>

      <title>Ambisonics Encoder for Wearable Array with Improved Binaural Reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambisonics Signal Matching (ASM) is a recently proposed signal-independent approach to encoding Ambisonic signal from wearable microphone arrays, enabling efficient and standardized spatial sound reproduction. However, reproduction accuracy is currently limited due to the non-ideal layout of the microphones. This research introduces an enhanced ASM encoder that reformulates the loss function by integrating a Binaural Signal Matching (BSM) term into the optimization framework. The aim of this reformulation is to improve the accuracy of binaural reproduction when integrating the Ambisonic signal with Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), making the encoded Ambisonic signal better suited for binaural reproduction. This paper first presents the mathematical formulation developed to align the ASM and BSM objectives in a single loss function, followed by a simulation study with a simulated microphone array mounted on a rigid sphere representing a head-mounted wearable array. The analysis shows that improved binaural reproduction with the encoded Ambisonic signal can be achieved using this joint ASM-BSM optimization, thereby enabling higher-quality binaural playback for virtual and augmented reality applications based on Ambisonics.</description>

      <title>Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding for Tensor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing, which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper, we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deeply evaluates and analyzes several mainstream algorithms that can arbitrarily modify the duration of any portion of a given speech signal without changing the essential properties (e.g., pitch contour, power spectrum, etc.) of the original signal. Arbitrary modification in this context means that the duration of any region of the signal can be changed by specifying the starting and ending time for modification or the target duration of the specified interval, which can be either a fixed value of duration in the time domain or a scaling factor of the original duration. In addition, arbitrary modification also indicates any number of intervals can be modified at the same time.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning using Revealed Preferences and Passive Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer (i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic gradient algorithm is in operation.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic data provide scientific and engineering insights in fields ranging from bioacoustics and communications to ocean and earth sciences. In this review, we survey recent advances and the transformative potential of machine learning (ML) in acoustics, including deep learning (DL). Using the Python high-level programming language, we demonstrate a broad collection of ML techniques to detect and find patterns for classification, regression, and generation in acoustics data automatically. We have ML examples including acoustic data classification, generative modeling for spatial audio, and physics-informed neural networks.

      <title>Spatial and Semantic Embedding Integration for Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection in Regular Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents our systems submitted to the audio-only and audio-visual tracks of the DCASE2025 Task 3 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore architectural variants to further enhance results.</description>

      <title>Fast and Scalable Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Downlink Multi-group Multicasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers downlink multi-group multicasting via beamforming facilitated by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We develop a fast and scalable algorithm for the joint base station (BS) and RIS beamforming optimization to minimize the transmit power while meeting user quality-of-service (QoS) targets. By analyzing the structure of the QoS constraints, we reformulate the problem and show that the joint beamforming optimization inherently consists of a multicast beamforming QoS problem for the BS and a passive multicast beamforming max-min-fair (MMF) problem for the RIS. We propose a fast alternating multicast beamforming (AMBF) algorithm to effectively solve the two subproblems alternatingly. For the BS multicast subproblem, we utilize the optimal multicast beamforming structure to efficiently determine the BS beamformers. For the RIS multicast subproblem, we reformulate the MMF problem and apply a first-order projected subgradient algorithm (PSA), which yields simple closed-form updates. The computational complexity of the AMBF algorithm grows linearly with the number of RIS elements and BS antennas. We further consider joint BS and RIS beamforming for the weighted MMF design objective, subject to the BS transmit power budget. We propose an alternating PSA (APSA) fast algorithm to compute the beamforming solutions for the BS and RIS. APSA consists of only closed-form updates per iteration, yielding linear computational complexity in the number of RIS elements and BS antennas. Simulation results show the efficacy of our proposed algorithms in terms of performance and computational cost compared to alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV) is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the spatio-spectral piecewise smoothness. However, since SSTV refers only to the local differences of pixels/bands, edges and textures that extend beyond adjacent pixels are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly introduce S3TTV, which is designed to preserve two essential physical characteristics of HS images: semi-local spatial structures and spectral correlation across all bands. Specifically, we define S3TTV as the sum of the nuclear norms of spatio-spectral structure tensors, which are matrices formed by arranging second-order spatio-spectral difference vectors within semi-local areas. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a constrained convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Mobility Management for High-Speed Railway Communications: Compressed Measurements and Proactive Handover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-speed railway (HSR) communications are pivotal for ensuring rail safety, operations, maintenance, and delivering passenger information services. The high speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases the signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult to meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article, we explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level mobility management suitable for HSR communications. Particularly, we propose a compressed spatial multi-beam measurements scheme via compressive sensing for beam-level mobility management in HSR communications. In comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam measurements, this method leads to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction accuracy with the same measurement overhead. Moreover, we propose a novel AI-based proactive handover scheme to predict handover events and reduce radio link failure (RLF) rates in HSR communications. Compared with the traditional event A3-based handover mechanism, the proposed approach significantly reduces the RLF rates which saves 50% beam measurement overhead.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, achieving near-human levels in multiple language understanding challenges and aligning closely with the core principles of semantic communication. Inspired by LLMs' advancements in semantic processing, we propose an innovative LLM-enabled semantic communication system framework, named LLM-SC, that applies LLMs directly to the physical layer coding and decoding for the first time. By analyzing the relationship between the training process of LLMs and the optimization objectives of semantic communication, we propose training a semantic encoder through LLMs' tokenizer training and establishing a semantic knowledge base via the LLMs' unsupervised pre-training process. This knowledge base aids in constructing the optimal decoder by providing the prior probability of the transmitted language sequence. Based on this foundation, we derive the optimal decoding criterion for the receiver and introduce the beam search algorithm to further reduce the complexity. Furthermore, we assert that existing LLMs can be employed directly for LLM-SC without additional re-training or fine-tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-SC outperforms classical DeepSC at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) exceeding 3 dB, enabling error-free transmission of semantic information under high SNR, which is unattainable by DeepSC. In addition to semantic-level performance, LLM-SC demonstrates compatibility with technical-level performance, achieving approximately 8 dB coding gain for a bit error ratio (BER) of $10^{-3}$ without any channel coding while maintaining the same joint source-channel coding rate as traditional communication systems.</description>

Abstract: As a fundamental technique in array signal processing, beamforming plays a crucial role in amplifying signals of interest (SoI) while mitigating interference plus noise (IPN). When uncertainties exist in the signal model or the data size of snapshots is limited, the performance of beamformers significantly degrades. In this article, we comprehensively study the conceptual system, theoretical analysis, and algorithmic design for robust beamforming against uncertainties in the assumed snapshot or IPN covariances. Since such robustness is specific to the probabilistic uncertainties of snapshots or IPN signals, it is referred to as distributional robustness. Particularly, four technical approaches for distributionally robust beamforming are proposed, including locally distributionally robust beamforming, globally distributionally robust beamforming, regularized beamforming, and Bayesian-nonparametric beamforming. In addition, we investigate the equivalence among the four technical approaches and suggest a unified distributionally robust beamforming framework. Moreover, we show that the resolution of power spectra estimation using distributionally robust beamforming can be greatly refined by incorporating the characteristics of subspace methods, and hence, the accuracy of IPN covariance reconstruction can be improved, especially when the interferers are close to the SoI. As a result, the robustness of beamformers based on IPN covariance estimation can be further enhanced.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Parameter Learning in Linear Inverse Problems: Application in EEG Focal Source Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems can be described as limited-data problems in which the signal of interest cannot be observed directly. A physics-based forward model that relates the signal with the observations is typically needed. Unfortunately, unknown model parameters and imperfect forward models can undermine the signal recovery. Even though supervised machine learning offers promising avenues to improve the robustness of the solutions, we have to rely on model-based learning when there is no access to ground truth for the training. Here, we studied a linear inverse problem that included an unknown non-linear model parameter and utilized a Bayesian model-based learning approach that allowed signal recovery and subsequently estimation of the model parameter. This approach, called Bayesian Approximation Error approach, employed a simplified model of the physics of the problem augmented with an approximation error term that compensated for the simplification. An error subspace was spanned with the help of the eigenvectors of the approximation error covariance matrix which allowed, alongside the primary signal, simultaneous estimation of the induced error. The estimated error and signal were then used to determine the unknown model parameter. For the model parameter estimation, we tested different approaches: a conditional Gaussian regression, an iterative (model-based) optimization, and a Gaussian process that was modeled with the help of physics-informed learning. In addition, alternating optimization was used as a reference method. As an example application, we focused on the problem of reconstructing brain activity from EEG recordings under the condition that the electrical conductivity of the patient's skull was unknown in the model. Our results demonstrated clear improvements in EEG source localization accuracy and provided feasible estimates for the unknown model parameter, skull conductivity.</description>

      <title>AFDM-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Theoretical Framework and Pilot Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned as one representative usage scenario of sixth-generation (6G) network. However, the unprecedented characteristics of 6G, especially the doubly dispersive channel, make classical ISAC waveforms rather challenging to guarantee a desirable performance level. The recently proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) can attain full diversity even under doubly dispersive effects, thus becoming a competitive candidate for next-generation ISAC waveforms. Relevant investigations are still at an early stage, which involve only straightforward design lacking explicit theoretical analysis. This paper provides an in-depth investigation on AFDM waveform design for ISAC applications. Specifically, the closed-form Cr\'{a}mer-Rao bounds of target detection for AFDM are derived, followed by a demonstration on its merits over existing counterparts. Furthermore, we formulate the ambiguity function of the pilot-assisted AFDM waveform for the first time, revealing conditions for stable sensing performance. To further enhance both the communication and sensing performance of the AFDM waveform, we propose a novel pilot design by exploiting the characteristics of AFDM signals. The proposed design is analytically validated to be capable of optimizing the ambiguity function property and channel estimation accuracy simultaneously as well as overcoming the sensing and channel estimation range limitation originated from the pilot spacing. Numerical results have verified the superiority of the proposed pilot design in terms of dual-functional performance.</description>

      <title>On Performance of LoRa Fluid Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper advocates a fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted long-range communication (LoRa-FAS) for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. \textcolor{blue}{In the proposed system, FAS provides spatial diversity gains for LoRa, eliminating the necessity for integrating multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies into the system. It consists of a traditional LoRa transmitter with a fixed-position antenna and a LoRa receiver employing the FAS (Rx-FAS). The pilot sequence overhead and placement for FAS are also considered. Specifically, we consider embedding pilot sequences within symbols to reduce the impact of pilot overhead on system throughput and the physical layer (PHY) frame structure, leveraging the fact that the pilot sequences do not convey source information and correlation detection at the LoRa receiver needs not be performed across the entire symbol. The achievable performance of LoRa-FAS is thoroughly analyzed under both coherent and non-coherent detection schemes.} We obtain new closed-form approximations for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the FAS channel under the block-correlation model. Furthermore, the approximate SER, equivalently the bit error rate (BER), of the proposed LoRa-FAS is also derived in closed form. Simulation results indicate that substantial SER gains can be achieved by FAS within the LoRa framework, even with a limited size of FAS. In addition, our analytical results align well with Clarke's exact spatial correlation model. Finally, when utilizing the block-correlation model, we suggest that the correlation factor should be selected as the proportion of the eigenvalues of the exact correlation matrix greater than 1 for higher accuracy.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, attention mechanisms have become indispensable in electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis, significantly enhancing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology. This review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers seeking to leverage attention mechanisms for improved EEG interpretation and application.</description>

      <title>Liquid Lens-Based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a tunable liquid convex lens-assisted imaging receiver for indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. In contrast to existing MIMO VLC receivers that rely on fixed optical lenses, the proposed receiver leverages the additional degrees of freedom offered by liquid lenses via adjusting both focal length and orientation angles of the lens. This capability facilitates the mitigation of spatial correlation between the channel gains, thereby enhancing the overall signal quality and leading to improved bit-error rate (BER) performance. We present an accurate channel model for the liquid lens-assisted VLC system by using three-dimensional geometry and geometric optics. To achieve optimal performance under practical conditions such as random receiver orientation and user mobility, optimization of both focal length and orientation angles of the lens are required. To this end, driven by the fact that channel models are mathematically complex, we present two optimization schemes including a blockwise machine learning (ML) architecture that includes convolution layers to extract spatial features from the received signal, long-short term memory layers to predict the user position and orientation, and fully connected layers to estimate the optimal lens parameters. Numerical results are presented to compare the performance of each scheme with conventional receivers. Results show that a significant BER improvement is achieved when liquid lenses and presented ML-based optimization approaches are used. Specifically, the BER can be improved from $6\times 10^{-2}$ to $1.4\times 10^{-3}$ at an average signal-to-noise ratio of $30$ dB.</description>

      <title>A Data-centric Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections.
  In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

      <title>A Statistical Approach for Synthetic EEG Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is crucial for diagnosing mental health conditions but is costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to augment datasets for machine learning applications. However, generating high-quality synthetic EEG that preserves emotional and mental health signals remains challenging. This study proposes a method combining correlation analysis and random sampling to generate realistic synthetic EEG data.
  We first analyze interdependencies between EEG frequency bands using correlation analysis. Guided by this structure, we generate synthetic samples via random sampling. Samples with high correlation to real data are retained and evaluated through distribution analysis and classification tasks. A Random Forest model trained to distinguish synthetic from real EEG performs at chance level, indicating high fidelity.
  The generated synthetic data closely match the statistical and structural properties of the original EEG, with similar correlation coefficients and no significant differences in PERMANOVA tests. This method provides a scalable, privacy-preserving approach for augmenting EEG datasets, enabling more efficient model training in mental health research.</description>

      <title>Frequency and Bandwidth Design of FR3-Band Lithium Niobate Acoustic Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents an approach to control the operating frequency and fractional bandwidth (FBW) of miniature acoustic filters in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). More specifically, we used first-order antisymmetric (A1) mode lateral-field-excited bulk acoustic wave resonators (XBARs) to achieve efficient operation at 20.5 GHz. Our technique leverages the thickness-dependent resonance frequency of A1 XBARs, combined with the in-plane anisotropic properties of 128$^\circ$ Y-cut TFLN, to customize filter characteristics. The implemented three-element ladder filter prototype achieves an insertion loss (IL) of only 1.79 dB and a controlled 3-dB FBW of 8.58% at 20.5 GHz, with an out-of-band (OoB) rejection greater than 14.9 dB across the entire FR3 band, while featuring a compact footprint of 0.90 $\times$ 0.74 mm$^2$. Moreover, an eight-element filter prototype shows an IL of 3.80 dB, an FBW of 6.12% at 22.0 GHz, and a high OoB rejection of 22.97 dB, demonstrating the potential for expanding to higher-order filters. As frequency allocation requirements become more stringent in future FR3 bands, our technique showcases promising capability in enabling compact and monolithic filter banks toward next-generation acoustic filters for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Message Passing for Track-Before-Detect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately tracking an unknown and time-varying number of objects in complex environments is a significant challenge but a fundamental capability in a variety of applications, including applied ocean sciences, surveillance, autonomous driving, and wireless communications. Conventional Bayesian multiobject tracking (MOT) methods typically employ a detect-then-track (DTT) approach, where a frontend detector preprocesses raw sensor data to extract measurements for MOT. The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can discard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability to resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD) paradigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data. However, existing TBD approaches introduce simplifications to facilitate the development of inference methods, such as assuming known signal amplitudes or conditional independence between sensor measurements given object states. These assumptions can lead to suboptimal performance and limit the applicability of the resulting TBD methods in realistic scenarios.
  This paper introduces a novel TBD method that is based on a comprehensive signal model for sensor data. The new model accounts for sensor data correlations and amplitude fluctuations, enabling the accurate representation of the physics of the data-generating process in TBD. The proposed model is suitable for a wide range of problems in active and passive radar, active and passive sonar, as well as integrated sensing and communication systems. Based on a factor graph representation of the new measurement model, a scalable belief propagation (BP) method is developed to perform efficient Bayesian inference. Experimental results, performed with both synthetic and real data, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art conventional MOT methods.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Visual Image Based User Association and Beamforming Using Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach that leverages multimodal data by integrating visual images with radio frequency (RF) pilots to optimize user association and beamforming in a downlink wireless cellular network under a max-min fairness criterion. Traditional methods typically optimize wireless system parameters based on channel state information (CSI). However, obtaining accurate CSI requires extensive pilot transmissions, which lead to increased overhead and latency. Moreover, the optimization of user association and beamforming is a discrete and non-convex optimization problem, which is challenging to solve analytically. In this paper, we propose to incorporate visual camera data in addition to the RF pilots to perform the joint optimization of user association and beamforming. The visual image data helps enhance channel awareness, thereby reducing the dependency on extensive pilot transmissions for system optimization. We employ a learning-based approach based on using first a detection neural network that estimates user locations from images, and subsequently two graph neural networks (GNNs) that extract features for system optimization based on the location information and the received pilots, respectively. Then, a multimodal GNN is constructed to integrate the features for the joint optimization user association and beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance, while having low computational complexity and being interpretable and generalizable, making it an effective solution as compared to traditional methods based only on RF pilots.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Frequency Domain Equalization of Zak-OTFS in Doubly-Spread Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We communicate over wireless channels by first estimating and then equalizing the effective channel. In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. This makes DD domain channel estimation straightforward, and there is no loss in spectral efficiency since it is possible to design data and pilot signals that are mutually unbiased. However, equalization in the DD domain has high complexity ${\mathcal O}(M^3N^3)$ where $M$, $N$ are respectively the number of delay and Doppler bins in an OTFS frame, and $MN$ is the number of information symbols.
  We demonstrate that equalization in the frequency domain (FD) reduces complexity to only ${\mathcal O}(M^2 N^2)$ by taking advantage of the banded structure of the effective FD channel. We also derive a low-complexity method to reconstruct the effective FD channel from the estimated DD domain effective channel.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna-Assisted Index Modulation: Channel Modeling, Transceiver Design, and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM) scheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the hardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the conventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by the indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full potential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver design, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and performance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel model is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the deterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of wireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading. Next, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is designed, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML performance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) is derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding method is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by jointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the waveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all received signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its conventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna system is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>QuTE: decentralized multiple testing on sensor networks with false discovery rate control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper designs methods for decentralized multiple hypothesis testing on graphs that are equipped with provable guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). We consider the setting where distinct agents reside on the nodes of an undirected graph, and each agent possesses p-values corresponding to one or more hypotheses local to its node. Each agent must individually decide whether to reject one or more of its local hypotheses by only communicating with its neighbors, with the joint aim that the global FDR over the entire graph must be controlled at a predefined level. We propose a simple decentralized family of Query-Test-Exchange (QuTE) algorithms and prove that they can control FDR under independence or positive dependence of the p-values. Our algorithm reduces to the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) algorithm when after graph-diameter rounds of communication, and to the Bonferroni procedure when no communication has occurred or the graph is empty. To avoid communicating real-valued p-values, we develop a quantized BH procedure, and extend it to a quantized QuTE procedure. QuTE works seamlessly in streaming data settings, where anytime-valid p-values may be continually updated at each node. Last, QuTE is robust to arbitrary dropping of packets, or a graph that changes at every step, making it particularly suitable to mobile sensor networks involving drones or other multi-agent systems. We study the power of our procedure using a simulation suite of different levels of connectivity and communication on a variety of graph structures, and also provide an illustrative real-world example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) is the process of identifying the attended speech in a multi-talker environment using brain signals, typically recorded through electroencephalography (EEG). Over the past decade, AAD has undergone continuous development, driven by its promising application in neuro-steered hearing devices. Most AAD algorithms are relying on the increase in neural entrainment to the envelope of attended speech, as compared to unattended speech, typically using a two-step approach. First, the algorithm predicts representations of the attended speech signal envelopes; second, it identifies the attended speech by finding the highest correlation between the predictions and the representations of the actual speech signals. In this study, we proposed a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, named AADNet, which combines these two stages into a direct approach to address the AAD problem. We compare the proposed network against the traditional approaches, including linear stimulus reconstruction, canonical correlation analysis, and an alternative non-linear stimulus reconstruction using two different datasets. AADNet shows a significant performance improvement for both subject-specific and subject-independent models. Notably, the average subject-independent classification accuracies from 56.1 % to 82.7 % with analysis window lengths ranging from 1 to 40 seconds, respectively, show a significantly improved ability to generalize to data from unseen subjects. These results highlight the potential of deep learning models for advancing AAD, with promising implications for future hearing aids, assistive devices, and clinical assessments.</description>

      <title>Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of bundle adjustment (i.e., simultaneous refinement of camera poses and scene map) for a purely rotating event camera. Starting from first principles, we formulate the problem as a classical non-linear least squares optimization. The photometric error is defined using the event generation model directly in the camera rotations and the semi-dense scene brightness that triggers the events. We leverage the sparsity of event data to design a tractable Levenberg-Marquardt solver that handles the very large number of variables involved. To the best of our knowledge, our method, which we call Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment (EPBA), is the first event-only photometric bundle adjustment method that works on the brightness map directly and exploits the space-time characteristics of event data, without having to convert events into image-like representations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EPBA's effectiveness in decreasing the photometric error (by up to 90%), yielding results of unparalleled quality. The refined maps reveal details that were hidden using prior state-of-the-art rotation-only estimation methods. The experiments on modern high-resolution event cameras show the applicability of EPBA to panoramic imaging in various scenarios (without map initialization, at multiple resolutions, and in combination with other methods, such as IMU dead reckoning or previous event-based rotation estimation methods). We make the source code publicly available. https://github.com/tub-rip/epba</description>

      <title>Open-Set Gait Recognition from Sparse mmWave Radar Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods adapted for point clouds, on average, and across multiple openness levels.</description>

      <title>Mirror Online Conformal Prediction with Intermittent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10345v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, operates under potentially intermittent feedback, and features minimal memory complexity. IM-OCP guarantees long-term coverage and sub-linear regret, both of which hold deterministically for any given data sequence and in expectation with respect to the intermittent feedback.</description>

      <title>Decision Feedback In-Context Learning for Wireless Symbol Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Transformers, through in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to adapt to new tasks using example prompts without model update. Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high detection accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose DEcision Feedback IN-ContExt Detection (DEFINED) as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts as pseudo-labels to improve the detection for subsequent symbols. We further establish an error lower bound and provide theoretical insights into the model's generalization under channel distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless settings demonstrate that a small Transformer trained with DEFINED achieves significant performance improvements over conventional methods, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair to achieve similar performance to the latter with more than 4 pilot pairs.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Detection of Permutational Index Modulation for Noncoherent Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a massive SIMO scheme for wireless communications with one-shot noncoherent detection. It is based on permutational index modulation over OFDM. Its core principle is to convey information on the ordering in which a fixed collection of values is mapped onto a set of OFDM subcarriers. A spherical code is obtained which provides improved robustness against channel impairments. A simple detector based on the sorting of quadratic metrics of data is proposed. By exploiting statistical channel state information and hardening, it reaches near-ML error performance with a low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>Satellite-Assisted Low-Altitude Economy Networking: Concepts, Applications, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is a new economic paradigm that leverages low-altitude vehicles (LAVs) to perform diverse missions across diverse areas. To support the operations of LAE, it is essential to establish LAE networks that enable LAV management and communications.Existing studies mainly reuse terrestrial networks to construct LAE networks. However, the limited coverage of terrestrial networks poses challenges for serving LAVs in remote areas. Besides, efficient LAV operations also require support such as localization and navigation, which terrestrial networks designed for communications cannot fully provide. Due to ubiquitous coverage and diverse functions, satellites are a promising technology to support LAVs. Therefore, this article investigates satellite-assisted LAE networking. First, we introduce an overview of LAE and satellites, discussing their features, applications, and architectures. Next, we investigate opportunities for satellites to assist LAE from aspects of communication, control, and computation. As all assistance depends on reliable satellite-LAV communications, we propose a satellite-assisted LAE framework to tackle issues caused by the severe path loss and high dynamics in satellite-assisted LAE networks.The case study demonstrates that the distributed MIMO architecture efficiently reduces the required transmission power and extends service duration, while the two-timescale optimization scheme balances the performance and control signaling overheads. Specifically, the proposed framework comprises distributed satellite MIMO, distributed LAV MIMO, and a two-timescale optimization scheme.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multiobject Tracking With Neural-Enhanced Motion and Measurement Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so, the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved. To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance</description>
