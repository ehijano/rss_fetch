      <title>Mapping climate change awareness through spatial hierarchical clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is a critical issue that will be in the political agenda for the next decades. While it is important for this topic to be discussed at higher levels, it is also of paramount importance that the populations became aware of the problem. As different countries may face more or less severe repercussions, it is also useful to understand the degree of awareness of specific populations. In this paper, we present a geographically-informed hierarchical clustering analysis aimed at identify groups of countries with a similar level of climate change awareness. We employ a Ward-like clustering algorithm that combines information pertaining climate change awareness, socio-economic factors, climate-related characteristics of different countries, and the physical distances between countries. To choose suitable values for the clustering hyperparameters, we propose a customized algorithm that takes into account the within-clusters homogeneity, the between-clusters separation and that explicitly compares the geographically-informed and non-geographical partitioning. The results show that the geographically-informed clustering provides more stability of the partitions and leads to interpretable and geographically-compact aggregations compared to a clustering in which the geographical component is absent. In particular, we identify a clear contrast among Western countries, characterized by high and compact awareness, and Asian, African, and Middle Eastern countries having greater variability but still lower awareness.</description>

      <title>Elastic Shape Analysis of Movement Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease, with the knee being the most commonly affected joint. Modern studies of knee joint injury and OA often measure biomechanical variables, particularly forces exerted during walking. However, the relationship among gait patterns, clinical profiles, and OA disease remains poorly understood. These biomechanical forces are typically represented as curves over time, but until recently, studies have relied on discrete values (or landmarks) to summarize these curves. This work aims to demonstrate the added value of analyzing full movement curves over conventional discrete summaries. Using data from the Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) study (Messier et al., 2009, 2013), we developed a shape-based representation of variation in the full biomechanical curves. Compared to conventional discrete summaries, our approach yields more powerful predictors of disease progression and relevant clinical traits, as demonstrated by a nested model comparison. Notably, our work is among the first to use movement curves to predict disease progression and to quantitatively evaluate the added value of analyzing full movement curves over conventional discrete summaries</description>

      <title>Sentiment Informed Sentence BERT-Ensemble Algorithm for Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed approximately 280 million people in the world suffer from depression. Yet, existing studies on early-stage depression detection using machine learning (ML) techniques are limited. Prior studies have applied a single stand-alone algorithm, which is unable to deal with data complexities, prone to overfitting, and limited in generalization. To this end, our paper examined the performance of several ML algorithms for early-stage depression detection using two benchmark social media datasets (D1 and D2). More specifically, we incorporated sentiment indicators to improve our model performance. Our experimental results showed that sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (SBERT) numerical vectors fitted into the stacking ensemble model achieved comparable F1 scores of 69% in the dataset (D1) and 76% in the dataset (D2). Our findings suggest that utilizing sentiment indicators as an additional feature for depression detection yields an improved model performance, and thus, we recommend the development of a depressive term corpus for future work.</description>

      <title>Aircraft Conflict Detection and Avoidance through Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical problem of tracking a maneuvering aircraft during flight has always been a crucial task in order to safeguard airborne assets from unknown threats. Therefore, the need for an efficient target detection and identification technique is substantial and growing. The multiple model (MM) estimation have proven to be one of the most reliable and accurate among various filtering algorithms. In this paper we will implement the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimation technique for the aforementioned purpose of target identification. This target's motion, though defined by predefined dynamics, is obscured due to the noises from tracking sensors. The algorithm intends to predict the location of target and provide feedback maneuver to the reference aircraft in order to avoid a conflict.</description>

      <title>The space environment particle density in Low Earth Orbit based on two decades of in-situ observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently the only method to establish the prevalence of particles, space debris or meteoroids, sized between 1 micrometre and a few centimetres, in Earth orbit is by instruments or witness plates dedicated to in-situ detection. Derived usable datasets are remarkably scarce and generally only cover a short period of time and a single orbital region. Nonetheless, space environment models use those limited datasets as anchor points to extrapolate results to the entirety of Earth orbit, from the beginning of the space age to decades into the future. Here we present a readout of over 20 years of DEBris In orbit Evaluator 1 (DEBIE-1), an in-situ detector that was launched in October 2001, providing the longest continuous set of measurements available to date. The dataset has not been used in the generation of space environment models and hence provides a first independent source for the detection of environment changing events and for the calibration of long term evolution models.</description>

      <title>Jointly modeling time-to-event and longitudinal data with individual-specific change points: a case study in modeling tumor burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In oncology clinical trials, tumor burden (TB) stands as a crucial longitudinal biomarker, reflecting the toll a tumor takes on a patient's prognosis. With certain treatments, the disease's natural progression shows the tumor burden initially receding before rising once more. Biologically, the point of change may be different between individuals and must have occurred between the baseline measurement and progression time of the patient, implying a random effects model obeying a bound constraint. However, in practice, patients may drop out of the study due to progression or death, presenting a non-ignorable missing data problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel joint model that combines time-to-event data and longitudinal data, where the latter is parameterized by a random change point augmented by random pre-slope and post-slope dynamics. Importantly, the model is equipped to incorporate covariates across for the longitudinal and survival models, adding significant flexibility. Adopting a Bayesian approach, we propose an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for parameter inference. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to a longitudinal-only model via simulations and apply our method to a data set in oncology.</description>

      <title>Functional Factor Modeling of Brain Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fMRI analyses examine functional connectivity, or statistical dependencies among remote brain regions. Yet popular methods for studying whole-brain functional connectivity often yield results that are difficult to interpret. Factor analysis offers a natural framework in which to study such dependencies, particularly given its emphasis on interpretability. However, multivariate factor models break down when applied to functional and spatiotemporal data, like fMRI. We present a factor model for discretely-observed multidimensional functional data that is well-suited to the study of functional connectivity. Unlike classical factor models which decompose a multivariate observation into a "common" term that captures covariance between observed variables and an uncorrelated "idiosyncratic" term that captures variance unique to each observed variable, our model decomposes a functional observation into two uncorrelated components: a "global" term that captures long-range dependencies and a "local" term that captures short-range dependencies. We show that if the global covariance is smooth with finite rank and the local covariance is banded with potentially infinite rank, then this decomposition is identifiable. Under these conditions, recovery of the global covariance amounts to rank-constrained matrix completion, which we exploit to formulate consistent loading estimators. We study these estimators, and their more interpretable post-processed counterparts, through simulations, then use our approach to uncover a rich covariance structure in a collection of resting-state fMRI scans.</description>

      <title>Adaptive radar detection of subspace-based distributed target in power heterogeneous clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of adaptive detection of distributed targets in power heterogeneous clutter. In the considered scenario, all the data share the identical structure of clutter covariance matrix, but with varying and unknown power mismatches. To address this problem, we iteratively estimate all the unknowns, including the coordinate matrix of the target, the clutter covariance matrix, and the corresponding power mismatches, and propose three detectors based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), Rao and the Wald tests. The results from simulated and real data both illustrate that the detectors based on GLRT and Rao test have higher probabilities of detection (PDs) than the existing competitors. Among them, the Rao test-based detector exhibits the best overall detection performance. We also analyze the impact of the target extended dimensions, the signal subspace dimensions, and the number of training samples on the detection performance. Furthermore, simulation experiments also demonstrate that the proposed detectors have a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property for the structure of clutter covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Survey Data Integration for Distribution Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integration of probabilistic and non-probabilistic samples for the estimation of finite population totals (or means) has recently received considerable attention in the field of survey sampling; yet, to the best of our knowledge, this framework has not been extended to cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimation. To address this gap, we propose a novel CDF estimator that integrates data from probability samples with data from (potentially large) nonprobability samples. Assuming that a set of shared covariates are observed in both samples, while the response variable is observed only in the latter, the proposed estimator uses a survey-weighted empirical CDF of regression residuals trained on the convenience sample to estimate the CDF of the response variable. Under some regularity conditions, we show that our CDF estimator is both design-consistent for the finite population CDF and asymptotically normally distributed. Additionally, we define and study a quantile estimator based on the proposed CDF estimator. Furthermore, we use both the bootstrap and asymptotic formulae to estimate their respective sampling variances. Our empirical results show that the proposed CDF estimator is robust to model misspecification under ignorability, and robust to ignorability under model misspecification. When both assumptions are violated, our residual-based CDF estimator still outperforms its 'plug-in' mass imputation and naive siblings, albeit with noted decreases in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generative artificial intelligence usage by researchers at work: Effects of gender, career stage, type of workplace, and perceived barriers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence technology into research environments has become increasingly common in recent years, representing a significant shift in the way researchers approach their work. This paper seeks to explore the factors underlying the frequency of use of generative AI amongst researchers in their professional environments. As survey data may be influenced by a bias towards scientists interested in AI, potentially skewing the results towards the perspectives of these researchers, this study uses a regression model to isolate the impact of specific factors such as gender, career stage, type of workplace, and perceived barriers to using AI technology on the frequency of use of generative AI. It also controls for other relevant variables such as direct involvement in AI research or development, collaboration with AI companies, geographic location, and scientific discipline. Our results show that researchers who face barriers to AI adoption experience an 11% increase in tool use, while those who cite insufficient training resources experience an 8% decrease. Female researchers experience a 7% decrease in AI tool usage compared to men, while advanced career researchers experience a significant 19% decrease. Researchers associated with government advisory groups are 45% more likely to use AI tools frequently than those in government roles. Researchers in for-profit companies show an increase of 19%, while those in medical research institutions and hospitals show an increase of 16% and 15%, respectively. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the use of generative AI tools amongst researchers, with valuable implications for both academia and industry.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimate under a Nonstationary Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a rich variety of behaviors, have previously received little attention in the signal processing literature. During the pandemic, several works successfully leveraged state-of-the-art signal processing strategies to robustly infer epidemiological indicators despite the low quality of COVID-19 data. In the present work, a novel nonstationary autoregressive model is introduced, encompassing, but not reducing to, one of the most popular models for the propagation of viral epidemics. Using a variational framework, penalized likelihood estimators of the parameters of this new model are designed. In practice, the main bottleneck is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the nonstationary autoregressive Poisson model, the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, enabling to better account for intrinsic variability of the contamination while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the overall data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number and exemplified on real COVID-19 infection counts in different countries and at different stages of the pandemic, demonstrating its ability to yield consistent estimates.</description>

      <title>A three-state coupled Markov switching model for COVID-19 outbreaks across Quebec based on hospital admissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent COVID-19 outbreaks have placed immense strain on the hospital system in Quebec. We develop a Bayesian three-state coupled Markov switching model to analyze COVID-19 outbreaks across Quebec based on admissions in the 30 largest hospitals. Within each catchment area, we assume the existence of three states for the disease: absence, a new state meant to account for many zeroes in some of the smaller areas, endemic and outbreak. Then we assume the disease switches between the three states in each area through a series of coupled nonhomogeneous hidden Markov chains. Unlike previous approaches, the transition probabilities may depend on covariates and the occurrence of outbreaks in neighboring areas, to account for geographical outbreak spread. Additionally, to prevent rapid switching between endemic and outbreak periods we introduce clone states into the model which enforce minimum endemic and outbreak durations. We make some interesting findings, such as that mobility in retail and recreation venues had a positive association with the development and persistence of new COVID-19 outbreaks in Quebec. Based on model comparison our contributions show promise in improving state estimation retrospectively and in real-time, especially when there are smaller areas and highly spatially synchronized outbreaks. Furthermore, our approach offers new and interesting epidemiological interpretations, such as being able to estimate the effect of covariates on disease extinction.</description>

      <title>Identifying Spatiotemporal Patterns in Opioid Vulnerability: Investigating the Links Between Disability, Prescription Opioids and Opioid-Related Mortality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opioid crisis remains one of the most daunting and complex public health problems in the United States. This study investigates the national epidemic by analyzing vulnerability profiles of three key factors: opioid-related mortality rates, opioid prescription dispensing rates, and disability rank ordered rates. This study utilizes county level data, spanning the years 2014 through 2020, on the rates of opioid-related mortality, opioid prescription dispensing, and disability. To successfully estimate and predict trends in these opioid-related factors, we augment the Kalman Filter with a novel spatial component. To define opioid vulnerability profiles, we create heat maps of our filter's predicted rates across the nation's counties and identify the hotspots. In this context, hotspots are defined on a year-by-year basis as counties with rates in the top 5 percent nationally. Our spatial Kalman filter demonstrates strong predictive performance. From 2014 to 2018, these predictions highlight consistent spatiotemporal patterns across all three factors, with Appalachia distinguished as the nation's most vulnerable region. Starting in 2019 however, the dispensing rate profiles undergo a dramatic and chaotic shift. The initial primary drivers of opioid abuse in the Appalachian region were likely prescription opioids; however, it now appears that abuse is sustained by illegal drugs. Additionally, we find that the disabled subpopulation may be more at risk of opioid-related mortality than the general population. Public health initiatives must extend beyond controlling prescription practices to address the transition to and impact of illicit drug use.</description>

Abstract: We develop two statistical models for space-time abundance data based on a stochastic underlying continuous individual movement. In contrast to current models for abundance in statistical ecology, our models exploit the explicit connection between movement and counts, including the induced space-time auto-correlation. Our first model, called Snapshot, describes the counts of free moving individuals with a false-negative detection error. Our second model, called Capture, describes the capture and retention of moving individuals, and it follows an axiomatic approach based on three simple principles from which it is deduced that the density of the capture time is the solution of a Volterra integral equation of the second kind. Mild conditions are imposed to the underlying stochastic movement model, which is free to choose. We develop simulation methods for both models. The joint distribution of the space-time counts provides an example of a new multivariate distribution, here named the evolving categories multinomial distribution, for which we establish key properties. Since the general likelihood is intractable, we propose a pseudo-likelihood fitting method assuming multivariate Gaussianity respecting mean and covariance structures, justified by the central limit theorem. We conduct simulation studies to validate the method, and we fit our models to experimental data of a spreading population. We estimate movement parameters and compare our models to a basic ecological diffusion model. Movement parameters can be estimated using abundance data, but one must be aware of the necessary conditions to avoid underestimation of spread parameters.</description>

      <title>Nested Dirichlet models for unsupervised attack pattern detection in honeypot data</title>

Abstract: Cyber-systems are under near-constant threat from intrusion attempts. Attacks types vary, but each attempt typically has a specific underlying intent, and the perpetrators are typically groups of individuals with similar objectives. Clustering attacks appearing to share a common intent is very valuable to threat-hunting experts. This article explores Dirichlet distribution topic models for clustering terminal session commands collected from honeypots, which are special network hosts designed to entice malicious attackers. The main practical implications of clustering the sessions are two-fold: finding similar groups of attacks, and identifying outliers. A range of statistical models are considered, adapted to the structures of command-line syntax. In particular, concepts of primary and secondary topics, and then session-level and command-level topics, are introduced into the models to improve interpretability. The proposed methods are further extended in a Bayesian nonparametric fashion to allow unboundedness in the vocabulary size and the number of latent intents. The methods are shown to discover an unusual MIRAI variant which attempts to take over existing cryptocurrency coin-mining infrastructure, not detected by traditional topic-modelling approaches.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference for Continuous Multiple Time Point Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06645v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are limited options to estimate the treatment effects of variables which are continuous and measured at multiple time points, particularly if the true dose-response curve should be estimated as closely as possible. However, these situations may be of relevance: in pharmacology, one may be interested in how outcomes of people living with -- and treated for -- HIV, such as viral failure, would vary for time-varying interventions such as different drug concentration trajectories. A challenge for doing causal inference with continuous interventions is that the positivity assumption is typically violated. To address positivity violations, we develop projection functions, which reweigh and redefine the estimand of interest based on functions of the conditional support for the respective interventions. With these functions, we obtain the desired dose-response curve in areas of enough support, and otherwise a meaningful estimand that does not require the positivity assumption. We develop $g$-computation type plug-in estimators for this case. Those are contrasted with g-computation estimators which are applied to continuous interventions without specifically addressing positivity violations, which we propose to be presented with diagnostics. The ideas are illustrated with longitudinal data from HIV positive children treated with an efavirenz-based regimen as part of the CHAPAS-3 trial, which enrolled children $&lt;13$ years in Zambia/Uganda. Simulations show in which situations a standard g-computation approach is appropriate, and in which it leads to bias and how the proposed weighted estimation approach then recovers the alternative estimand of interest.</description>

      <title>A Dataset of Uniswap daily transaction indices by network</title>

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is reshaping traditional finance by enabling direct transactions without intermediaries, creating a rich source of open financial data. Layer 2 (L2) solutions are emerging to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem, surpassing Layer 1 (L1) systems. However, the impact of L2 solutions is still underexplored, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive transaction data indices for economic analysis. This study bridges that gap by analyzing over 50 million transactions from Uniswap, a major decentralized exchange, across both L1 and L2 networks. We created a set of daily indices from blockchain data on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, offering insights into DeFi adoption, scalability, decentralization, and wealth distribution. Additionally, we developed an open-source Python framework for calculating decentralization indices, making this dataset highly useful for advanced machine learning research. Our work provides valuable resources for data scientists and contributes to the growth of the intelligent Web3 ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Slopes and Their Applications in Social Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses two prominent theses in social stratification research, the great equalizer thesis and Mare's (1980) school transition thesis. Both theses describe the role of an intermediate educational transition in the association between socioeconomic status and an outcome variable. However, the descriptive regularities of the two theses may be driven by differential selection into the intermediate transition, which prevents the two theses from having substantive interpretations. We propose a set of novel counterfactual slope estimands, which capture these theses under hypothetical interventions that eliminate the differential selection. We thereby construct selection-free tests for these theses. Compared with the existing literature, we are the first to explicitly provide nonparametric causal estimands, which enable us to conduct more principled analysis. We are also the first to develop flexible, efficient, and robust estimators for the two theses based on efficient influence functions. We apply our framework to a nationally representative dataset in the United States and re-evaluate the two theses. Findings from our selection-free tests suggest that the descriptive regularities are misleading for the substantive interpretation of the great equalizer thesis, but not for that of the school transition thesis. Additionally, the counterfactual slopes also provide a new framework for evaluating the inequality impacts of policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Flexible Models for Simple Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for modelling simple longitudinal data. We aim to do this in a flexible manner (without restrictive assumptions about the shapes of individual trajectories), while exploiting structural similarities between the trajectories. Hierarchical models (such as linear mixed models, generalised additive mixed models and hierarchical generalised additive models) are commonly used to model longitudinal data, but fail to meet one or other of these requirements: either they make restrictive assumptions about the shape of individual trajectories, or fail to exploit structural similarities between trajectories. Functional principal components analysis promises to fulfil both requirements, and methods for functional principal components analysis have been developed for longitudinal data. However, we find that existing methods sometimes give poor-quality estimates of individual trajectories, particularly when the number of observations on each individual is small. We develop a new approach, which we call hierarchical modelling with functional principal components. Inference is conducted based on the full likelihood of all unknown quantities, with a penalty term to control the balance between fit to the data and smoothness of the trajectories. We run simulation studies to demonstrate that the new method substantially improves the quality of inference relative to existing methods across a range of examples, and apply the method to data on changes in body composition in adolescent girls.</description>

      <title>Predictive Analysis for Optimizing Port Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transport is a pivotal logistics mode for the long-distance and bulk transportation of goods. However, the intricate planning involved in this mode is often hindered by uncertainties, including weather conditions, cargo diversity, and port dynamics, leading to increased costs. Consequently, accurate estimation of the total (stay) time of the vessel and any delays at the port are essential for efficient planning and scheduling of port operations. This study aims to develop predictive analytics to address the shortcomings in the previous works of port operations for a vessels Stay Time and Delay Time, offering a valuable contribution to the field of maritime logistics. The proposed solution is designed to assist decision making in port environments and predict service delays. This is demonstrated through a case study on Brazil's ports. Additionally, feature analysis is used to understand the key factors impacting maritime logistics, enhancing the overall understanding of the complexities involved in port operations. Furthermore, we perform Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis to interpret the effects of the features on the outcomes and understand their impact on each sample, providing deeper insights into the factors influencing port operations.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices for measuring ex ante and ex post competitive balance in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while the ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the informativity of emission lines to infer physical conditions in giant molecular clouds. I. Application to model predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of ionic, atomic, or molecular lines are performed to improve our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the potential of a line to constrain the physical conditions of the ISM is difficult to assess quantitatively, because of the complexity of the ISM physics. The situation is even more complex when trying to assess which combinations of lines are the most useful. Therefore, observation campaigns usually try to observe as many lines as possible for as much time as possible. We search for a quantitative statistical criterion to evaluate the constraining power of a (or combination of) tracer(s) with respect to physical conditions in order to improve our understanding of the statistical relationships between ISM tracers and physical conditions and helps observers to motivate their observation proposals. The best tracers are obtained by comparing the mutual information between a physical parameter and different sets of lines. We apply this method to simulations of radio molecular lines emitted by a photodissociation region similar to the Horsehead Nebula that would be observed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We search for the best lines to constrain the visual extinction $A_v^{tot}$ or the far UV illumination $G_0$. The most informative lines change with the physical regime (e.g., cloud extinction). Short integration time of the CO isotopologue $J=1-0$ lines already yields much information on the total column density most regimes. The best set of lines to constrain the visual extinction does not necessarily combine the most informative individual lines. Precise constraints on $G_0$ are more difficult to achieve with molecular lines. They require spectral lines emitted at the cloud surface (e.g., [CII] and [CI] lines). This approach allows one to better explore the knowledge provided by ISM codes, and to guide future observation campaigns.</description>
