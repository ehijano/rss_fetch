      <title>A stochastic volatility approximation for a tick-by-tick price model with mean-field interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a tick-by-tick model of price formation, in which buy and sell orders are modeled as self-exciting point processes (Hawkes process), similar to the one in [El Euch, Fukasawa, Rosenbaum, The microstructural foundations of leverage effect and rough volatility, Finance and Stochastics, 2018]. We adopt an agent based approach by studying the aggregation of a large number of these point processes, mutually interacting in a mean-field sense.
  The financial interpretation is that of an asset on which several labeled agents place buy and sell orders following these point processes, influencing the price. The mean-field interaction introduces positive correlations between order volumes coming from different agents that reflect features of real markets such as herd behavior and contagion. When the large scale limit of the aggregated asset price is computed, if parameters are set to a critical value, a singular phenomenon occurs: the aggregated model converges to a stochastic volatility model with leverage effect and faster-than-linear mean reversion of the volatility process.
  The faster-than-linear mean reversion of the volatility process is supported by econometric evidence, and we have linked it in [Dai Pra, Pigato, Multi-scaling of moments in stochastic volatility models, Stochastic Processes and their Applications, 2015] to the observed multifractal behavior of assets prices and market indices. This seems connected to the Statistical Physics perspective that expects anomalous scaling properties to arise in the critical regime.</description>

      <title>Self-Exciting Random Evolutions (SEREs) and their Applications (Version 2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a new class of random evolutions (RE), so-called self-exciting random evolutions (SEREs), and their applications. We also introduce a new random process $x(t)$ such that it is based on a superposition of a Markov chain $x_n$ and a Hawkes process $N(t),$ i.e., $x(t):=x_{N(t)}.$ We call this process self-walking imbedded semi-Hawkes process (Swish Process or SwishP). Then the self-exciting REs (SEREs) can be constructed in similar way as, e.g., semi-Markov REs, but instead of semi-Markov process $x(t)$ we have SwishP. We give classifications and examples of self-exciting REs (SEREs). Then we consider two limit theorems for SEREs such as averaging (Theorem 1) and diffusion approximation (Theorem 2). Applications of SEREs are devoted to the so-called self-exciting traffic/transport process and self-exciting summation on a Markov chain, which are examples of continuous and discrete SERE. From these processes we can construct many other self-exciting processes, e.g., such as impulse traffic/transport process, self-exciting risk process, general compound Hawkes process for a stock price, etc. We present averaged and diffusion approximation of self-exciting processes. The novelty of the paper associated with new models, such as $x(t)$ and SERE, and also new features of SEREs and their many applications, namely, self-exciting and clustering effects.</description>
