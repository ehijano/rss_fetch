      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control with Control-Dependent Diffusion and State Constraints: A Degenerate Elliptic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic optimal control problem with the state constrained to a smooth, compact domain. The control influences both the drift and a possibly degenerate, control-dependent dispersion matrix, leading to a fully nonlinear, degenerate elliptic Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation with a nontrivial Neumann boundary condition. Although these features have been studied separately, this work provides the first unified treatment combining them all. We establish that the optimal value function associated with the control problem is the unique viscosity solution of the HJB equation with a nontrivial Neumann boundary condition, and we present an illustrative example demonstrating the applicability of the framework.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Barrier of Utility Maximization: An Interior-Point Approach for Market Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computation of equilibria in exchange markets with divisible goods and players endowed with heterogeneous utilities. In this paper, we revisit the polynomial-time interior-point strategies that update \emph{only} the prices, mirroring the t\^atonnement process. The key ingredient is the \emph{implicit barrier} inherent in the utility maximization: the utility turns unbounded when the goods are almost free of charge. Focusing on a ubiquitous class of utilities, we formalize this observation into Scaled Lipschitz Continuity for utility maximization from both the primal and dual perspectives. A companion result suggests that no additional effort is required for computing high-order derivatives; all the necessary information is readily available when collecting the best responses. To tackle the Newton systems, we present an explicitly invertible approximation of the Hessian operator with high probability guarantees, and a scaling matrix that minimizes the condition number of the linear system. Building on these tools, we design two inexact interior-point methods. One such method has O(ln(1/{\epsilon})) complexity rate. Under mild conditions, the other method achieves a non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate. Extensions and preliminary experiments are presented.</description>

      <title>Can SGD Handle Heavy-Tailed Noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of large-scale optimization, yet its theoretical behavior under heavy-tailed noise -- common in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we rigorously investigate whether vanilla SGD, devoid of any adaptive modifications, can provably succeed under such adverse stochastic conditions. Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded $p$-th moments for some $p \in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence guarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex problem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal sample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex regimes: $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively. For non-convex objectives under H\"older smoothness, we prove convergence to a stationary point with rate $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$, and complement this with a matching lower bound specific to SGD with arbitrary polynomial step-size schedules. Finally, we consider non-convex Mini-batch SGD under standard smoothness and bounded central moment assumptions, and show that it also achieves a comparable $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$ sample complexity with a potential improvement in the smoothness constant. These results challenge the prevailing view that heavy-tailed noise renders SGD ineffective, and establish vanilla SGD as a robust and theoretically principled baseline -- even in regimes where the variance is unbounded.</description>

      <title>A distributed augmented Lagrangian decomposition algorithm for constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Augmented Lagrangian (AL), we introduce a novel distributed optimization method called Distributed Augmented Lagrangian Decomposition (DALD). We provide a rigorous convergence proof for the standard version of this method, which is designed to tackle general constrained optimization problems. To address the high iteration costs in early stages, we propose several accelerated variants of DALD that enhances efficiency without compromising theoretical guarantees, supported by a comprehensive convergence analysis. To facilitate the description of the distributed optimization process, the concept of hierarchical coordination networks is introduced, integrating hierarchical matrix concepts to aid in this explanation. We further explore and expand the applicability of the DALD method and demonstrate how it unifies existing distributed optimization theories within the AL framework. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed distributed optimization method and its variants are further validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions and Relative Regularity Conditions for Polynomial Vector Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of the efficient solutions for polynomial vector optimization problems on a nonempty closed constraint set without any convexity and compactness assumptions. We first introduce the relative regularity conditions for vector optimization problems whose objective functions are a vector polynomial and investigate their properties and characterizations. Moreover, we establish relationships between the relative regularity conditions, Palais-Smale condition, weak Palais-Smale condition, M-tameness and properness with respect to some index set. Under the relative regularity and non-regularity conditions, we establish nonemptiness of the efficient solution sets of the polynomial vector optimization problems respectively. As a by-product, we infer Frank-Wolfe type theorems for a non-convex polynomial vector optimization problem. Finally, we study the local properties and genericity characteristics of the relative regularity conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an optimal control problem for a nonhomogeneous linear stochastic differential equation having regime switching with a quadratic functional in the large time horizon. This is a continuation of the paper \cite{Mei-Wang-Yong-2025}, in which the strong turnpike property was established for homogeneous linear systems with purely quadratic cost functionals. We extend the results to the current situation. It turns out that some of the results are new even for the cases without regime switchings.</description>

      <title>On Directed Graphs With Real Laplacian Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is reported that dynamical systems over digraphs have superior performance in terms of system damping and tolerance to time delays if the underlying graph Laplacian has a purely real spectrum. This paper investigates the topological conditions under which digraphs possess real or complex Laplacian spectra. We derive sufficient conditions for digraphs, which possibly contain self-loops and negative-weighted edges, to have real Laplacian spectra. The established conditions generally imply that a real Laplacian spectrum is linked to the absence of the so-called digon sign-asymmetric interactions and non-strong connectivity in any subgraph of the digraph. Then, two classes of digraphs with complex Laplacian spectra are identified, which imply that the occurrence of directed cycles is a major factor to cause complex Laplacian eigenvalues. Moreover, we extend our analysis to multilayer digraphs, where strategies for preserving real/complex spectra from graph interconnection are proposed. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the obtained results can effectively guide the redesign of digraph topologies for a better performance.</description>

      <title>Computing stabilizing feedback gains for stochastic linear systems via policy iteration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, stabilizing unknown dynamical systems has became a critical problem in control systems engineering. Addressing this for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems is an essential fist step towards solving similar problems for more complex systems. In this paper, we develop a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to compute stabilizing feedback gains for stochastic LTI systems with unknown system matrices. This algorithm proceeds by solving a series of discounted stochastic linear quadratic (SLQ) optimal control problems via policy iteration (PI). And the corresponding discount factor gradually decreases according to an explicit rule, which is derived from the equivalent condition in verifying the stabilizability. We prove that this method can return a stabilizer after finitely many steps. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Voltage Support Procurement in Transmission Grids: Incentive Design via Online Bilevel Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources into transmission grid operations presents a complex challenge, particularly in the context of reactive power procurement for voltage support. This paper addresses this challenge by formulating the voltage regulation problem as a Stackelberg game, where the Transmission System Operator (TSO) designs incentives to guide the reactive power responses of Distribution System Operators (DSOs). We utilize a gradient-based iterative algorithm that updates the incentives to ensure that DSOs adjust their reactive power injections to maintain voltage stability. We incorporate principles from online feedback optimization to enable real-time implementation, utilizing voltage measurements in both TSO's and DSOs' policies. This approach not only enhances the robustness against model uncertainties and changing operating conditions but also facilitates the co-design of incentives and automation. Numerical experiments on a 5-bus transmission grid demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving voltage regulation while accommodating the strategic interactions of self-interested DSOs.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust System Level Synthesis With Output Feedback Affine Control Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the finite-horizon robust optimal control of linear systems subject to model mismatch and additive stochastic disturbances. Utilizing the system level synthesis (SLS) parameterization, we propose a novel SLS design using output-feedback affine control policy and extend it to a distributionally robust setting to improve system resilience by minimizing the cost function while ensuring constraint satisfaction against the worst-case uncertainty distribution. The scopes of model mismatch and stochastic disturbances are quantified using the 1-norm and a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, respectively. For the closed-loop dynamics, we analyze the distributional shift between the predicted output-input response -- computed using nominal parameters and empirical disturbance samples -- and the actual closed-loop distribution, highlighting its dependence on model mismatch and SLS parameterization. Assuming convex and Lipschitz continuous cost functions and constraints, we derive a tractable reformulation of the distributionally robust SLS (DR-SLS) problem by leveraging tools from robust control and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Exact and Heuristic Algorithms for Constrained Biclustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biclustering, also known as co-clustering or two-way clustering, simultaneously partitions the rows and columns of a data matrix to reveal submatrices with coherent patterns. Incorporating background knowledge into clustering to enhance solution quality and interpretability has attracted growing interest in mathematical optimization and machine learning research. Extending this paradigm to biclustering enables prior information to guide the joint grouping of rows and columns. We study constrained biclustering with pairwise constraints, namely must-link and cannot-link constraints, which specify whether objects should belong to the same or different biclusters. As a model problem, we address the constrained version of the k-densest disjoint biclique problem, which aims to identify k disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs (called bicliques) in a weighted complete bipartite graph, maximizing the total density while satisfying pairwise constraints. We propose both exact and heuristic algorithms. The exact approach is a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm based on a low-dimensional semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, strengthened with valid inequalities and solved in a cutting-plane fashion. Exploiting integer programming tools, a rounding scheme converts SDP solutions into feasible biclusterings at each node. For large-scale instances, we introduce an efficient heuristic based on the low-rank factorization of the SDP. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is tackled with an augmented Lagrangian method, where the subproblem is solved by decomposition through a block-coordinate projected gradient algorithm. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the exact method significantly outperforms general-purpose solvers, while the heuristic achieves high-quality solutions efficiently on large instances.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Dynamic Games and Probability: Decision Making in Stochastic Extensive Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, an abstract and general language for the fundamental objects underlying dynamic games under probabilistic uncertainty is developed. Combining the theory of decision trees by Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2005) and a Harsanyian notion of exogenous uncertainty, the concept of stochastic decision forests is introduced. Exogenous information is modelled via filtration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the "realised tree", and an abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.
  Based on this, a consistent model of "rules" is introduced, leading to the notion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of order-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of stochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems formulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an approximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In this formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis is essentially well-ordered.
  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of "extensive form characteristics" is introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from well-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence, which is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction behaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is tackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a suitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a natural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium. The theory applies to stochastic differential and timing games, e.g., addressing issues in Fudenberg--Tirole (1985) and Riedel--Steg (2017) .</description>

      <title>On the optimization of discrepancy measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Points in the unit cube with low discrepancy can be constructed using algebra or, more recently, by direct computational optimization of a criterion. The usual $L_\infty$ star discrepancy is a poor criterion for this because it is computationally expensive and lacks differentiability. Its usual replacement, the $L_2$ star discrepancy, is smooth but exhibits other pathologies shown by J. Matou\v{s}ek. In an attempt to address these problems, we introduce the \textit{average squared discrepancy} which averages over $2^d$ versions of the $L_2$ star discrepancy anchored in the different vertices of $[0,1]^d$. Not only can this criterion be computed in $O(dn^2)$ time, like the $L_2$ star discrepancy, but also we show that it is equivalent to a weighted symmetric $L_2$ criterion of Hickernell's by a constant factor. We compare this criterion with a wide range of traditional discrepancy measures, and show that only the average squared discrepancy avoids the problems raised by Matou\v{s}ek. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive numerical study showing in particular that optimizing for the average squared discrepancy leads to strong performance for the $L_2$ star discrepancy, whereas the converse does not hold.</description>

      <title>Compressed Decentralized Momentum Stochastic Gradient Methods for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides, because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance. Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Alternating Simulations for Policy Synthesis in Uncertain Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical approach to formal policy synthesis in stochastic dynamical systems is to construct a finite-state abstraction, often represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). The correctness of these approaches hinges on a behavioural relation between the dynamical system and its abstraction, such as a probabilistic simulation relation. However, probabilistic simulation relations do not suffice when the system dynamics are, next to being stochastic, also subject to nondeterministic (i.e., set-valued) disturbances. In this work, we extend probabilistic simulation relations to systems with both stochastic and nondeterministic disturbances. Our relation, which is inspired by a notion of alternating simulation, generalises existing relations used for verification and policy synthesis used in several works. Intuitively, our relation allows reasoning probabilistically over stochastic uncertainty, while reasoning robustly (i.e., adversarially) over nondeterministic disturbances. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our relations for policy synthesis in a 4D-state Dubins vehicle.</description>

Abstract: Wireless networks are evolving from radio resource providers to complex systems that also involve computing, with the latter being distributed across edge and cloud facilities. Also, their optimization is shifting more and more from a performance to a value-oriented paradigm. The two aspects shall be balanced continuously, to maximize the utilities of Services Providers (SPs), users quality of experience and fairness, while meeting global constraints in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint among others, with all these heterogeneous resources contributing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of communication and compute resource allocation under energy constraints, with multiple SPs competing to get their preferred resource bundle by spending a a fictitious currency budget. By modeling the network as a Fisher market, we propose a low complexity solution able to achieve high utilities and guarantee energy constraints, while also promoting fairness among SPs, as compared to a social optimal solution. The market equilibrium is proved mathematically, and numerical results show the multi-dimensional trade-off between utility and energy at different locations, with communication and computation-intensive services.</description>

      <title>Preparing for the worst: Long-term and short-term weather extremes in resource adequacy assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security of supply is a common and important concern when integrating renewables in net-zero power systems. Extreme weather affects both demand and supply leading to power system stress; in Europe this stress spreads continentally beyond the meteorological root cause. We use an approach based on shadow prices to identify periods of elevated stress called system-defining events and analyse their impact on the power system. By classifying different types of system-defining events, we identify challenges to power system operation and planning. Crucially, we find the need for sufficient resilience back-up (power) capacities whose financial viability is precarious due to weather variability. Furthermore, we disentangle short- and long-term resilience challenges with distinct metrics and stress tests to incorporate both into future energy modelling assessments. Our methodology and implementation in the open model PyPSA-Eur can be re-applied to other systems and help researchers and policymakers in building more resilient and adequate energy systems.</description>

      <title>A viscosity solution as a piecewise classical solution to a free boundary problem for the optimal switching problem with simultaneous multiple switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \citeN{suzuki2020optimal} proves the uniqueness of the viscosity solution to a variational inequality which is solved by the value function of the infinite horizon optimal switching problem with simultaneous multiple switchings. Although it also identifies each connected region possibly including at most one connected switching region, the exact switching regions of the solution are not identified. The problem is finally converted into a system of free boundary problems and generally solved by the numerical calculation. However, if the PDE part of the variational inequality has a classical solution, the viscosity solution may be constructed as a series of piecewise classical solutions, possibly analytical.
  Under a certain assumption we prove that the series of piecewise classical solutions is indeed the viscosity solution on $\real{}$, after we prove the smooth pasting condition is its necessary condition, and establish the algorithm to compute all the free boundaries. Applying the results to the concrete problem studied in \citeN{suzuki2020optimal} we find the explicit solution and identify the continuation and switching regions in a computer with Python programs.</description>

Abstract: Optimal control theory in epidemiology has been used to establish the most effective intervention strategies for managing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases while considering constraints and costs. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, indirect methods provide necessary optimality conditions by transforming the control problem into a two-point boundary value problem. However, these approaches are often sensitive to initial guesses and can be computationally challenging, especially when dealing with complex constraints. In contrast, direct methods, which discretise the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation, could offer robust, adaptable solutions for real-time decision-making. Despite their potential, the widespread adoption of these techniques has been limited, which may be due to restricted access to specialised software, perceived high costs, or unfamiliarity with these methods. This study investigates the feasibility, robustness, and potential of direct optimal control methods using nonlinear programming solvers on compartmental models described by ordinary differential equations to determine the best application of various interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination strategies. Through case studies, we demonstrate the use of NLP solvers to determine the optimal application of interventions based on single objectives, such as minimising total infections, "flattening the curve", or reducing peak infection levels, as well as multi-objective optimisation to achieve the best combination of interventions. While indirect methods provide useful theoretical insights, direct approaches may be a better fit for the fast-evolving challenges of real-world epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Growth Schedules for Batch Size and Learning Rate in SGD that Reduce SFO Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Batch Size and Learning Rate Scheduler for Stochastic Gradient Descent Based on Minimization of Stochastic First-order Oracle Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training. Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing schedulers.</description>

      <title>Aircraft routing: periodicity and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aircraft routing problem is one of the most studied problems of operations research applied to aircraft management. It involves assigning flights to aircraft while ensuring regular visits to maintenance bases. This paper examines two aspects of the problem.
  First, we explore the relationship between periodic instances, where flights are the same every day, and periodic solutions. The literature has implicitly assumed-without discussion-that periodic instances necessitate periodic solutions, and even periodic solutions in a stronger form, where every two airplanes perform either the exact same cyclic sequence of flights, or completely disjoint cyclic sequences. However, enforcing such periodicity may eliminate feasible solutions. We prove that, when regular maintenance is required at most every four days, there always exist periodic solutions of this form.
  Second, we consider the computational hardness of the problem. Even if many papers in this area refer to the NP-hardness of the aircraft routing problem, such a result is only available in the literature for periodic instances. We establish its NP-hardness for a non-periodic version. Polynomiality of a special but natural case is also proven.</description>

      <title>X-VFL: A New Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Cross Completion and Decision Subspace Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However, VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii) the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client). To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and locally independent inference.</description>

      <title>High-Order Error Bounds for Markovian LSA with Richardson-Romberg Extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the bias and high-order error bounds of the Linear Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging under Markovian noise. We focus on the version of the algorithm with constant step size $\alpha$ and propose a novel decomposition of the bias via a linearization technique. We analyze the structure of the bias and show that the leading-order term is linear in $\alpha$ and cannot be eliminated by PR averaging. To address this, we apply the Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation procedure, which effectively cancels the leading bias term. We derive high-order moment bounds for the RR iterates and show that the leading error term aligns with the asymptotically optimal covariance matrix of the vanilla averaged LSA iterates.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Data Driven Model for Generation Expansion Planning with Short Term Operational Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.04986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generation expansion planning (GEP) models have been useful aids for long-term planning. Recent growth in intermittent renewable generation has increased the need to represent the capability for non-renewables to respond to rapid changes in daily loads, leading research to bring unit commitment (UC) features into GEPs. Such GEP+UC models usually contain discrete variables which, along with many details, make computation times impractically long for analysts who need to develop, debug, modify and use the GEP for many alternative runs. We propose a GEP with generation aggregated by technology type, and with the minimal UC content necessary to represent the limitations on generation to respond to rapid changes in demand, i.e., ramp-up and ramp-down constraints, with ramp limits estimated from historical data on maximum rates of change of each generation type. We illustrate with data for the province of Ontario in Canada; the GEP is a large scale linear program that solves in less than one hour on modest computing equipment, with credible solutions.</description>

Abstract: The subgraph-subgraph matching problem is, given a pair of graphs and a positive integer $K$, to find $K$ vertices in the first graph, $K$ vertices in the second graph, and a bijection between them, so as to minimize the number of adjacency disagreements across the bijection; it is ``seeded" if some of this bijection is fixed. The problem is intractable, and we present the ssSGM algorithm, which uses Frank-Wolfe methodology to efficiently find an approximate solution. Then, in the context of a generalized correlated random Bernoulli graph model, in which the pair of graphs naturally have a core of $K$ matched pairs of vertices, we provide and prove mild conditions for the subgraph-subgraph matching problem solution to almost always be the correct $K$ matched pairs of vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14297v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis method for robust, regret optimal control. The plant is modeled in discrete-time by an uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An optimal non-causal controller is constructed using the nominal plant model and given full knowledge of the disturbance. Robust regret is defined relative to the performance of this optimal non-causal control. It is shown that a controller achieves robust regret if and only if it satisfies a robust $H_\infty$ performance condition. DK-iteration can be used to synthesize a controller that satisfies this condition and hence achieve a given level of robust regret. The approach is demonstrated three examples: (i) a simple single-input, single-output classical design, (ii) a longitudinal control for a simplified model for a Boeing 747 model, and (iii) an active suspension for a quarter car model. All examples compare the robust regret optimal against regret optimal controllers designed without uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method to drive a nonlinear system to a desired state, with limited a priori knowledge of its dynamic model: local dynamics at a single point and the bounds on the rate of change of these dynamics. This method synthesizes control actions by utilizing locally learned dynamics along a trajectory, based on data available up to that moment, and known proxy dynamics, which can generate an underapproximation of the unknown system's true reachable set. An important benefit to the contributions of this paper is the lack of knowledge needed to execute the presented control method. We establish sufficient conditions to ensure that a controlled trajectory reaches a small neighborhood of any provably reachable state within a short time horizon, with precision dependent on the tunable parameters of these conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of solving strongly convex and smooth minimization problems using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with a constant step size. Previous works suggested to combine the Polyak-Ruppert averaging procedure with the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation to reduce the asymptotic bias of SGD at the expense of a mild increase of the variance. We significantly extend previous results by providing an expansion of the mean-squared error of the resulting estimator with respect to the number of iterations $n$. We show that the root mean-squared error can be decomposed into the sum of two terms: a leading one of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ with explicit dependence on a minimax-optimal asymptotic covariance matrix, and a second-order term of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-3/4})$, where the power $3/4$ is best known. We also extend this result to the higher-order moment bounds. Our analysis relies on the properties of the SGD iterates viewed as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. In particular, we establish that this chain is geometrically ergodic with respect to a suitably defined weighted Wasserstein semimetric.</description>

In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>

      <title>Model Consistency of the Iterative Regularization of Dual Ascent for Low-Complexity Regularization</title>

Abstract: Regularization is a core component of modern inverse problems, as it helps establish the well-posedness of the solution of interest. Popular regularization approaches include variational regularization and iterative regularization. The former involves solving a variational optimization problem, which consists of a data-fidelity term and a regularization term, balanced by an appropriate weighting parameter. The latter mitigates overfitting to noise by selecting a suitable stopping time during the iterative process. A key topic in the study of regularization is the relationship between the regularized solution and the original ground truth. When the ground truth possesses a low-complexity structure referred to as the "model" it can be shown that under appropriate regularization promoting the same structure, the solution to the regularized problem is robust to small perturbations. This property is called "model consistency". For variational regularization, model consistency in linear inverse problems has been studied in [1]. However, for iterative regularization, model consistency remains an open question. In this paper, building on recent developments in partial smoothness [1], we show that when the noise level is sufficiently small and an appropriate stopping criterion is used, iterative regularization is model consistent as well. Moreover, we show that the considered algorithm exhibits local linear behavior of the regularization. We provide numerical simulations to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>RideAgent: An LLM-Enhanced Optimization Framework for Automated Taxi Fleet Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06608</link>

Abstract: Efficient management of electric ride-hailing fleets, particularly pre-allocation and pricing during peak periods to balance spatio-temporal supply and demand, is crucial for urban traffic efficiency. However, practical challenges include unpredictable demand and translating diverse, qualitative managerial objectives from non-expert operators into tractable optimization models. This paper introduces RideAgent, an LLM-powered agent framework that automates and enhances electric ride-hailing fleet management. First, an LLM interprets natural language queries from fleet managers to formulate corresponding mathematical objective functions. These user-defined objectives are then optimized within a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) framework, subject to the constraint of maintaining high operational profit. The profit itself is a primary objective, estimated by an embedded Random Forest (RF) model leveraging exogenous features. To accelerate the solution of this MIP, a prompt-guided LLM analyzes a small sample of historical optimal decision data to guide a variable fixing strategy. Experiments on real-world data show that the LLM-generated objectives achieve an 86% text similarity to standard formulations in a zero-shot setting. Following this, the LLM-guided variable fixing strategy reduces computation time by 53.15% compared to solving the full MIP with only a 2.42% average optimality gap. Moreover, this variable fixing strategy outperforms five cutting plane methods by 42.3% time reduction with minimal compromise to solution quality. RideAgent offers a robust and adaptive automated framework for objective modeling and accelerated optimization. This framework empowers non-expert fleet managers to personalize operations and improve urban transportation system performance.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of a Bicriteria Directed Multimodal Transportation Network Design Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a bicriteria network design problem that arises from practical applications in urban and rural public transportation planning. We establish the problem's complexity and demonstrate inapproximability results, highlighting the inherent difficulties in finding optimal solutions. Additionally, we identify special cases where approximability can be achieved, providing valuable insights for practitioners. Our proofs leverage complexity results related to directed network design problems, an area that has received limited attention in the existing literature. By investigating these complexity results, we aim to fill a critical gap and enhance the understanding of the interplay between bicriteria decision-making and network design challenges.</description>

      <title>On Relatively Smooth Optimization over Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimization over Riemannian embedded submanifolds, where the objective function is relatively smooth in the ambient Euclidean space. Such problems have broad applications but are still largely unexplored. We introduce two Riemannian first-order methods, namely the retraction-based and projection-based Riemannian Bregman gradient methods, by incorporating the Bregman distance into the update steps. The retraction-based method can handle nonsmooth optimization; at each iteration, the update direction is generated by solving a convex optimization subproblem constrained to the tangent space. We show that when the reference function is of the quartic form $h(x) = \frac{1}{4}\|x\|^4 + \frac{1}{2}\|x\|^2$, the constraint subproblem admits a closed-form solution. The projection-based approach can be applied to smooth Riemannian optimization, which solves an unconstrained subproblem in the ambient Euclidean space. Both methods are shown to achieve an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate Riemannian stationary point. When the manifold is compact, we further develop stochastic variants and establish a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$. Numerical experiments on the nonlinear eigenvalue problem and low-rank quadratic sensing problem demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Stochastic Non-smooth Non-convex Optimization through Online-to-Non-convex Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new algorithms for optimizing non-smooth, non-convex stochastic objectives based on a novel analysis technique. This improves the current best-known complexity for finding a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary point from $O(\epsilon^{-4}\delta^{-1})$ stochastic gradient queries to $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$, which we also show to be optimal. Our primary technique is a reduction from non-smooth non-convex optimization to online learning, after which our results follow from standard regret bounds in online learning. For deterministic and second-order smooth objectives, applying more advanced optimistic online learning techniques enables a new complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1.5}\delta^{-0.5})$. Our techniques also recover all optimal or best-known results for finding $\epsilon$ stationary points of smooth or second-order smooth objectives in both stochastic and deterministic settings.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate Rigid Alignment in a Patch Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set of overlapping local views (patches) of a dataset, we consider the problem of finding a rigid alignment of the views that minimizes a $2$-norm based alignment error. In general, the views are noisy and a perfect alignment may not exist. In this work, we characterize the non-degeneracy of an alignment in the noisy setting based on the kernel and positivity of a certain matrix. This leads to a polynomial time algorithm for testing the non-degeneracy of a given alignment. Subsequently, we focus on Riemannian gradient descent for minimizing the alignment error, providing a sufficient condition on an alignment for the algorithm to converge (locally) linearly to it. \revadd{Additionally, we provide an exact recovery and noise stability analysis of the algorithm}. In the case of noiseless views, a perfect alignment exists, resulting in a realization of the points that respects the geometry of the views. Under a mild condition on the views, we show that a non-degenerate perfect alignment \revadd{characterizes the infinitesimally rigidity of a realization, and thus the local rigidity of a generic realization}. By specializing the non-degeneracy conditions to the noiseless case, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the overlapping structure of the views for \revadd{a perfect alignment to be non-degenerate and equivalently, for the resulting realization to be infinitesimally rigid}. Similar results are also derived regarding the uniqueness of a perfect alignment and global rigidity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient-Descent Calibration of Pyragas Delayed-Feedback Control for Chaos Suppression in the Sprott Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores chaos control in the Sprott circuit by leveraging Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to calibrate Pyragas delayed feedback control. Using a third-order nonlinear differential equation, we model the circuit and aim to suppress chaos by optimizing control parameters (gain $K$, delay $T_{\text{con}}$) and the variable resistor $R_v$. Experimental voltage data, extracted from published figures via WebPlotDigitizer, serve as the calibration target. We compare two calibration techniques: sum of squared errors (SSE) minimization via grid search and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with finite differences. Joint optimization of $K$, $T_{\text{con}}$, and $R_v$ using SGD achieves superior alignment with experimental data, capturing both phase and amplitude with high fidelity. Compared to grid search, SGD excels in phase synchronization, though minor amplitude discrepancies persist due to model simplifications. Phase space analysis confirms the model ability to replicate the chaotic attractor geometry, despite slight deviations. We analyze the trade-off between calibration accuracy and computational cost, highlighting scalability challenges. Overall, SGD-based calibration demonstrates significant potential for precise control of chaotic systems, advancing mathematical modeling and applications in electrical engineering.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Mechanism for Municipal Soft-Budget Constraints in Newfoundland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft-budget pressures due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource revenues. We develop a Stackelberg-style mechanism-design model in which the province commits at initial stage to an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal-need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single-crossing (or virtual monotonicity with ironing), the problem reduces to one-dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal rule is threshold--linear--cap: no bailouts below a participation cutoff; a linear ramp-up up to a cap; and a hard cap thereafter. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no-bailout regime, and an explicit discount-factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. The closed-form characterisation provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration.</description>
