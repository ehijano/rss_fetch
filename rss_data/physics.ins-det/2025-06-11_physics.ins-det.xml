      <title>Response to cosmic muons of scintillator-SiPM assemblies measured at different temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly segmented calorimeters represent a modern trend in experimental particle physics aimed at improving the energy resolution with the particle flow reconstruction. The widely used and cost-effective solution is the structure assembled from small scintillator elements readout by tiny photosensors. The improvement of signal to noise ratio can be achieved by operating at low temperatures. The paper presents studies of temperature dependence of response to muons for elements comprised of plastic scintillator tiles with different options of reflective coverage and read out by silicon photomultipliers. No temperature dependence of response for bare tiles has been detected. With reflective film, the reduction of response with decreasing temperature is observed. The measured effect amounts to 10% in the range from +30oC to -30oC.</description>

      <title>A pipeline for Megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy on soft matter samples at the MID instrument of European XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the experimental protocol and data processing framework for Megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) experiments on soft matter samples, implemented at the Materials Imaging and Dynamics (MID) instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL). Due to the introduction of a standard configuration and the implementation of a highly automated data processing pipeline, MHz-XPCS measurements can now be conducted and analyzed with minimal user intervention. A key challenge lies in managing the extremely large data volumes generated by the Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) - often reaching several petabytes within a single experiment. We describe the technical implementation, discuss the hardware requirements related to effective parallel data processing, and propose strategies to enhance data quality, in particular related to data reduction strategies and an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we address strategies for making the processed data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), in alignment with the goals of the DAPHNE4NFDI project.</description>

      <title>Picosecond resolution photoelectron emission lifetime detection system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a new photoelectron emission lifetime detection system. It is based on a recently developed Radio Frequency Timing technique of keV electrons and a 40 MHz, ultrafast pulsed laser. The photoelectron emission lifetimes from gold, monolayer MoS$_2$ and monolayer graphene were measured. As expected, we do not observe delayed electrons from gold, and the time distribution of the produced photoelectrons represents the time resolution of the device, which is $\sim$12~ps. From the graphene, we observed delayed photoelectrons with a lifetime of $\sim$189~ps.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in a squeezed-light-enhanced multiparameter quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer (BBOPM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a complex interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action.</description>

      <title>Mic-hackathon 2024: Hackathon on Machine Learning for Electron and Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.

      <title>Compact magnetic field cycling system with the range from nT to 9.4 T exemplified with 13C relaxation dispersion and SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compact magnetic field cycling system for high-resolution NMR spectrometers. The system enables the transfer of the sample from B0 field of 9.4 T to about nT and all fields in between within 1 second. Utilizing a flexible gear rod made the shuttling system more compact, reducing the height to about the height required for filling liquid helium - hence, it can be installed in average-size NMR laboratories (the height of NMR with MFC is only 3.32 m). The system utility is exemplified by measuring T1 relaxation dispersion of the most common liquid state hyperpolarization tracer - [1-13C]pyruvate - and magnetic field dependences of signal amplification by reversible exchange enabling alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH) hyperpolarization of [15N]pyridine. Using the system, we uncovered the exact relaxation of the pyruvate for a common preclinical dDNP sample composition and gave quantitative estimates for the retained polarization after sample transfer. We modified the observation protocol of SABRE-SHEATH polarization, which, with the high reproducibility of the MFC, provided us with a method to measure the chemical exchange rates of hyperpolarized compounds.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Crystalline Defects in 4H Silicon Carbide using DLTS and TSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future hadron collider experiments will require sensing materials that withstand stronger radiation fields. Therefore, either a frequent replacement of detectors, a significant increase in radiation hardness of Silicon, or a shift to different materials is needed. Wide-bandgap materials are a natural choice, due to their significantly reduced leakage currents, even after irradiation. In recent years, substantial progress in the production of high-quality monocrystalline Silicon Carbide of the 4H polytype has led to a renewed interest in this material. In this article, a study of electrically active defects in a n-type epitaxial 4H Silicon Carbide diode is presented. By employing spectroscopical measurement methods, like Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Thermally Stimulated Currents (TSC), energy levels in the bandgap are investigated. Defect parameters like concentration, activation energy and capture cross-section are stated. A simulation framework was utilised to compare and match the results from the two methods. This study is made in the context of a study of radiation hardness of 4H Silicon Carbide sensors. Other studies investigating macroscopic properties of the material, like their charge collection efficiency after irradiation, were performed on the same kind of diodes. This study provides a first set of measured defect parameters in state-of-the-art 4H-SiC material, from defects present prior to irradiation. These defects are intrinsic, such as vacancies, related to impurities and doping imperfections, or are growth related. The $Z_\text{1/2}$ defect and a Nitrogen related defect were identified.</description>
