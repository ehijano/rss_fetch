      <title>Connectivity-Preserving Important Separators: Enumeration and an Improved FPT Algorithm for Node Multiway Cut-Uncut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for handling graph separation problems with connectivity constraints. Extending the classical concept of important separators, we introduce and analyze connectivity-preserving important separators, which are important separators that not only disconnect designated terminal sets $A$ and $B$ but also satisfy an arbitrary set of connectivity constraints over the terminals. These constraints can express requirements such as preserving the internal connectivity of each terminal set, enforcing pairwise connections defined by an equivalence relation, or maintaining reachability from a specified subset of vertices. We prove that for any graph $G=(V,E)$, terminal sets $A,B\subseteq V$, and integer $k$, the number of important $A,B$-separators of size at most $k$ satisfying a set of connectivity constraints is bounded by $2^{O(k\log k)}$, and that all such separators can be enumerated within $O(2^{O(k\log k)} \cdot n \cdot T(n,m))$ time, where $T(n,m)$ is the time required to compute a minimum $s,t$-separator. As an application, we obtain a new fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for the Node Multiway Cut-Uncut (N-MWCU) problem, parameterized by $k$, the size of the separator set. The algorithm runs in $O(2^{O(k\log k)} \cdot n \cdot m^{1+o(1)})$ time for graphs with polynomially-bounded integer weights. This significantly improves the dependence on $k$ from the previous $2^{O(k^2\log k)}$ to $2^{O(k\log k)}$, thereby breaking a long-standing barrier, and simultaneously improves the polynomial factors. Our framework generalises the important-separator paradigm to separation problems in which the deletion set must satisfy both cut and uncut constraints on terminal subsets, thus offering a refined combinatorial foundation for designing fixed-parameter algorithms for cut-uncut problems in graphs.</description>

      <title>Real Time Proportional Throughput Maximization: How much advance notice should you give your scheduler?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will be exploring a generalization of real time scheduling problem sometimes called the real time throughput maximization problem. Our input is a sequence of jobs specified by their release time, deadline and processing time. We assume that jobs are announced before or at their release time. At each time step, the algorithm must decide whether to schedule a job based on the information so far. The goal is to maximize the value of the sum of the processing times of jobs that finish before their deadline, or the total ``active'' time.
  We extend this problem by defining a notion of $t$-advance-notice, a measure of how far in advance each job is given relative to their processing time. We show that there exists a $\frac{t}{2t+1}$-competitive algorithm when all jobs have $t$-advance-notice for $t\in [0,1]$. We also show that this ratio is optimal for all algorithms with $t$-advance-notice and that the upper bound of $\frac{t}{2t+1}$-competitiveness holds for all $t$, in particular that regardless of how much advance-notice is given, no algorithm can reach $\frac{1}{2}$-competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Optimal Online Bipartite Matching in Degree-2 Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a classical problem in online algorithms and we know that both the deterministic fractional and randomized integral online matchings achieve the same competitive ratio of $1-\frac{1}{e}$. In this work, we study classes of graphs where the online degree is restricted to $2$. As expected, one can achieve a competitive ratio of better than $1-\frac{1}{e}$ in both the deterministic fractional and randomized integral cases, but surprisingly, these ratios are not the same. It was already known that for fractional matching, a $0.75$ competitive ratio algorithm is optimal. We show that the folklore \textsc{Half-Half} algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $\eta \approx 0.717772\dots$ and more surprisingly, show that this is optimal by giving a matching lower-bound. This yields a separation between the two problems: deterministic fractional and randomized integral, showing that it is impossible to obtain a perfect rounding scheme.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Online Inventory Balancing to Inventory Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classic adversarial online resource allocation problems such as AdWords, customers arrive online while products are given offline with a fixed initial inventory. To ensure revenue guarantees under uncertainty, the decision maker must balance consumption across products. Based on this, the prevalent policy "inventory balancing (IB)" has proved to be optimal or near-optimal competitive in almost all classic settings. However, these models do not capture various forms of inventory shocks on the supply side, which play an important role in real-world online assortment and can significantly impact the revenue performance of the IB algorithm.
  Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce a variant of online assortment planning with inventory shocks. Our model considers adversarial exogenous shocks (where supply increases unpredictably) and allocation-coupled endogenous shocks (where an inventory reduction is triggered by the algorithms and re-adjusted after a usage duration), whose combination leads to non-monotonic inventory fluctuations. As our main result, we show the robustness of IB-type strategies against such shocks by designing a new family of optimal competitive algorithms called "Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)." Using a novel randomized primal-dual method, we bound the competitive ratio of BIB against optimal offline. We show that with proper choice of a certain parameter, this competitive ratio is asymptotically optimal and converges to (1-1/e) as initial inventories grow, in contrast to the original IB which no longer achieves the optimal ratio in this new model. Moreover, we characterize BIB's competitive ratio parametric by its penalty function and show that it matches exactly the competitive ratio of IB without shocks. Our refined analysis reduces the dual construction to a combinatorial "interval assignment problem" whose algorithmic solution may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Online Algorithms for Nonclairvoyant Joint Replenishment Problem with Deadlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers using predictions in the context of the online Joint Replenishment Problem with Deadlines (JRP-D). Prior work includes asymptotically optimal competitive ratios of $O(1)$ for the clairvoyant setting and $O(\sqrt{n})$ of the nonclairvoyant setting, where $n$ is the number of items. The goal of this paper is to significantly reduce the competitive ratio for the nonclairvoyant case by leveraging predictions: when a request arrives, the true deadline of the request is not revealed, but the algorithm is given a predicted deadline.
  The main result is an algorithm whose competitive ratio is $O(\min(\eta^{1/3}\log^{2/3}(n), \sqrt{\eta}, \sqrt{n}))$, where $n$ is the number of item types and $\eta\leq n^2$ quantifies how flawed the predictions are in terms of the number of ``instantaneous item inversions.'' Thus, the algorithm is robust, i.e., it is never worse than the nonclairvoyant solution, and it is consistent, i.e., if the predictions exhibit no inversions, then the algorithm behaves similarly to the clairvoyant algorithm. Moreover, if the error is not too large, specifically $\eta &lt; o(n^{3/2}/\log^2(n))$, then the algorithm obtains an asymptotically better competitive ratio than the nonclairvoyant algorithm. We also show that all deterministic algorithms falling in a certain reasonable class of algorithms have a competitive ratio of $\Omega(\eta^{1/3})$, so this algorithm is nearly the best possible with respect to this error metric.</description>

      <title>Online Graph Coloring for $k$-Colorable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of online graph coloring for $k$-colorable graphs. The best previously known deterministic algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$ colors for general $k$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors for $k = 4$, both given by Kierstead in 1998. In this paper, nearly thirty years later, we have finally made progress. Our results are summarized as follows:
  (1) $k \geq 5$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $k$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{1-2/(k(k-1))})$ colors, significantly improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$
  (2) $k = 4$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $4$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{14/17})$ colors, improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors.
  (3) $k = 2$ case. We show that for randomized algorithms, the upper bound is $1.034 \log_2 n + O(1)$ colors and the lower bound is $\frac{91}{96} \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. This means that we close the gap to $1.09\mathrm{x}$.
  With our algorithm for the $k \geq 5$ case, we also obtain a deterministic online algorithm for graph coloring that achieves a competitive ratio of $O(n / \log \log n)$, which improves the best known result of $O(n \log \log \log n / \log \log n)$ by Kierstead.
  For the bipartite graph case ($k = 2$), the limit of online deterministic algorithms is known: any deterministic algorithm requires $2 \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. Our results imply that randomized algorithms can perform slightly better but still have a limit.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Provable Kemeny Constant Computation on Static and Dynamic Graphs: A 2-Forest Sampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kemeny constant, defined as the expected hitting time of random walks from a source node to a randomly chosen target node, is a fundamental metric in graph data management with many real-world applications. However, computing it exactly on large graphs is highly challenging, as it requires inverting large graph matrices. Existing solutions mainly rely on approximate random-walk-based methods, which still need large sample sizes and lack strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new approach for approximating the Kemeny constant via 2-forest sampling. We first derive an unbiased estimator expressed through spanning trees by introducing a path mapping technique that establishes a direct correspondence between spanning trees and certain classes of 2-forests. Compared to random walk-based estimators, 2-forest-based estimators yield leads to a better theoretical bound. We further design efficient algorithms to sample and traverse spanning trees, leveraging data structures such as the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) for optimization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the Kemeny constant can be approximated with relative error $\epsilon$ in $O\left(\frac{\Delta^2\bar{d}^2}{\epsilon^2}(\tau + n\min(\log n, \Delta))\right)$ time, where $\tau$ is the tree-sampling time, $\bar{d}$ is the average degree, and $\Delta$ is the graph diameter. This complexity is near-linear in practice. Moreover, existing methods largely target static graphs and lack efficient mechanisms for dynamic updates. To address this, we propose two sample maintenance strategies that partially update samples while preserving accuracy on dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 large real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both efficiency and accuracy on static and dynamic graphs.</description>

      <title>A $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the general scheduling problem in quasipolynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the general scheduling problem (GSP) which generalizes and unifies several well-studied preemptive single-machine scheduling problems, such as weighted flow time, weighted sum of completion time, and minimizing the total weight of tardy jobs. We are given a set of jobs with their processing times and release times and seek to compute a (possibly preemptive) schedule for them on one machine. Each job incurs a cost that depends on its completion time in the computed schedule, as given by a separate job-dependent cost function for each job, and our objective is to minimize the total resulting cost of all jobs. The best known result for GSP is a polynomial time $O(\log\log P)$-approximation algorithm [Bansal and Pruhs, FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014].
  We give a quasi-polynomial time $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP, assuming that the jobs' processing times are quasi-polynomially bounded integers. For the special case of the weighted tardiness objective, we even obtain an improved approximation ratio of $1+\epsilon$. For this case, no better result had been known than the mentioned $O(\log\log P)$-approximation for the general case of GSP. Our algorithms use a reduction to an auxiliary geometric covering problem. In contrast to a related reduction for the special case of weighted flow time [Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2021][Armbruster, Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2023] for GSP it seems no longer possible to establish a tree-like structure for the rectangles to guide an algorithm that solves this geometric problem. Despite the lack of structure due to the problem itself, we show that an optimal solution can be transformed into a near-optimal solution that has certain structural properties. Due to those we can guess a substantial part of the solution quickly and partition the remaining problem in an intricate way, such that we can independently solve each part recursively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a distribution related to Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) on graphs can be sampled classically in polynomial time. Graphical applications of GBS typically sample from this distribution, and thus quantum algorithms do not provide exponential speedup for these applications. We also show that another distribution related to Boson sampling can be sampled classically in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Rate-optimal community detection near the KS threshold via node-robust algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study community detection in the \emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate
  \begin{equation*}
  \exp \Bigl(-\bigl(1 \pm o(1)\bigr) \tfrac{C}{k}\Bigr),
  \quad \text{where } C = (\sqrt{pn} - \sqrt{qn})^2,
  \end{equation*}
  whenever $C \ge K\,k^2\,\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\log k$ factor.
  Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $\eta \le \exp\bigl(- (1 \pm o(1)) \tfrac{C}{k}\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.
  To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].
  In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].
  Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.
  Our work has two key technical contributions:
  (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,
  (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.</description>

      <title>Fixed-magnetization Ising on random graphs up to reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fixed-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model on random $d$-regular graphs for $d\ge 3$ and inverse temperature below the tree reconstruction threshold. Our main result is that for each magnetization $\eta$, the free energy density of the fixed-magnetization Ising model converges to the annealed free energy density, itself the Bethe free energy of an Ising measure on the infinite $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the fixed-magnetization Ising model exhibits local weak convergence to this tree measure. A key challenge to proving these results is that for magnetizations between the model's spinodal points, the limiting tree measure corresponds to an unstable fixed point of the belief propagation equations.
  As an application, we prove that the positive-temperature Zdeborov\'a--Boettcher conjecture on max-cut and min-bisection holds up to the reconstruction threshold: on the random $d$-regular graph, the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model plus the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the zero-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model equals $1+o(1)$.
  A second application is completely determining the large deviation rate function for the magnetization in the Ising model on the random regular graph up to reconstruction.
  Finally, we use the precise understanding of this rate function to show that the Glauber dynamics for the full Ising model on the random graph mixes in sub-exponential time from uniformly random initialization, well into the non-uniqueness regime where the worst-case initialization mixing time is exponentially slow.</description>

      <title>Representative set statements for delta-matroids and the Mader delta-matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present representative sets-style statements for linear delta-matroids, which are set systems that generalize matroids, with important connections to matching theory and graph embeddings. Furthermore, our proof uses a new approach of sieving polynomial families, which generalizes the linear algebra approach of the representative sets lemma to a setting of bounded-degree polynomials. The representative sets statements for linear delta-matroids then follow by analyzing the Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric matrix representing the delta-matroid. Applying the same framework to the determinant instead of the Pfaffian recovers the representative sets lemma for linear matroids. Altogether, this significantly extends the toolbox available for kernelization.
  As an application, we show an exact sparsification result for Mader networks: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and $\mathcal{T}$ a partition of a set of terminals $T \subseteq V(G)$, $|T|=k$. A $\mathcal{T}$-path in $G$ is a path with endpoints in distinct parts of $\mathcal{T}$ and internal vertices disjoint from $T$. In polynomial time, we can derive a graph $G'=(V',E')$ with $T \subseteq V(G')$, such that for every subset $S \subseteq T$ there is a packing of $\mathcal{T}$-paths with endpoints $S$ in $G$ if and only if there is one in $G'$, and $|V(G')|=O(k^3)$. This generalizes the (undirected version of the) cut-covering lemma, which corresponds to the case that $\mathcal{T}$ contains only two blocks.
  To prove the Mader network sparsification result, we furthermore define the class of Mader delta-matroids, and show that they have linear representations. This should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Random Abstract Cell Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a model for random (abstract) cell complexes (CCs), similiar to the well-known Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model for graphs and its extensions for simplicial complexes. To build a random cell complex, we first draw from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, and consecutively augment the graph with cells for each dimension with a specified probability. As the number of possible cells increases combinatorially -- e.g., 2-cells can be represented as cycles, or permutations -- we derive an approximate sampling algorithm for this model limited to two-dimensional abstract cell complexes. As a basis for this algorithm, we first introduce a spanning-tree-based method that samples simple cycles and allows the efficient approximation of various properties, most notably the probability of occurence of a given cycle. This approximation is of independent interest as it enables the approximation of a wide variety of cycle-related graph statistics using importance sampling. We use this to approximate the number of cycles of a given length on a graph, allowing us to calculate the sampling probability to arrive at a desired expected number of sampled 2-cells. The probability approximation also trivially leads to a sampling algorithm for $2$-cells with a desired sampling probability. We provide some initial analysis into the properties of random CCs drawn from this model. We further showcase practical applications for our random CCs as null models, and in the context of (random) liftings of graphs to cell complexes. The cycle sampling, cycle count estimation, and combined cell sampling algorithms are available in the package `py-raccoon` on the Python Packaging Index.</description>

      <title>Multi-variable Quantification of BDDs in External Memory using Nested Sweeping (Extended Paper)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research on the Adiar BDD package has been successful at designing algorithms capable of handling large Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) stored in external memory. To do so, it uses consecutive sweeps through the BDDs to resolve computations. Yet, this approach has kept algorithms for multi-variable quantification, the relational product, and variable reordering out of its scope.
  In this work, we address this by introducing the nested sweeping framework. Here, multiple concurrent sweeps pass information between eachother to compute the result. We have implemented the framework in Adiar and used it to create a new external memory multi-variable quantification algorithm. Compared to conventional depth-first implementations, Adiar with nested sweeping is able to solve more instances of our benchmarks and/or solve them faster.</description>

      <title>Optimal Approximations for the Requirement Cut Problem on Sparse Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Requirement Cut problem, a generalization of numerous classical graph partitioning problems including Multicut, Multiway Cut, $k$-Cut, and Steiner Multicut among others. Given a graph with edge costs, terminal groups $(S_1, ..., S_g)$ and integer requirements $(r_1,... , r_g)$; the goal is to compute a minimum-cost edge cut that separates each group $S_i$ into at least $r_i$ connected components. Despite many efforts, the best known approximation for Requirement Cut yields a double-logarithmic $O(\log(g).\log(n))$ approximation ratio as it relies on embedding general graphs into trees and solving the tree instance.
  In this paper, we explore two largely unstudied structural parameters in order to obtain single-logarithmic approximation ratios: (1) the number of minimal Steiner trees in the instance, which in particular is upper-bounded by the number of spanning trees of the graphs multiplied by $g$, and (2) the depth of series-parallel graphs. Specifically, we show that if the number of minimal Steiner trees is polynomial in $n$, then a simple LP-rounding algorithm yields an $O(\log n)$-approximation, and if the graph is series-parallel with a constant depth then a refined analysis of a known probabilistic embedding yields a $O(depth.\log(g))$-approximation on series-parallel graphs of bounded depth. Both results extend the known class of graphs that have a single-logarithmic approximation ratio.</description>

      <title>Renaming in distributed certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local certification is the area of distributed network computing asking the following question: How to certify to the nodes of a network that a global property holds, if they are limited to a local verification?
  In this area, it is often essential to have identifiers, that is, unique integers assigned to the nodes. In this short paper, we show how to reduce the range of the identifiers, in three different settings. More precisely, we show how to rename identifiers in the classical local certification setting, when we can (resp.\ cannot) choose the new identifiers, and we show how a global certificate can help to encode very compactly a new identifier assignment that is not injective in general, but still useful in applications.
  We conclude with a number of applications of these results: For every $\ell$, there are local certification schemes for the properties of having clique number at most $\ell$, having diameter at most $\ell$, and having independence number at most~2, with certificates of size $O(n)$. We also show that there is a global certification scheme for bipartiteness with a certificate of size $O(n)$. All these results are optimal.</description>

      <title>Linear-Space Extragradient Methods for Fast, Large-Scale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and its entropy-regularized form (EOT) have become increasingly prominent computational problems, with applications in machine learning and statistics. Recent years have seen a commensurate surge in first-order methods aiming to improve the complexity of large-scale (E)OT. However, there has been a consistent tradeoff: attaining state-of-the-art rates requires $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage to enable ergodic primal averaging. In this work, we demonstrate that recently proposed primal-dual extragradient methods (PDXG) can be implemented entirely in the dual with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ storage. Additionally, we prove that regularizing the reformulated OT problem is equivalent to EOT with extensions to entropy-regularized barycenter problems, further widening the applications of the proposed method. The proposed dual-only extragradient method (DXG) achieves $\mathcal{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity for $\varepsilon$-approximate OT with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the dual extragradient method scales favorably in non/weakly-regularized regimes compared to existing algorithms, though future work is needed to improve performance in certain problem classes.</description>
