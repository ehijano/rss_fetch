      <title>Kuramoto model with stochastic resetting and coupling through an external medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most studies of collective phenomena in oscillator networks focus on directly coupled systems as exemplified by the classical Kuramoto model. However, there are growing number of examples in which oscillators interact indirectly via a common external medium, including bacterial quorum sensing (QS) networks, pedestrians walking on a bridge, and centrally coupled lasers. In this paper we analyze the effects of stochastic phase resetting on a Kuramoto model with indirect coupling. All the phases are simultaneously reset to their initial values at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process. On the other hand, the external environmental state is not reset. We first derive a continuity equation for the population density in the presence of resetting and show how the resulting density equation is itself subject to stochastic resetting. We then use an Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz to reduce the infinite-dimensional system to a four-dimensional piecewise deterministic system with subsystem resetting. The latter is used to explore how synchronization depends on a cell density parameter. (In bacterial QS this represents the ratio of the population cell volume and the extracellular volume.) At high densities we recover the OA dynamics of the classical Kuramoto model with global resetting. On the other hand, at low densities, we show how subsystem resetting has a major effect on collective synchronization, ranging from noise-induced transitions to slow/fast dynamics.</description>

      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimps reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena, and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthfully functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes, since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes may lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EAD and DAD, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired spikes. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DAD usually comes with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimps -- isoperiodic structures of the parameter space. However, in our system, the shrimps have an internal structure made of multiple periodicities, revealing a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could come in handy to unveil the features of heart myocytes behavior that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>A Swarm Coherence Mechanism for Jellyfish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of jellyfish swarm formation and exemplify it with simulations of active Brownian particles. The motivation for our analysis is the phenomenon of jellyfish blooms in the ocean and clustering of jellyfish in tank experiments. We argue that such clusters emerge due to an externally induced phase transition of jellyfish density, such as convergent flows, which is then maintained and amplified by self-induced stimuli. Our study introduces three mechanisms relevant for a better understanding of jellyfish blooming that have not been taken into account before which are a signaling tracer, jellyfish-wall interaction and ignorance of external stimuli. Our results agree with the biological fact that jellyfish exhibit an extreme sensitivity to stimuli in order to achieve favorable aggregations. Based on our theoretical framework, we are able to provide a clear terminology for future experimental analysis of jellyfish swarming and we pinpoint potential limitations of tank experiments.</description>

      <title>An exact solution for a non-autonomous delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution for a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation (DDE) over the entire real-time axis, representing it as a sum of Gaussian-shaped dynamics with distinct peak positions. This marks the first explicit solution for non-autonomous DDEs and is a rare example even among general DDEs. The constructed solution offers key physical insights and facilitates the analysis of system properties, such as the envelope profile of the dynamics.</description>
