      <title>Boolean Functions with Small Approximate Spectral Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is called the spectral norm of $f$. Green and Sanders' quantitative version of Cohen's idempotent theorem states that if the spectral norm of $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{0,1\}$ is at most $M$, then the support of $f$ belongs to the ring of sets generated by at most $\ell(M)$ cosets, where $\ell(M)$ is a constant that only depends on $M$.
  We prove that the above statement can be generalized to \emph{approximate} spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition. In particular, our theorem provides a new proof of the quantitative Cohen's theorem for $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.</description>

      <title>Conflict-free chromatic index of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable if there exists an assignment of $k$ colors to $E(G)$ such that for every edge $e\in E(G)$, there is a color that is assigned to exactly one edge among the closed neighborhood of $e$. The smallest $k$ such that $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable is called the conflict-free chromatic index of $G$, denoted $\chi'_{CF}(G)$. D\c{e}bski and Przyby\a{l}o showed that $2\le\chi'_{CF}(T)\le 3$ for every tree $T$ of size at least two. In this paper, we present an algorithm to determine that the conflict-free chromatic index of a tree without 2-degree vertices is 2 or 3, in time $O(n^3)$. This partially answer a question raised by D\c{e}bski and Przyby\a{l}o.</description>

      <title>About almost covering subsets of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>

      <title>A Tie-breaking based Local Search Algorithm for Stable Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stable marriage problem with incomplete lists and ties (SMTI) and the hospitals/residents problem with ties (HRT) are important in matching theory with broad practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a tie-breaking based local search algorithm (TBLS) designed to achieve a weakly stable matching of maximum size for both the SMTI and HRT problems. TBLS begins by arbitrarily resolving all ties and iteratively refines the tie-breaking strategy by adjusting the relative order within ties based on preference ranks and the current stable matching. Additionally, we introduce TBLS-E, an equity-focused variant of TBLS, specifically designed for the SMTI problem. This variant maintains the objective of maximizing matching size, while enhancing equity through two simple modifications. In comparison with ten other approximation and local search algorithms, TBLS achieves the highest matching size, while TBLS-E exhibits the lowest sex equality cost. Significantly, TBLS-E preserves a matching size comparable to that of TBLS. Both our algorithms demonstrate faster computational speed than other local search algorithms in solving large-sized instances.</description>

      <title>Mixed-integer linear programming approaches for nested $p$-center problems with absolute and relative regret objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the nested $p$-center problem, which is a multi-period variant of the well-known $p$-center problem. The use of the nesting concept allows to obtain solutions, which are consistent over the considered time horizon, i.e., facilities which are opened in a given time period stay open for subsequent time periods. This is important in real-life applications, as closing (and potential later re-opening) of facilities between time periods can be undesirable.
  We consider two different versions of our problem, with the difference being the objective function. The first version considers the sum of the absolute regrets (of nesting) over all time periods, and the second version considers minimizing the maximum relative regret over the time periods.
  We present three mixed-integer programming formulations for the version with absolute regret objective and two formulations for the version with relative regret objective. For all the formulations, we present valid inequalities. Based on the formulations and the valid inequalities, we develop branch-and-bound/branch-and-cut solution algorithms. These algorithms include a preprocessing procedure that exploits the nesting property and also begins heuristics and primal heuristics.
  We conducted a computational study on instances from the literature for the $p$-center problem, which we adapted to our problems. We also analyse the effect of nesting on the solution cost and the number of open facilities.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite programming and linear equations vs. homomorphism problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a relaxation for homomorphism problems that combines semidefinite programming with linear Diophantine equations, and propose a framework for the analysis of its power based on the spectral theory of association schemes. We use this framework to establish an unconditional lower bound against the semidefinite programming + linear equations model, by showing that the relaxation does not solve the approximate graph homomorphism problem and thus, in particular, the approximate graph colouring problem.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>
