      <title>Emulating isomerization with two-dimensional Coulomb crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isomerization, i.e. the rearrangement between distinct molecular configurations, is a fundamental process in chemistry. Here we demonstrate that two-dimensional Coulomb crystals can emulate molecular isomerization and be used to characterize its physical mechanisms. In our molecular analogue, the confining potential acts as an electronic orbital, which can be tuned continuously and dynamically. We use a planar crystal of six 138Ba+ ions, which exhibits two stable configurations depending on the aspect ratio of the harmonic trapping potential. By changing this aspect ratio, we directly modify the potential energy surface (PES) of the ion crystal, and trigger isomerization in a controlled way. We identify a region of bistability between the two isomers, and use configuration-resolved imaging to detect isomerization in real time. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the double well PES. By comparing simulated transition rates with experimental population ratios, we estimate the crystal's temperature. Additionally, we prepare metastable configurations by rapidly quenching the PES, and detect isomerization dynamics with sub-millisecond resolution. Our work establishes a new platform for emulating molecular processes, paving the way for studying quantum superpositions of crystal configurations, and for controlling isomeric excitations in two-dimensional Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and nonequilibrium dynamics on a Lieb lattice of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators offer a promising approach to the exploration of strongly interacting many-body systems, with applications spanning condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. Through a combination of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Planckian bound on IR/UV mixing from cold-atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IR/UV mixing (a mechanism causing ultraviolet quantum-gravity effects to manifest themselves also in a far-infrared regime) is a rare case of feature found in several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem. We here derive the implications for "soft" IR/UV mixing (corrections to the dispersion relation that are linear in momentum) of some recent cold-atom-interferometry measurements. For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish bounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length milestone. Intriguingly, for values of the characteristic scale of about half the Planck length we find that IR/UV mixing provides a solution for a puzzling discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric measurements of the fine structure constant.</description>

      <title>Improving the atomic modelling for solar UV radiative transfer calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations have been produced over the years for many lines and continua in the UV wavelength range of solar and cool stellar atmospheres for a variety of conditions. Despite significant improvements in computing power and availability of atomic data over time, atomic models are often still limited in size and rely on approximations for data. There have also been inconsistencies in the way photo-ionisation and radiative recombination have been treated. Here, we incorporate into the Lightweaver radiative transfer code new data and updated modelling of atomic processes for the low charge states of C, Si and S. Data are taken from the CHIANTI database and other widely-available sources for the relevant elements. We show the significant impact this has on the UV continua in the 1100-1700{\AA} region, especially for Si. The results are in much better agreement with averaged, quiet Sun observations, and remove the need to invoke "missing opacity" to resolve discrepancies. The present treatment has important implications for radiative transfer calculations and the model atmospheres used as inputs.</description>

      <title>Fate of an impurity strongly interacting with a thermal Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We spectroscopically study mobile impurities immersed in a homogeneous bosonic bath (a box-trapped Bose gas), varying the bath temperature and the strength of impurity-bath interactions. We compare our results to those for a quasipure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and find that for strong impurity-bath interactions, the spectra narrow with increasing temperature, while the impurity energy shift is suppressed. Near the critical temperature for condensation, many-body effects still play an important role, and only for a nondegenerate bath, the system approaches the classical Boltzmann-gas behavior. The key spectral features are reproduced within the theory of an ideal Bose polaron.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling for trapped-ion thermometry using dark resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of vibrational energy transport and quantum thermodynamics with trapped ions requires good methods for the estimation of temperatures. One valuable tool for this purpose is based on the fit of dark resonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, this fit demands numerical simulations of the coupled electronic-motional dynamics which usually involve a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified dynamical equations for the simulation of the spectrum of a trapped ion that undergoes thermal motion, identifying the advantages and limitations of each method. We start with a three-level model to provide a better insight into the approximations involved, and then move on to tackle the experimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that mimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is computationally very convenient, but can lead to significant errors in the estimation of the temperature. Nevertheless, this can be counteracted by a proper calibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of transition matrix elements in cadmium for vacuum-ultraviolet generation in $^{229}$Th nuclear clock applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relativistic Fock-space coupled-cluster methods are applied to the cadmium atom. A large number of transition energies and matrix elements are calculated for the $5s^{2}\:$$ ^{1}S \to 5snp\: ^{1,3} P^{o}$, $5s6s\: ^{1}S \to 5snp\: ^{1,3} P^{o}$ and $5s5d\: ^{1}D \to 5snp\: ^{1,3} P^{o}$ transitions for a wide range of $p$ states accounting for relativistic and electron-correlation effects. The results obtained within two different approaches (Fock-space coupled cluster and configuration interaction) are compared with available experimental and theoretical data. Good agreement is found between the two methods for transitions involving low-lying excited $p$-states, whereas for high-lying states, the discrepancy becomes large. The calculated values are used to determine the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of cadmium vapor, with an agreement within 5\% between the different methods. The results of the present computations support the feasibility of generating vacuum ultraviolet light in Cd vapor via a four-wave mixing process for the spectroscopy of $^{229}$Th isomer transition.</description>

      <title>Integration of a high-fidelity model of quantum sensors with a map-matching filter for quantum-enhanced navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the potential of quantum sensors to assist in navigation requires enabling their operation in complex, dynamic environments and integrating them within existing navigation systems. While cross-couplings from platform dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data. In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that could support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond navigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to current research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters, gradiometers and inertial sensors.</description>
