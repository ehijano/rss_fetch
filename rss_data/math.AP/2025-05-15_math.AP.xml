      <title>Monotonicity of the Laplace Transform for dissipative systems: Magnetic Induction Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT) is a proven technique for looking inside conductive materials, using low-frequency electromagnetic fields. However, analyzing MIT data is mathematically complex because of the non-linear and ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. In this framework, the Monotonicity Principle is recognized as an effective approach to solve the inverse obstacle problem in realistic situations and real-time operations.
  To date, the Monotonicity Principle has been found for elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs, even in the presence of nonlinearities. Magnetic Induction Tomography is modeled by a parabolic PDE. The physics of this dissipative system pose severe challenges from the theoretical and applied perspectives. To date, the Monotonicity Principles for MIT have been found only for proper asymptotic approximations or source-free problems.
  This article recognizes that the operator mapping the Laplace transform of the applied source onto the measured quantity (Transfer Operator) satisfies a Monotonicity Principle on a real semi-axis of the complex plane. Therefore, this article introduces the concept of transfer operator in Magnetic Induction Tomography, proves a Monotonicity Principle for the transfer operator evaluated on a proper real semi-axis of the complex plane, and provides a description of the related (real-time) imaging method.</description>

      <title>Minimizers and best constants for a weighted critical Sobolev inequality involving the polyharmonic operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main goal is to explicitly compute the best constant for the Sobolev-type inequality involving the polyharmonic operator obtained in (Analysis and Applications 22, pp. 1417-1446, 2024). To achieve this goal, we also establish both regularity and classification results for a generalized critical polyharmonic equation in the radial setting.</description>

      <title>On the expansion of a wedge of van der Waals gas into vacuum III: interaction of fan-shock-fan composite waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the expansion into vacuum of a wedge of gas at rest. This problem catches several important classes of wave interactions in the context of 2D Riemann problems. When the gas at rest is a nonideal gas, the gas away from the sharp corner of the wedge may expand into the vacuum as two symmetrical planar rarefaction fan waves, shock-fan composite waves, or fan-shock-fan composite waves. Then the expansion in vacuum problem can be reduced to the interactions of these elementary waves. Global existences of classical solutions to the interaction of the fan waves and the interaction of the shock-fan composite waves were obtained by the author in [21,22]. In the present paper we study the third case: interaction of fan-shock-fan composite waves. In contrast to the first two cases, the third case involves shock waves in the interaction region and is actually a shock free boundary problem. Differing from the transonic shock free boundary problems arising in 2D Riemann problems for ideal gases, the type of the shocks for this shock free boundary problem is also a priori unknown. This results in the fact that the formulation of the boundary conditions on the shocks is also a priori unknown. By calculating the curvatures of the shocks and using the Liu's extended entropy condition, we prove that the shocks in the interaction region must be post-sonic (in the sense of the flow velocity relative to the shock front). We also prove that the shocks are envelopes of one out of the two families of wave characteristics of the flow behind them, and not characteristics. By virtue of the hodograph transformation method and the characteristic decomposition method, we construct a global-in-time piecewise smooth solution to the expansion in vacuum problem for the third case.</description>

Abstract: Blowing-up solutions for semi-linear Klein-Gordon equations are considered in Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Some sufficient conditions are shown by applying the concavity method for semi-linear wave equations in the Minkowski spacetime to semi-linear Klein-Gordon equations in FLRW spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation phenomena in nonlinear hierarchical neural networks with predictive coding feedback dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework to systematically explore the propagation properties of a class of continuous in time nonlinear neural network models comprising a hierarchy of processing areas, mutually connected according to the principles of predictive coding. We precisely determine the conditions under which upward propagation, downward propagation or even propagation failure can occur in both bi-infinite and semi-infinite idealizations of the model. We also study the long-time behavior of the system when either a fixed external input is constantly presented at the first layer of the network or when this external input consists in the presentation of constant input with large amplitude for a fixed time window followed by a reset to a down state of the network for all later times. In both cases, we numerically demonstrate the existence of threshold behavior for the amplitude of the external input characterizing whether or not a full propagation within the network can occur. Our theoretical results are consistent with predictive coding theories and allow us to identify regions of parameters that could be associated with dysfunctional perceptions.</description>

      <title>Injectivity of boundary integral operator in direct-indirect mixed Burton-Miller equation for wave scattering problems with transmissive circular inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proves that the injectivity condition for the integral operator of the direct-indirect mixed Burton-Miller (BM) boundary integral equation (BIE) for Helmholtz transmission problems is identical to that for the ordinary BM BIE for Helmholtz transmission problems with a transmissive circular inclusion. Although some numerical methods based on the direct-indirect mixed BM BIE can be computed faster than the ordinary BM BIE, its well-posedness has been unclear. This study resolves a part of the well-posedness, namely the injectivity of the integral operator with a transmissive circular inclusion.</description>

      <title>The Kramers-Fokker-Planck equation with a decaying potential in $\mathbb R^n$, $n \ge 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use methods from microlocal analysis and quantum scattering to study spectral properties near the threshold zero of the Kramers-Fokker-Planck operator with a decaying potential in $\mathbb R^n$, $n \ge 4$, and deduce the large-time behavior of solutions to the kinetic Kramers-Fokker-Planck equation. For short-range potentials, we establish an optimal time-decay estimate in weighted $L^2$-spaces when $ n\ge 5$ is odd. For potentials decaying like $O(|x|^{-\rho})$ for some $\rho &gt; n-1$, we obtain, for all dimensions $n \ge 4$, a large-time expansion of the solution with the leading term given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution multiplied by the factor $(4\pi t)^{-\frac n 2}$ corresponding to the decay for the heat equation. These results complete those obtained in [16, 22] for dimensions $n=1$ and $3$. The same questions for $n=2$ are still open.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the modified Whitham equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to show global existence and modified scattering for the solutions of the Cauchy problem to the modified Whitham equations for small, smooth and localized initial data. The main difficulties come from slow decay and non-homogeneity of the Fourier multiplier $(\sqrt{\tanh \xi/\xi})\xi$, which will be overcome by introducing an interaction multiplier theorem and estimating the weighted norms in the frequency space. When estimating the weighted norms, due to loss of derivatives, the energy estimate will be performed in the frequency space, and the absence of time resonance will be effectively utilized by extracting some good terms arising from integration by parts in time before the energy estimate.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the magnetic lines of large solutions to the Magnetohydrodynamic equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is twofold: first, we introduce a new class of global strong solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic system in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with initial data $(u_0,b_0)$ of arbitrarily large size in any critical space. To do so, we impose a smallness condition on the difference $u_0-b_0$. Then we use this result to prove magnetic reconnection for a suitable class of (large) solutions. With this, we mean a change of topology of the integral lines of the magnetic field $b$ under the evolution. The proof relies on counting the number of hyperbolic critical points of the solutions, and this instance is structurally stable.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness for non-autonomous parabolic Cauchy problems with rough initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a complete picture for existence, uniqueness, and representation of weak solutions to non-autonomous parabolic Cauchy problems of divergence type. The coefficients are only assumed to be uniformly elliptic, bounded, measurable, and complex-valued, without any additional regularity or symmetry conditions. The initial data are tempered distributions taken in homogeneous Hardy--Sobolev spaces $\dot{H}^{s,p}$, and source terms belong to certain scales of weighted tent spaces. Weak solutions are constructed with their gradients in weighted tent spaces $T^{p}_{s/2}$. Analogous results are also exhibited for initial data in homogeneous Besov spaces $\dot{B}^{s}_{p,p}$.</description>

      <title>A direct imaging method for inverse scattering problem of biharmonic wave with phased and phaseless data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse biharmonic scattering problems of identifying the shape and location of the obstacle with phased and phaseless measurement data. A direct imaging method based on reverse time migration is proposed for reconstructing the extended obstacle with one of four types of boundary conditions on the obstacle. The newly developed imaging functions are constructed by utilizing merely one of various measurement data, including the scattered field, its normal derivative, the bending moment, the transverse force, its far-field and the phaseless total field. Our resolution analysis demonstrates that these imaging functions have a contrast when sampling points are near or far from the boundary of the obstacle. Numerical experiments are further presented to show the algorithm's efficiency to accurately reconstruct complex scatter geometries and its robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>Convolution estimates for the Boltzmann gain operator with hard spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new moment-preserving weighted $L^p$ convolution estimates for the gain operator of the Boltzmann equation with hard potentials. In the case of hard spheres, our bounds are valid in $L^p$ for $3.89 \leq p \leq \infty$. The proof relies crucially on a novel collisional averaging mechanism to handle pathological collisions accumulating energy to one particle, and uses purely kinetic tools. As an application of these estimates we construct global strong solutions to the classical and quantum Boltzmann equations with hard sphere cross-section. We also show that some $L^p$ moments are propagated by the flow.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Approach via Global Relaxation to the Variational Modelling of Hierarchical Structured Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of many materials to applied forces and boundary constraints depends upon internal geometric changes at multiple submacroscopic levels. Hierarchical structured deformations provide a mathematical setting for the description of such changes and for the variational determination of the corresponding energetic response. The research in this article provides substantial refinements and broadenings of the mathematical setting both for the underlying geometrical structure and for the variational analysis of energetic response. The mathematical tools employed in this research include the global method for relaxation and establish the equivalence of a relaxed energy obtained via relaxation under simultaneous geometrical changes at all levels and a relaxed energy obtained via iterated relaxations proceeding from the deepest submacroscopic level successively to the macroscopic level.</description>

Abstract: We prove bilinear $\ell^2$-decoupling and refined bilinear decoupling inequalities for the truncated hyperbolic paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^3$. As an application, we prove the associated restriction estimate in the range $p&gt;22/7$, matching an earlier result for the elliptic paraboloid.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions to 4D quasilinear wave equations with short pulse initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global existence of smooth solutions to general 4D quasilinear wave equations satisfying the first null condition with the short pulse initial data. Although the global existence of small data solutions to 4D quasilinear wave equations holds true without any requirement of null conditions, yet for short pulse data, in general, it is sufficient and necessary to require the fulfillment of the first null condition to have global smooth solutions. It is noted that short pulse data are extensions of a class of spherically symmetric data, for which the smallness restrictions are imposed on angular directions and along the outgoing directional derivative $\partial_t+\partial_r$, but the largeness is kept for the incoming directional derivative $\partial_t-\partial_r$. We expect that here methods can be applied to study the global smooth solution or blowup problem with short pulse initial data for the general 2D and 3D quasilinear wave equations when the corresponding null conditions hold or not. On the other hand, as some direct applications of our main results, one can show that for the short pulse initial data, the smooth solutions to the 4D irrotational compressible Euler equations for Chaplygin gases, 4D nonlinear membrane equations and 4D relativistic membrane equations exist globally since their nonlinearities satisfy the first null condition; while the smooth solutions to the 4D irrotational compressible Euler equations for polytropic gases generally blow up in finite time since the corresponding first null condition does not hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an existence result for globally continuous weak solutions to elliptic equations of the $p$-Poisson type. This result significantly improves Theorem 8.30 in Gilbarg-Trudinger (1983) and offers a novel contribution for the classical Poisson equation on Lipschitz domains, ensuring global H\"{o}lder continuity of solutions under a minimal assumption on the right-hand side. Applications of this result to embedding theorems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the bacterial run-and-tumble kinetic model : quantitative and strong convergence results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the past century, biologists and mathematicians investigated two mechanisms underlying bacteria motion: the run phase during which bacteria move in straight lines and the tumble phase in which they change their orientation. When surrounded by a chemical attractant, experiments show that bacteria increase their run time as moving up concentration gradients, leading to a biased random walk towards favorable regions. This observation raises the following question, which has drawn intense interest from both biological and mathematical communities: what cellular mechanisms enable bacteria to feel concentration gradients ? In this article, we investigate an asymptotic regime that was proposed to explain this ability thanks to internal mechanisms. More precisely, we derive the run-and-tumble kinetic equation with concentration's gradient dependent tumbling rate from a more comprehensive model, which incorporates internal cellular mechanisms. Our result improves on previous investigations, as we obtain strong convergence towards the gradient dependent kinetic model with quantitative and formally optimal convergence rates. The main ingredient consists in identifying a set of coordinates for the internal cellular dynamics in which concentration gradients arise explicitly. Then, we use relative entropy methods in order to capture quantitative measurement of the distance between the model incorporating cellular mechanisms and the one with concentration gradient dependent tumbling rate.</description>

      <title>Critical, stability and higher-order analysis for Hardy type inequalities on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on three main objectives related to Hardy-type inequalities on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. Firstly, we explore critical Hardy-type inequalities that contain logarithmic terms, highlighting their significance. Secondly, we examine the stability of both critical and subcritical cases of the Hardy inequality. Lastly, we establish two weighted Hardy-type inequalities where singularities appear at the origin as well as boundary and we discuss their implications for higher-order operators. Our results improve upon previous findings and also present new higher-order versions of these inequalities as additional outcomes.</description>

      <title>Strong well-posedness and separation properties for a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard system with singular potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-posedness of a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with singular potentials. For this model, we first prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution by approximating the singular potentials via a Yosida regularization, applying the corresponding results for regular potentials, and eventually passing to the limit in this approximation scheme. Then, we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions and their continuous dependence on the velocity fields and the initial data. Afterwards, assuming additional regularity of the domain as well as the velocity fields, we establish higher regularity properties of weak solutions and eventually the existence of strong solutions. In the end, we discuss strict separation properties for logarithmic type potentials in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>On reconstruction from imaginary part for radiation solutions in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a radiation solution $\psi$ for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^2$. We show that $\psi$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by its imaginary part $Im(\psi)$ on an interval of a line $L$ lying in the exterior region. This result has holographic prototype in the recent work Nair, Novikov (2025, J. Geom. Anal. 35, 123). Some other curves for measurements instead of the lines $L$ are also considered. Applications to the Gelfand-Krein-Levitan inverse problem (from boundary values of the spectral measure in $\mathbb R^2$) and to passive imaging are also indicated.</description>

      <title>A Nash-Kuiper theorem for isometric immersions beyond Borisov's exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any short immersion from an $n$-dimensional bounded and simply connected domain into $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and any H\"older exponent $\alpha&lt;(1+n^2-n)^{-1}$, we construct a $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersion arbitrarily close in the $C^0$ topology. This extends the classical Nash--Kuiper theorem and shows the flexibility of $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersions beyond Borisov's exponent. In particular, for $n=2$, the regularity threshold aligns with the Onsager exponent $1/3$ for the incompressible Euler equations. Our proof relies on three novelties that allow for the cancellation of leading-order error terms in the convex integration scheme: a new corrugation ansatz, an integration by parts procedure, and an adapted algebraic decomposition of these errors.</description>

      <title>A dimension-free discrete Remez-type inequality on the polytorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider $f:\Omega^n_K \to \mathbf{C}$ a function from the $n$-fold product of multiplicative cyclic groups of order $K$. Any such $f$ may be extended via its Fourier expansion to an analytic polynomial on the polytorus $\mathbf{T}^n$, and the set of such polynomials coincides with the set of all analytic polynomials on $\mathbf{T}^n$ of individual degree at most $K-1$.
  In this setting it is natural to ask how the supremum norms of $f$ over $\mathbf{T}^n$ and over $\Omega_K^n$ compare. We prove the following \emph{discretization of the uniform norm} for low-degree polynomials: if $f$ has degree at most $d$ as an analytic polynomial, then $\|f\|_{\mathbf{T}^n}\leq C(d,K)\|f\|_{\Omega_K^n}$ with $C(d,K)$ independent of dimension $n$. As a consequence we also obtain a new proof of the Bohnenblust--Hille inequality for functions on products of cyclic groups.
  Key to our argument is a special class of Fourier multipliers on $\Omega_K^n$ which are $L^\infty\to L^\infty$ bounded independent of dimension when restricted to low-degree polynomials. This class includes projections onto the $k$-homogeneous parts of low-degree polynomials as well as projections of much finer granularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler equations on mildly singular K\"ahler varieties. Assuming the existence of a suitable resolution of singularities, we establish the existence of singular weighted cscK metrics when the weighted Mabuchi functional is coercive for an extremal weight. This extends the works of Chen-Cheng and He to the singular weighted setting. Moreover, we provide a method for constructing examples of singular cscK metrics inspired by the work of Arezzo--Pacard. In contrast to the usual gluing techniques, our approach does not require a precise understanding about of the metric behavior near the singular locus.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling-invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>
