      <title>The Information Theory of Self-Organization Phenomena in Thermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits Brownian motion from the perspective of Information Theory, aiming to explore the connections between Information Theory, Thermodynamics, and Complex Science. First, we propose a single-particle discrete Brownian motion model (SPBM). Within the framework of the maximum entropy principle and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the equivalence of prior information and constraint conditions, revealing the relationship between local randomness and global probability distribution. By analyzing particle motion, we find that local constraints and randomness can lead to global probability distributions, thereby reflecting the interplay between local and global dynamics in the process of information transfer. Next, we extend our research to multi-particle systems, introducing the concepts of "Energy as Encoding" and "Information Temperature" to clarify how energy distribution determines information structure. We explore how energy, as not only a fundamental physical quantity in physical systems but also an inherently informational one, directly dictates the prior probability distribution of system states, thus serving as a form of information encoding. Based on this, we introduce the concept of "Equilibrium Flow" to explain the self-organizing behavior of systems under energy constraints and Negative Information Temperature. By proving three theorems regarding Equilibrium Flow systems, we reveal the criticality of Self-Organization, energy-information conversion efficiency, and the characteristic that event occurrence probabilities follow the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Through theoretical analysis and theorem proofs, we offer new perspectives for understanding the dynamics of Complex Systems, enriching the theoretical framework of Information Theory, Thermodynamics, and Complex Science, and providing a new theoretical basis for further research in related fields.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and crystal melting of helium-4 in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of two-dimensional helium-4 using neural quantum states. Our variational description allows us to address liquid and solid phases using the same functional form as well as exploring possible melting scenarios, for instance via an intermediate hexatic phase. Notably, this is achieved by performing fixed pressure variational Monte Carlo calculations. Within the isobaric ensemble framework, we are able to clearly identify the first-order liquid-solid phase transition. However, in an intermediate region of nearly constant pressure, we find that simulations of $N=30$ atoms continuously transition from liquid to solid, with signatures of a hexatic order coexisting with a small condensate fraction. Calculations for larger systems follow the metastable liquid and solid branches in this transient region. We additionally compute the R\'enyi-2 entanglement entropy across the liquid-solid phase transition and find a sharp decrease upon freezing.</description>

      <title>A new special function related to a discrete Gauss-Poisson distribution and some physics of the cell model with Curie-Weiss interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by previous studies in statistical physics [see, in particular, Kozitsky at al., A phase transition in a Curie-Weiss system with binary interactions, Condens. Matter Phys. 23, 23502 (2020)] we introduce a discrete Gauss-Poisson probability distribution function \begin{equation}\label{GPD}\tag{A1} p_{GP}(n ;z,r)=\left[R(r;z)\right]^{-1}\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2} \end{equation} with support on $\mathbb N_0$ and parameters $z\in\mathbb R$ and $r\in\mathbb R_+$. The probability mass function $p_{GP}(n ;z,r)$ is normalized by the special function $R(r;z)$, given by the infinite sum \begin{equation}\label{R}\tag{A2} R(r;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2}, \end{equation} possessing extremely intersting mathematical properties. We present an asymptotic estimate $R^{(\rm as)}(r;z\gg1)$ for the function $R(r;z)$ with large arguments $z$, along with similar formulas for its logarithm and logarithmic derivative. These functions exhibit very interesting oscillatory behavior around their asymptotics, for parameters $r$ above some threshold value $r^*$. Some implications of our findings are discussed in the context of the Curie-Weiss cell model of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Theory for kq-Deformed Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive quantum many body theory for kq deformed particles, offering a novel framework that relates particle statistics directly to effective interaction strength. Deformed by the parameters k and q, these particles exhibit statistical behaviors that interpolate between conventional bosonic and fermionic systems, enabling us to model complex interactions via statistical modifications. We develop a generalized Wick's theorem and extended Feynman diagrammatic tailored to kq-particles, allowing us to calculate two types of Green functions. Explicit expressions for these Green functions are derived in both direct and momentum spaces, providing key insights into the collective properties of kq-deformed systems. Using a random phase approximation (RPA), we estimate the dielectric function for q-fermion gas, and analyze the Friedel oscillations, the plasmon excitations, and the energy loss function. Our results demonstrate that the effective interaction is tuned by the value of q, so that a non interacting limit is obtained as q goes to zero, where the Friedel as well as the plasma oscillations disappear. There is an optimal value of q, the plasma frequency, as well as the energy loss function show an absolute maximum, and the effective interaction changes behavior.</description>

      <title>Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces a variety of open quantum phenomena that have no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators within the 38-fold way, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as anomalous boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, constituting the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Crossover Finite-Size Scaling Theory and Its Applications in Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-size scaling (FSS) for a critical phase transition ($t=0$) states that within a window of size $|t|\sim L^{-1/\nu}$, the scaling behavior of any observable $Q$ in a system of linear size $L$ asymptotically follows a scaling form as $Q(t,L)=L^{Y_Q}\tilde{Q}(tL^{1/\nu})$, where $\nu$ is the correlation-length exponent, $Y_Q$ is an FSS exponent and ${\tilde Q}(x)$ is a function of the scaled distance-to-criticality $x \equiv tL^{1/\nu}$. We systematically study the asymptotic scaling behavior of ${\tilde Q}(|x|\to\infty)$ for a broad variety of observables by requiring that the FSS and infinite-system critical behaviors match with each other in the crossover critical regime with $t \to 0$ and $|x|\to\infty$. This crossover FSS theory predicts that when the criticality is approached at a slower speed as $|t|\sim L^{-\lambda}$ with $\lambda &lt;1/\nu$, the FSS becomes $\lambda$-dependent and the exponent can be derived. As applications, explosive percolation and high-dimensional percolation are considered. For the former, it is shown that the widely observed anomalous phenomena at the infinite-system criticality $t=0$ can be attributed to the mixing effects of the standard FSS behaviors around the pseudocritical point in an event-based ensemble. For the latter, FSS exponents are found to be different at the infinite-system critical and the pseudocritical point if free boundary conditions are used, and they are related to each other by using the crossover FSS theory. From these observations, the FSS of percolation systems falls into three classifications. Extensive simulations are carried out to affirm these predictions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy for a type of scale-invariant states in two spatial dimensions and beyond: universal finite-size scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic scheme is proposed to investigate the entanglement entropy for a type of scale-invariant states, valid for orthonormal basis states in the ground state subspace of quantum many-body systems undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in two spatial dimensions and beyond. It is argued that a contribution from the area law to the entanglement entropy is absent, since the closeness to the boundary between a subsystem and its environment is not well-defined, given that a permutation symmetry group with respect to the unit cells of degenerate ground state wave functions emerges. Three physical constraints imposed lead to a universal finite-system size scaling function in the dominant logarithmic contribution to the entanglement entropy. As a result, an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace is revealed, characterized by the fractal dimension. The latter in turn is identical to the number of type-B Goldstone modes for the orthonormal basis states. The prediction is numerically confirmed for the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$s$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the ${\rm SU}(2s+1)$ ferromagnetic model, and the staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model.</description>

      <title>Measurments-induced quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions induced by local projective measurements have attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. It has been in particular argued that measurements may induce an abrupt change in the scaling law of the bipartite entanglement entropy. In this work we show that local projective measurements on a one-dimensional quadratic fermionic system induce a qualitative modification of the time growth of the entanglement entropy, changing from linear to logarithmic. However, in the stationary regime, the logarithmic behavior of the entanglement entropy does not survive in the thermodynamic limit and, for any finite value of the measurement rate, we numerically show the existence of a single area-law phase for the entanglement entropy. We give analytical arguments supporting our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of Deception in Asset-Exchange Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transient and steady-state dynamics of the Bennati-Dregulescu-Yakovenko money game in the presence of probabilistic cheaters, who can misrepresent their financial status by claiming to have no money. We derive the steady-state wealth distribution per player analytically and show how the presence of hidden cheaters can be inferred from the relative variance of wealth per player. In scenarios with a finite number of cheaters amidst an infinite pool of honest players, we identify a critical probability of cheating at which the total wealth owned by the cheaters experiences a second-order discontinuity. Below this point, the probability to lose money is larger than the probability to gain; conversely, above this point, the direction is reversed. Additionally, we establish a threshold probability at which cheaters collectively possess more than half of the total wealth in the game. Lastly, we provide bounds on the rate at which both cheaters and honest players can gain or lose wealth, contributing to a deeper understanding of deception in asset exchange models.</description>

      <title>Automated Dynamic Image Analysis for Particle Size and Shape Classification in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OCULAR, an innovative hardware and software solution for three-dimensional dynamic image analysis of fine particles. Current state-of-the art instruments for dynamic image analysis are largely limited to two-dimensional imaging. However, extensive literature has demonstrated that relying on a single two-dimensional projection for particle characterisation can lead to inaccuracies in many applications. Existing three-dimensional imaging technologies, such as computed tomography, laser scanning, and orthophotography, are limited to static objects. These methods are often not statistically representative and come with significant post-processing requirements, as well as the need for specialised imaging and computing resources. OCULAR addresses these challenges by providing a cost-effective solution for imaging continuous particle streams using a synchronised array of optical cameras. Particle shape characterisation is achieved through the reconstruction of their three-dimensional surfaces. This paper details the OCULAR methodology, evaluates its reproducibility, and compares its results against X-ray micro computed tomography, highlighting its potential for efficient and reliable particle analysis.</description>

      <title>The quantum magic of fermionic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in magic at the topological phase boundary, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review aspects of anti de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) duality and the notion of holographic renormalization group (RG) flow. We start by discussing supersymmetry and construct the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory in d = 4 by Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction method. Then, we study the large-N limit and how it leads to the AdS/CFT duality. Using AdS/CFT, we then study the super-gravitational dual flows to the RG flows in CFT generated by marginal and relevant deformations, using the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory as an example. Then, we prove the Zamolodchikov C-theorem holographically. Finally, we discuss the Wilsonian holographic renormalization.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic density-functional theory for the moving contact-line problem reveals fluid structure and emergence of a spatially distinct pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nanoscale effects controlling the dynamics of a contact line -- defined as the line formed at the junction of two fluid phases and a solid -- has been a longstanding problem in fluid mechanics pushing experimental and numerical methods to their limits. A major challenge is the multiscale nature of the problem, whereby nanoscale phenomena manifest themselves at the macroscale. To probe the nanoscale, not easily accessible to other methods, we propose a reductionist model that employs elements from statistical mechanics, namely dynamic-density-functional theory (DDFT), in a Navier-Stokes-like equation -- an approach we name hydrodynamic DDFT. The model is applied to an isothermal Lennard-Jones-fluid with no slip on a flat solid substrate. Our computations reveal fluid stratification with an oscillatory density structure close to the wall and the emergence of two distinct regions as the temperature increases: a region of compression on the vapor side of the liquid-vapour interface and an effective slip region of large shear on the liquid side. The compressive region spreads along the fluid interface at a lengthscale that increases faster than the width of the fluid interface with temperature, while the width of the slip region is bound by the oscillatory fluid density structure and is constrained to a few particle diameters from the wall. Both compressive and shear effects may offset contact line friction, while compression in particular has a disproportionately high effect on the speed of advancing contact lines at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Theory of Microphase Separation in Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Heating of a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium processes at ultralow temperatures are central to quantum physics and technology. In such extreme environments, quantum coherence and dissipation can interact intimately to give rise to intriguing thermalization phenomena. Here, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate a novel scenario of thermalization in an ultracold atomic system, distinct from various quantum thermalization scenarios currently under intense investigations. We observe that after a sudden quench, an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) behaves as a rigid body and undergoes a random walk in momentum space due to atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal component. Consequently its center of mass degree of freedom gets heated up at a constant rate. This heating mechanism, rooted in random momentum scattering, falls into the paradigm of stochastic heating initiated by Fermi and thoroughly explored in plasma physics, which differs conceptually from the traditional thermal conduction. At longer times, the stochastic heating of the BEC is balanced by forced evaporative cooling, and a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is achieved. Our findings offer new perspectives on the non-equilibrium dynamics of open Bose systems at ultralow temperature and quantum thermalization.</description>

Abstract: We present an introduction to the theory of open extended quantum systems. We begin with a microscopic derivation of the so-called Lindblad equation followed by a more abstract approach. Next, we introduce collision models, a versatile framework that offers a possible unraveling of the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. We finally discuss concrete situations involving quantum transport phenomena, the generation and replication of entanglement or even the non-thermal relaxation of cold atomic gases confined in optical traps.</description>

      <title>The transition to speciation in the finite genome Derrida-Higgs model: a heuristic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of speciation, where an ancestral species divides in two or more new species, involves several geographic, environmental and genetic components that interact in a complex way. Understanding all these elements at once is challenging and simple models can help unveiling the role of each factor separately. The Derrida-Higgs model describes the evolution of a sexually reproducing population subjected to mutations in a well mixed population. Individuals are characterized by a string with entries $\pm1$ representing a haploid genome with biallelic genes. If mating is restricted by genetic similarity, so that only individuals that are sufficiently similar can mate, sympatric speciation, i.e. the emergence of species without geographic isolation, can occur. Only four parameters rule the dynamics: population size $N$, mutation rate $\mu$, minimum similarity for mating $q_{min}$ and genome size $B$. In the limit $B\rightarrow\infty$, speciation occurs if the simple condition $q_{min}&gt;(1+4\mu N)^{-1}$ is satisfied. However, this condition fails for finite genomes, and speciation does not occur if the genome size is too small. This indicates the existence of a critical genome size for speciation. In this work, we develop an analytical theory of the distribution of similarities between individuals, a quantity that defines how tight or spread out is the genetic content of the population. This theory is carried out in the absence of mating restrictions, where evolution equations for the mean and variance of the similarity distribution can be derived. We then propose a heuristic description of the speciation transition which allows us to numerically calculate the critical genome size for speciation as a function of the other model parameters. The result is in good agreement with the simulations of the model and may guide further investigations on theoretical conditions for species formation.</description>

      <title>Effect of simple shear on knotted polymer coils and globules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effect of Couette flow on knotted linear polymer chains with extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Hydrodynamic interactions are accounted for by means of Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD). The polymer chain, containing originally a simple trefoil knot at rest, is described by a coarse-grained bead-spring model in a coil or globular state. We demonstrate that under shear existing loosely localized knots in polymer coils typically tighten to several segments beyond a certain shear rate threshold. At large shear rates the polymer undergoes a tumbling-like motion during which knot sizes can fluctuate. In contrast, sheared knotted globules unwind into a convoluted pearl-necklace structure of sub-globules that folds back onto itself and in which knot types change over time.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Non-equilibrium Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) characterize critical changes in system behavior occurring at finite times, providing a lens to study nonequilibrium phenomena beyond conventional equilibrium physics. While extensively studied in quantum systems, DPTs have remained largely unexplored in classical settings. Recent experiments on complex systems, from social networks to financial markets, have revealed abrupt dynamical changes analogous to quantum DPTs, motivating the search for a theoretical understanding. Here, we present a minimal model for nonequilibrium networks, demonstrating that nonlinear interactions among network edges naturally give rise to DPTs. Specifically, we show that network degree diverges at a finite critical time, following a universal hyperbolic scaling, consistent with empirical observations. Our analytical results predict that key network properties, including degree distributions and clustering coefficients, exhibit critical scaling as criticality approaches. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding emergent nonequilibrium criticality across diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>What makes it possible to learn probability distributions in the natural world?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organisms and algorithms learn probability distributions from previous observations, either over evolutionary time or on the fly. In the absence of regularities, estimating the underlying distribution from data would require observing each possible outcome many times. Here we show that two conditions allow us to escape this infeasible requirement. First, the mutual information between two halves of the system should be consistently sub-extensive. Second, this shared information should be compressible, so that it can be represented by a number of bits proportional to the information rather than to the entropy. Under these conditions, a distribution can be described with a number of parameters that grows linearly with system size. These conditions are borne out in natural images and in models from statistical physics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Identifying percolation phase transitions with unsupervised learning based on largest clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning in the study of phase transitions has achieved remarkable success in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. It is widely recognized that unsupervised learning can retrieve phase transition information through hidden variables. However, using unsupervised methods to identify the critical point of percolation models has remained an intriguing challenge. This paper suggests that, by inputting the largest cluster rather than the original configuration into the learning model, unsupervised learning can indeed predict the critical point of the percolation model. Furthermore, we observe that when the largest cluster configuration is randomly shuffled-altering the positions of occupied sites or bonds-there is no significant difference in the output compared to learning the largest cluster configuration directly. This finding suggests a more general principle: unsupervised learning primarily captures particle density, or more specifically, occupied site density. However, shuffling does impact the formation of the largest cluster, which is directly related to phase transitions. As randomness increases, we observe that the correlation length tends to decrease, providing direct evidence of this relationship. We also propose a method called Fake Finite Size Scaling (FFSS) to calculate the critical value, which improves the accuracy of fitting to a great extent.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the periodically driven dynamics of many-body systems, either classical or quantum, finite-dimensional or mean-field, displaying an unbounded phase-space. Using the lattice $\phi^4$ model and the $p$-spin spherical model as representative examples, we find that the inclusion of a smooth periodic drive atop an otherwise ergodic dynamics leads to a long-lived prethermalization, even at moderate driving frequencies. In specific asymptotic limits, we compute the corresponding prethermal Hamiltonian from an analytical perturbation scheme.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle with saturating rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle whose speed and tumbling rate are space-dependent on an infinite line. Unlike most of the previous work on such models, here we make the physical assumption that at large distances, these rates saturate to a constant. For our choice of rate functions, we show that a stationary state exists, and the exact steady state distribution decays exponentially or faster and can be unimodal or bimodal. The effect of boundedness of rates is seen in the mean-squared displacement of the particle that displays qualitative features different from those observed in the previous studies where it approaches the stationary state value monotonically in time; in contrast, here we find that if the initial position of the particle is sufficiently far from the origin, the variance in its position either varies nonmonotonically or plateaus before reaching the stationary state. These results are captured quantitatively by the exact solution of the Green's function when the particle has uniform speed but the tumbling rates change as a step-function in space; the insights provided by this limiting case are found to be consistent with the numerical results for the general model.</description>

      <title>Managing Singular Kernels and Logarithmic Corrections in the Staggered Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of the staggered six-vertex model with ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetry for arbitrary system sizes $L$ using non-linear integral equations (NLIEs). Our study is motivated by two key questions: what is the accuracy of results based on the ODE/IQFT correspondence in the asymptotic regime of large system sizes, and what is the optimal approach based on NLIE for analyzing the staggered six-vertex model?
  We demonstrate that the quantization conditions for low-lying primary and descendant states, derived from the ODE/IQFT approach in the scaling limit, are impressively accurate even for relatively small system sizes. Specifically, in the anisotropy parameter range $\pi/4 &lt; \gamma &lt; \pi/2$, the difference between NLIE and ODE/IQFT results for energy and quasi-momentum eigenvalues is of order $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2})$.
  Furthermore, we present a unifying framework for NLIEs, distinguishing between versions with singular and regular kernels. We provide a compact derivation of NLIE with a singular kernel, followed by an equivalent set with a regular kernel. We address the stability issues in numerical treatments and offer solutions to achieve high-accuracy results, validating our approach for system sizes ranging from $L=2$ to $L=10^{24}$.
  Our findings not only validate the ODE/IQFT approach for finite system sizes but also enhance the understanding of NLIEs in the context of the staggered six-vertex model. We hope the insights gained from this study have significant implications for resolving the spectral problem of other lattice systems with emergent non-compact degrees of freedom and provide a foundation for future research in this domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like the letters in the alphabet forming words, reusing components of a heterogeneous mixture is an efficient strategy for assembling a large number of target structures. Examples range from synthetic DNA origami to proteins self-assembling into complexes. The standard self-assembly paradigm views target structures as free-energy minima of a mixture. While this is an appealing picture, at high speed structures may be kinetically trapped in local minima, reducing self-assembly accuracy. How then can high speed, high accuracy, and combinatorial usage of components coexist? We propose to reconcile these three concepts not by avoiding kinetic traps, but by exploiting them to encode target structures. This can be achieved by sculpting the kinetic pathways of the mixture, instead of its free-energy landscape. We formalize these ideas in a minimal toy model, for which we analytically estimate the encoding capacity and kinetic characteristics, in agreement with simulations. Our results may be generalized to other soft-matter systems capable of computation, such as liquid mixtures or elastic networks, and pave the way for high-dimensional information processing far from equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study negative large deviations of the long-time empirical front velocity of the center of mass of the one-sided $N$-BBM ($N$-particle branching Brownian motion) system in one dimension. Employing the macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study the probability that $c$ is smaller than the limiting front velocity $c_0$, predicted by the deterministic theory, or even becomes negative. To this end we determine the optimal path of the system, conditioned on the specified $c$. We show that for $c_0-c\ll c_0$ the properly defined rate function $s(c)$, coincides, up to a non-universal numerical factor, with the universal rate functions for front models belonging to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov universality class. For sufficiently large negative values of $c$, $s(c)$ approaches a simple bound, obtained under the assumption that the branching is completely suppressed during the whole time. Remarkably, for all $c\leq c_*$, where $c_*&lt;0$ is a critical value that we find numerically, the rate function $s(c)$ is \emph{equal} to the simple bound. At the critical point $c=c_*$ the character of the optimal path changes, and the rate function exhibits a dynamical phase transition of second order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of interacting walkers on a two-dimensional space where the dynamics of each walker are governed by the opinions of agents of a three-state opinion dynamics model are considered. Such walks, inspired by Ising-like models and opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one-dimensional virtual spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point. The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X axis.
  The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well as in the exponents.</description>

Abstract: We research the ground state of the $S = 1$ XXZ spin chain with single ion anisotropy, focusing on XY1, XY2 (Spin Nematic), Neel, Haldane phases. Recently, it was reported that the four phases did not intersect at a single point using conventional numerical methods, which is inconsistent with the bosonization theory. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we propose a unified method to determine phase boundaries by combining conformal field theory (CFT) with numerical diagonalization. And we discuss the symmetry and universality class of the multicritical point.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Quantum States and Universal Correlations in a Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over a 1D Ground State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains with local interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero temperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two parts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One side of the chain settles into a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the couplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in integrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the maximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer that, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of order $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the same scaling. Thus, the interfacial region exhibits full range correlations, indicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all order parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an analysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster decomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial region, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum state.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relaxation of finite-wavevector density waves in a facilitated classical lattice gas. Linear hydrodynamics predicts that such perturbations should relax exponentially, but nonlinear effects were predicted to cause subexponential relaxation via nonperturbative long-time tails. We present a detailed numerical study of this effect. While our results clearly indicate the importance of nonlinear effects, we find that the wavevector-dependence of the late-time relaxation is clearly inconsistent with theoretical predictions. We discuss manifestations of hydrodynamic nonlinearities in mesoscopic samples and at short times.</description>

      <title>A kinetically constrained model exhibiting non-linear diffusion and jamming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a classical kinetically constrained model of interacting particles on a triangular ladder, which displays diffusion and jamming and can be treated by means of a classical-quantum mapping. Interpreted as a theory of interacting fermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the quasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical density \r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which exponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive. The model can be generalized to two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings for the Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L&gt;4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture.
  Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Exponentially Many Low Lying States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that for near-extremal black holes, the entropy and the energy above extremality respectively receive a logT and a T-linear correction, where T is the temperature. We show that both these features can be derived in a low but not too low temperature regime, by assuming the existence of exponentially many low lying states cleanly separated from rest of the spectrum, without using any specific theory. Argument of the logarithm in the expression of entropy is seen to be the ratio of temperature and the bandwidth of the low lying states. We argue that such spectrum might arise in non-supersymmetric extremal brane systems. Our findings strengthen Page's suggestion that there is no true degeneracy for non-supersymmetric extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Space Ergodicity in Driven Quantum Systems: Obstructions and Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its long history, a canonical formulation of quantum ergodicity that applies to general classes of quantum dynamics, including driven systems, has not been fully established. Here we introduce and study a notion of quantum ergodicity for closed systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians, defined as statistical randomness exhibited in their longtime dynamics. Concretely, we consider the temporal ensemble of quantum states (time-evolution operators) generated by the evolution, and investigate the conditions necessary for them to be statistically indistinguishable from uniformly random states (operators) in the Hilbert space (space of unitaries). We find that the number of driving frequencies underlying the Hamiltonian needs to be sufficiently large for this to occur. Conversely, we show that statistical pseudo-randomness -- indistinguishability up to some large but finite moment, can already be achieved by a quantum system driven with a single frequency, i.e., a Floquet system, as long as the driving period is sufficiently long. Our work relates the complexity of a time-dependent Hamiltonian and that of the resulting quantum dynamics, and offers a fresh perspective to the established topics of quantum ergodicity and chaos from the lens of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Critical Properties of Weak Measurement Induced Phase Transitions in Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of different forms of weak measurements on the nature of the measurement induced phase transition are theoretically studied in hybrid random quantum circuits of qubits. We use a combination of entanglement measures, ancilla purification dynamics, and a transfer matrix approach to compute the critical exponents, the effective central charge, and the multifractal spectrum of the measurement induced transitions. We compare weak measurements with an infinite number of discrete outcomes to a protocol with only a pair of outcomes and find that to within our numerical accuracy the universal critical properties are unaffected by the weak measurement protocols and are consistent with the universality class found for strong projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Interplay of Attention Paths in a Statistical Mechanics Theory of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical performance of Transformers, their theoretical understanding remains elusive. Here, we consider a deep multi-head self-attention network, that is closely related to Transformers yet analytically tractable. We develop a statistical mechanics theory of Bayesian learning in this model, deriving exact equations for the network's predictor statistics under the finite-width thermodynamic limit, i.e., $N,P\rightarrow\infty$, $P/N=\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $N$ is the network width and $P$ is the number of training examples. Our theory shows that the predictor statistics are expressed as a sum of independent kernels, each one pairing different 'attention paths', defined as information pathways through different attention heads across layers. The kernels are weighted according to a 'task-relevant kernel combination' mechanism that aligns the total kernel with the task labels. As a consequence, this interplay between attention paths enhances generalization performance. Experiments confirm our findings on both synthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. Finally, our theory explicitly relates the kernel combination mechanism to properties of the learned weights, allowing for a qualitative transfer of its insights to models trained via gradient descent. As an illustration, we demonstrate an efficient size reduction of the network, by pruning those attention heads that are deemed less relevant by our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that by imposing the conformal Wald identity, one can extract conformal data of the corresponding short-range/local CFT from the long-range perturbation theory. We first apply this to the O(N) vector model. We demonstrate that by properly re-sum the perturbative series, one gets reasonable estimations of the critical exponents of the local/short-range CFTs. We then apply this method to study fermionic models with four-fermion interactions. In 2+1 dimensions, the model has the Gross-Neveu coupling and the Thirring coupling. We also consider a 4+1 dimensional theory with a generalized Thirring coupling.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetries in prethermal phases of periodically driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven closed quantum systems are expected to eventually heat up to infinite temperature reaching a steady state described by a circular orthogonal ensemble (COE). However, such finite driven systems may exhibit sufficiently long prethermal regimes; their properties in these regimes are qualitatively different from that in their infinite temperature steady states. These, often experimentally relevant, prethermal regimes host a wide range of phenomena; they may exhibit dynamical localization and freezing, host Floquet scars, display signatures of Hilbert space fragmentation, and exhibit time crystalline phases. Such phenomena are often accompanied by emergent approximate dynamical symmetries which have no analogue in equilibrium systems. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the origin and nature of these symmetries and discuss their role in shaping the prethermal phases of a class of periodically driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <title>How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for generative models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. Moreover, by comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to Y. Nakayama and T. Tanaka, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that two independent spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains provide an effective platform for the quantum teleportation of any entangled two-qubit state through the quantum communication channel formed by two Heisenberg dimers. The reliability of this quantum channel is assessed by comparing the concurrences, which quantify a strength of the bipartite entanglement of the initial input state and the readout output state. Additionally, we rigorously calculate quantities fidelity and average fidelity to evaluate the quality of the teleportation protocol depending on temperature and magnetic field. It is evidenced that the efficiency of quantum teleportation of arbitrary entangled two-qubit state through this quantum communication channel can be significantly enhanced by moderate magnetic fields. This enhancement can be attributed to the magnetic-field-driven transition from a quantum antiferromagnetic phase to a quantum ferrimagnetic phase, which supports realization of a fully entangled quantum channel suitable for efficient quantum teleportation. The polymeric trimer chains Cu3(P2O6OH)2 are proposed as an experimental resource of this quantum communication channel, which provides an efficient platform for realization of the quantum teleportation up to moderate temperatures 40 K and extremely high magnetic fields 80 T.</description>
