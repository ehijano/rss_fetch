      <title>The asymmetric rotating saddle potential as a mechanical analog to the RF Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under specific conditions, a rotating saddle potential can confine the motion of a particle on its surface. This time-varying hyperbolic potential shares key characteristics with the RF electric quadrupole ion trap (RF Paul trap), making it a valuable mechanical analog. Previous work has primarily focused on symmetric saddles, characterized by equal curvatures along the trapping and anti-trapping directions. However, most applications of RF Paul traps-such as atomic clocks, quantum computing, and quantum simulations-require asymmetry in the quadrupole potential to break the degeneracy of motional modes, which is essential for processes like laser cooling and other quantum manipulations. In this paper, we investigate the motion of trapped particles in asymmetric rotating saddles. We demonstrate that even minor asymmetries, including those arising from manufacturing imperfections, can significantly affect particle trajectories and stability. Our analysis includes both theoretical modeling and experimental measurements. We derive the equations of motion for asymmetric saddles and solve them to explore stability and precession effects. Additionally, we present lifetime measurements of particles in saddles with varying degrees of asymmetry to map key features of the a-q stability diagram, including counterintuitive demonstrations of stability for saddles with negative asymmetry. This study underscores the importance of incorporating asymmetry into mechanical models of ion traps to better reflect real-world implementations. Although motivated primarily by RF Paul traps, these asymmetry-related results are also relevant to emerging gravitational analogs, such as rotating saddle potentials in certain binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Momentum imaging and kinetic energy release measurements for various fragmentation pathways in MeV energy proton collision with $SO_2$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the ionization and fragmentation of $SO_2$ molecular target in collision with 1 MeV proton beam using the technique of recoil ion momentum spectroscopy. Fragmentation dynamics of doubly charged $SO_2^{2+}$ molecular ion has been investigated in detail using Dalitz plot and Newton diagrams. We have identified concerted and sequential dissociation pathways in three body dissociation of the parent molecular ion. 3D momentum distribution of all fragment particles, including the neutral atom, were obtained along with the kinetic energy release spectra for various fragmentation channels.</description>

      <title>Below threshold nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized two-color fields II: Quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of intra-channel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized bichromatic fields, focusing on the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism, and employing the strong-field approximation. We generalize and elaborate several analytic interference conditions for RESI in arbitrary driving fields, with a focus on the interference arising from the specific symmetries of bichromatic fields. For example, for waves of comparable strengths, multiple events per half cycle for the direct electron must be considered. Furthermore, interference breaks some of the symmetries arising from the field. We detangle the superimposed interference fringes originating from phase differences related to symmetrization due to electron exchange, temporal shifts and a combination of exchange and event interference. We show that the hierarchy between exchange-only and exchange-temporal interference is fluid and can be manipulated by an appropriate choice of driving-field parameters. This is enabled by different types of interference occupying specific regions of the plane spanned by the electron momentum components parallel to the driving-field polarization.</description>

      <title>UK APAP R-matrix electron-impact excitation cross-sections for modelling laboratory and astrophysical plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic R-matrix calculations of electron-impact excitation for ions of astrophysical interest have been performed since 2007 for many iso-electronic sequences as part of the UK Atomic Process for Astrophysical Plasma (APAP) network. Rate coefficients for Maxwellian electron distributions have been provided and used extensively in the literature and many databases for astrophysics. Here, we provide averaged collision strengths to be used to model plasma where electrons are non-Maxwellian, which often occur in laboratory and astrophysical plasma. We also provide for many ions new Maxwellian-averaged collision strengths which include important corrections to the published values. The H- and He-like atomic data were recently made available in Mao+(2022). Here, we provide data for ions of the Li-, Be-, B-, C-, N-, O-, Ne-, Na-, and Mg-like sequences.</description>

      <title>Multiqubit GHZ state preparation with $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$ ions for frequency standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state preparation is demonstrated on two to eight qubits in the chain of ten $^{171}Yb^+$ ions in the linear Paul trap with a sequence of single-qubit and two-qubit operations and pulsed dynamical decupling. Fidelity of the 8-qubit GHZ state is estimated to be $58.9 \pm 0.6\%$. The expected enhanced sensitivity of the parity oscillations phase to the analyzing pulse phase is observed. This result is a step towards a multi-ion optical clock with ytterbium ions with frequency averaging following $1/N$ scaling law in contrast to the slower $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling for an ensemble of independent particles in case when the decoherence is dominated by the spontaneous decay.</description>

      <title>Scalable chip-based 3D ion traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion traps are used for a wide range of applications from metrology to quantum simulations and quantum information processing. Microfabricated chip-based 3D ion traps are scalable to store many ions for the realization of a large number of qubits, provide deep trapping potentials compared to surface traps, and very good shielding from external electric fields. In this work, we give an overview of our recent developments on chip-based 3D ion traps. Different types of chip materials, the integration of electronic filter components on-chip and compact electrical connections in vacuum are discussed. Further, based on finite element method (FEM) simulations, we discuss how integrating micro-optics in 3D ion traps is possible without disturbing the trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Analog phase-sensitive time-reversal of optically-carried radiofrequency signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving low-latency time-reversal of broadband radiofrequency signals is crucial for reliable communications in dynamic, uncontrolled environments. However, existing approaches are either digitally assisted -- making broadband extension challenging -- or limited to amplitude modulation. In this work, we report the very first experimental realization of a fully analog, phase-preserving time-reversal architecture for optically-carried radiofrequency signals. The method exploits the exceptional coherence properties of rare-earth ion-doped materials, and leverages the well-established photon echo mechanism, widely used in quantum technologies. While our demonstration is conducted with a modest bandwidth, we identify the fundamental cause of this limitation and propose solutions for future scalability.</description>

      <title>A Trade-Off Between Path Entanglement and Quantum Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>

      <title>Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</description>
