      <title>Generalized homomorphisms and KK with extra structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the approach via quasihomomorphisms and the universal algebra $qA$ to Kasparov's $KK$-theory, so as to cover versions of $KK$ such as $KK^{nuc}$, $KK^G$ and ideal related $KK$-theory.</description>

      <title>Gersten's Injectivity for Smooth Algebras over Valuation Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gersten's injectivity conjecture for a functor $F$ of ``motivic type'', predicts that given a semilocal, ``non-singular'', integral domain $R$ with a fraction field $K$, the restriction morphism induces an injection of $F(R)$ inside $F(K)$. We prove two new cases of this conjecture for smooth algebras over valuation rings. Namely, we show that the higher algebraic $K$-groups of a semilocal, integral domain that is an essentially smooth algebra over an equicharacteristic valuation ring inject inside the same of its fraction field. Secondly, we show that Gersten's injectivity is true for smooth algebras over, possibly of mixed-characteristic, valuation rings in the case of torsors under tori and also in the case of the Brauer group.</description>

      <title>Bigraded path homology and the magnitude-path spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two important invariants of directed graphs, namely magnitude homology and path homology, have recently been shown to be intimately connected: there is a 'magnitude-path spectral sequence' or 'MPSS' in which magnitude homology appears as the first page, and in which path homology appears as an axis of the second page. In this paper we study the homological and computational properties of the spectral sequence, and in particular of the full second page, which we now call 'bigraded path homology'. We demonstrate that every page of the MPSS deserves to be regarded as a homology theory in its own right, satisfying excision and Kunneth theorems (along with a homotopy invariance property already established by Asao), and that magnitude homology and bigraded path homology also satisfy Mayer-Vietoris theorems. We construct a homotopy theory of graphs (in the form of a cofibration category structure) in which weak equivalences are the maps inducing isomorphisms on bigraded path homology, strictly refining an existing structure based on ordinary path homology. And we provide complete computations of the MPSS for two important families of graphs - the directed and bi-directed cycles - which demonstrate the power of both the MPSS, and bigraded path homology in particular, to distinguish graphs that ordinary path homology cannot.</description>

      <title>Bredon motivic cohomology of the real numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the real numbers with $\Z/2-$coefficients, we compute the $C_2$-equivariant Borel motivic cohomology ring, the Bredon motivic cohomology groups and prove that the Bredon motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers is a proper subring in the $RO(C_2\times C_2)$-graded Bredon cohomology ring of a point.
  This generalizes Voevodsky's computation of the motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers to the $C_2$-equivariant setting. These computations are extended afterwards to any real closed field.</description>

      <title>On the first $\tau$-tilting Hochschild cohomology of an algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce, according to one of the main ideas of $\tau$-tilting theory, the $\tau$-tilting Hochschild cohomology in degree one of a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $\la$, where $k$ is a field. We define the excess of $\la$ as the difference between the dimensions of the $\tau$-tilting Hochschild cohomology in degree one and the dimension of the usual Hochschild cohomology in degree one.
  One of the main results is that for a zero excess bound quiver algebra $\la=kQ/I$, the Hochschild cohomology in degree two $HH^2(\la) $ is isomorphic to the space of morphisms $\Hom_{kQ-kQ}(I/I^2, \la).$ This may be useful to determine when $HH^2(\la)=0$ for these algebras.
  We compute the excess for hereditary, radical square zero and monomial triangular algebras. For a bound quiver algebra $\la$, a formula for the excess of $\la$ is obtained. We also give a criterion for $\la$ to be $\tau$-rigid.</description>

      <title>Alternating cochains on Furstenberg boundaries and measurable cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nicolas Monod showed that the evaluation map $$H^*_m(G\curvearrowright G/P)\longrightarrow H^*_m(G)$$ between the measurable cohomology of the action of a connected semisimple Lie group $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary $G/P$ and the measurable cohomology of $G$ is surjective with a non-trivial kernel in all degrees below a constant depending on $G$ and less than or equal to the rank of $G$ plus $2$. When we were looking for explicit representatives of classes in this kernel, we were astonished to discover that some of these nontrivial classes have trivial alternation. In this paper, we refine Monod's result by identifying the non-alternating and alternating cohomology classes in this kernel. As a consequence, we show that $H^*_m(G)$ is isomorphic to the alternating measurable cohomology of $G$ acting on $G/P$ in all even degrees $$H^{2k}_{m,\mathrm{alt}}(G\curvearrowright G/P)\cong H^{2k}_m(G),$$ for a majority of Lie groups, namely those for which the longest element of the Weyl group acts as $-1$ on the Lie algebra of a maximal split torus $A$ in $G$.</description>
