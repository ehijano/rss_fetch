      <title>Forecasting Intraday Volume in Equity Markets with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on forecasting intraday trading volumes, a crucial component for portfolio implementation, especially in high-frequency (HF) trading environments. Given the current scarcity of flexible methods in this area, we employ a suite of machine learning (ML) models enriched with numerous HF predictors to enhance the predictability of intraday trading volumes. Our findings reveal that intraday stock trading volume is highly predictable, especially with ML and considering commonality. Additionally, we assess the economic benefits of accurate volume forecasting through Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. The results demonstrate that precise intraday forecasting offers substantial advantages, providing valuable insights for traders to optimize their strategies.</description>

      <title>DeFi Liquidation Risk Modeling Using the Reflection Principle for Zero-Drift Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an analytical method to compute the collateral liquidation probability in decentralized finance (DeFi) stablecoin single-collateral lending. Our approach models the collateral exchange rate as a zero-drift geometric Brownian motion, converts it into a regular zero-drift Brownian motion, and employs the reflection principle to derive the liquidation probability. Unlike most existing methods that rely on computationally intensive simulations such as Monte Carlo, our formula provides a lightweight, exact solution. This advancement offers a more efficient alternative for risk assessment in DeFi platforms.</description>

      <title>Robust and Fast Bass local volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bass Local Volatility Model (Bass-LV), as studied in [Conze and Henry-Labordere, 2021], stands out for its ability to eliminate the need for interpolation between maturities. This offers a significant advantage over traditional LV models. However, its performance highly depends on accurate construction of state price densities and the corresponding marginal distributions and efficient numerical convolutions which are necessary when solving the associated fixed point problems. In this paper, we propose a new approach combining local quadratic estimation and lognormal mixture tails for the construction of state price densities. We investigate computational efficiency of trapezoidal rule based schemes for numerical convolutions and show that they outperform commonly used Gauss-Hermite quadrature. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, both in standard option pricing models, as well as through a detailed market case study.</description>

      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity/FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities/cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>
