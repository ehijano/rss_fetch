      <title>Nonlocality Effect in the Tunneling of Alpha Radioactivity with the Aid of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, building upon the research findings of E. L. Medeiros, we have extended the alpha-particle non-locality effect to the two-potential approach (TPA). This extension demonstrates that the integration of the alpha-particle nonlocality effect into TPA yields relatively favorable results. In the present work, we employ machine learning methods to further optimize the aforementioned approach, specifically utilizing three classical machine learning models: decision tree regression, random forest regression, and XGBRegressor. Among these models, both the decision tree regression and XGBRegressor models exhibit the highest degree of agreement with the reference data, whereas the random forest regression model shows inferior performance. In terms of standard deviation, the results derived from the decision tree regression and XGBRegressor models represent improvements of 54.5% and 53.7%, respectively, compared to the TPA that does not account for the coordinate-dependent effective mass of alpha particles. Furthermore, we extend the decision tree regression and XGBRegressor models to predict the alpha-decay half-lives of 20 even-even nuclei with atomic numbers Z=118 and Z=120. Subsequently, the superheavy nucleus half-life predictions generated by our proposed models are compared with those from two established benchmarks: the improved eight-parameter Deng-Zhang-Royer (DZR) model and the new empirical expression (denoted as "New+D") proposed by V. Yu. Denisov, which explicitly incorporates nuclear deformation effects. Overall, the predictions from these models and formulas are generally consistent. Notably, the predictions of the decision tree regression model show a high level of consistency with those of the New+D expression, while the XGBRegressor model exhibits deviations from the other two comparative models.</description>

      <title>Neutron emission during fission and its impact on fission-fragment mass distribution studied by Langevin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actinide nuclei exhibit mass-asymmetric fission at low energy due to shell structure. The fission-fragment mass distributions produced at high energy tend to have a symmetric shape due to smearing of shell effects. On the other hand, the distribution can be changed by neutron emission occurring before fission, as this decreases the excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus, and thus revives the shell structure. In so called multichance fission, neutron emission is considered prior to fission at the initial nuclear shape, and competition between fission and neutron emission is determined with the framework of the statistical model. In the present work, we describe fission in the Langevin equations, and neutron emission is treated throughout the fission process. The calculation reproduces experimentally observed mass distributions, and for a wide range of initial compound-nucleus excitation energy up to 60 MeV. The results show that, while neutron emission dominates at the ground-state shape, it occurs along the shape evolution path to the scission point.</description>

      <title>Probing momentum dependence of hydrodynamization in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluidity of the hot and dense QCD matter is a key characteristic of the medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We extend the framework of the relativistic hydrodynamic model to incorporate non-thermal momentum distributions that may emerge during the dynamical evolution of the collision system. Numerical simulations are performed to elucidate the phenomenological implications of these modifications on charged hadrons and direct photons measured in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-decay systematics for superheavy nucleus: the effect of deformation of daughter nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, V.Yu. Denisov proposed a new empirical formula incorporating the deformation of the daughter nucleus, which has significantly improved the description of $\alpha$-decay half-lives for even-even nuclei compared to formulas neglecting the deformation of the daughter nucleus. In this work, we generalize the deformation of the daughter nucleus proposed by V.Yu. Denisov to the DUR model, the AKRA model, the New Geiger-Nuttall law, generating three improved versions of these models. We then employ both the original and modified the DUR model, the AKRA model, and the New Geiger-Nuttall law to investigate the $\alpha$-decay half-lives of 400 isotopes. Results show that among the six models, the modified AKRA model provides the closest agreement with experimental $\alpha$-decay half-life data. For comparative analysis, we use the new empirical formulas developed for the DUR model (DUR+D), the AKRA model (AKRA+D) and a new empirical (ND) proposed by V.Yu. Denisov to predict the $\alpha$-decay properties of 71 even-even nuclei with Z = 118, 120, 122, and 124. The predictions from the DUR+D model, the AKRA+D model, and ND are largely consistent overall. Notably, when the neutron number $N&gt;190$, the predictions from the DUR+D model and the AKRA+D model exceed those of ND, which may be attributed to additional physical contributions (e.g., the hexadecapole and the hexacontatetrapole deformation of the deformed daughter nucleus) incorporated in the DUR+D model and the AKRA+D model but not in ND.</description>

      <title>Charm-strange meson production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charm-strange mesons, or $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons by focusing on their production by coalescence from a quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Starting from the investigation of the transverse momentum distribution of both charm and strange quarks through transverse momentum distributions of $\phi$ and $D^0$ mesons, we calculate the transverse momentum distributions and yields of $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons based on the coalescence model. We find that the yield and transverse momentum distribution of the $D_s$ meson agree well with the experimental measurements at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at LHC. We further evaluate the transverse momentum ratio between $D_s$ and $D^0$ mesons, and investigate the role of light and strange quarks in the production of charmed mesons in heavy ion collisions. Finally, we calculate the transverse momentum distribution and yield of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a four-quark state, and compare to those of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a two-quark state.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the deuteron with a hadronic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interactions of the deuteron with light mesons during the hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions. We treat the deuteron as a weakly bound state and employ the quasi-free approximation to describe the $d\pi$ interaction. The underlying elementary $N\pi$ amplitudes are described by a hybrid effective model, combining the non-resonant background from chiral perturbation theory with resonant contributions via Breit-Wigner parameterizations. These amplitudes are used to calculate the vacuum and thermally-averaged cross-sections for deuteron dissociation and production, namely, $d + \pi \rightarrow N + N' + \pi$ and the corresponding inverse reaction. We then use these cross sections in a rate equation to estimate the time evolution of the deuteron multiplicity. For the initial conditions we consider two models: the statistical hadronization model and the coalescence model, where the deuteron is treated as a hadronic molecule. Our findings suggest that the final deuteron yield does not retain a memory of its initial production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</description>

Abstract: We present the historical antecedents to the field of relativistic heavy ion physics, beginning with early attempts to model the strong interaction and ending with the endorsement of a relativistic heavy ion collider in the 1983 U.S. Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science. Particular attention is paid to two major themes: 1) A program to study high density states of nuclear matter emerging from the 1974 Bear Mountain conference and 2) Efforts to understand the predictions of QCD for matter at high densities and/or temperatures.</description>

      <title>In-medium effects of nucleon-nucleon cross sections in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we systematically investigate the in-medium effects of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) cross sections on nucleonic and pionic observables in heavy-ion collisions, employing microscopic cross sections derived from the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach. Key observables include nuclear stopping, the neutron-to-proton ($n/p$) ratio, neutron-proton transverse flow differences, differential collective flow, pion multiplicities, and the resulting $(\pi^-/\pi^+)_{\text{like}}$ ratio. The analysis disentangles the respective contributions from the scattering amplitude, the density of states, and the total momentum ($K$) of the colliding pairs. We find that larger in-medium $NN$ cross sections generally enhance free nucleon emission and nuclear stopping, with the nucleon effective mass playing a dominant suppressive role. However, it is insufficient to account only for the medium corrections from effective mass: both the medium effect from the scattering amplitude and the $K$-dependence exert noticeable influences on the observables. In particular, nuclear stopping is found to be highly sensitive to these in-medium modifications of cross sections. While the $n/p$ ratio and transverse flow difference remain largely insensitive, the differential collective flow and pion yields are strongly affected. These results indicate that the interplay between scattering amplitude, density-of-states and $K$-dependence is essential to accurately describe medium effects in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Finite density nuclear matter and neutron stars in hard-wall AdS/QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of nuclear matter, equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars and its mass-radius relation in a hard-wall AdS/QCD model by regarding baryons as solitonic configurations in gauge fields. Compared with previous approaches, we employ a different homogeneous approximation that takes into account the equations of motion for the pure gauge fields. By choosing appropriate parameters, we realize a chiral phase transition within the baryonic phase, where the chiral condensate decreases with the baryon chemical potential, until it reaches zero -- chiral symmetry is restored. In addition, independent of the existence of chiral phase transition, we also find that the speed of sound converges to the conformal limit at the density relevant to cores of massive stars but the trace of energy-momentum tensor does not vanish which indicates the pseudoconformal structure and intrinsic manifestation of scale symmetry in compact star matter. Through calculations, we obtain an equation of state that is more tightly constrained than previous works, and the resulting mass-radius relation of neutron stars is consistent with current observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effects of symmetry restoration on nuclear beta decay within the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). We employ the proton-neutron finite-amplitude method (pnFAM) to compute transition amplitudes, and perform angular-momentum projection both after variation and after the QRPA to restore rotational symmetry. Exact projection reduces the calculated beta decay half-lives from those that use the needle approximation by up to 60%, and even more when taking the effects of projection on the ground-state energy into account.</description>

      <title>Controlled Gate Networks: Theory and Application to Eigenvalue Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We present the general theory of controlled gate networks and show that, under quite general conditions, it can significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates needed to produce linear combinations of unitary operators. The first example we consider is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the rodeo algorithm using operators that we call controlled reversal gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. The third example is the application of controlled gate networks to the controlled time evolution of a free nucleon on a three-dimensional lattice. For all of the examples, we show very substantial reductions in the number of two-qubit gates required. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems such as those relevant to nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

      <title>Global QCD analysis of spin PDFs in the proton with high-$x$ and lattice constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>

      <title>New superconvergence relations for spin and tensor structure functions of $\gamma\gamma$ fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Burkhardt--Cottingham sum rule is an exact superconvergence relation for a spin-structure function, derived from general principles of light absorption and scattering, and valid at any momentum transfer $Q^2$. I illustrate how a class of such relations emerges from the Siegert point, an unphysical kinematical point where both the probe and the target are at rest. From light-by-light scattering, new sum rules for $\gamma^\ast \gamma^\ast$ fusion are emerging, valid for arbitrary photon virtualities. Regarding the convergence of these relations, there is a simple argument for the suppression of longitudinal photon polarizations at high energy. Among its consequences is the prediction of $\sigma_L/ \sigma_T \to 0$ at high energy, for the ratio of unpolarized nucleon photoabsorption cross sections.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB method for radial Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit exact WKB quantization for radial Schr\"odinger problems from the modern resurgence perspective, with emphasis on how ``physically meaningful'' quantization paths should be chosen and interpreted. Using connection formulae at simple turning points and at regular singular points, we show that the nontrivial-cycle data give the spectrum. In particular, for the $3$-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the $3$-dimensional Coulomb potential, we explicitly compute a closed contour which starts at $+\infty$, bulges into the $r&lt;0$ sector to encircle the origin, and returns to $+\infty$. Also we propose that the appropriate slice of the closed path provides a physical local basis at $r=0$, which is used by an origin-to-$\infty$ open path. Via the change of variables $r=e^x$ ($x\in(-\infty,\infty)$), the origin data are pushed to the boundary condition of convergence at $x\to-\infty$, which renders the equivalence between open-connection and closed-cycle quantization transparent. The Maslov contribution from the regular singularity is incorporated either as a small-circle monodromy which is justified in terms of renormalization group, or, equivalently, as a boundary phase; we also develop an optimized/variational perturbation theory on exact WKB. Our analysis clarifies, in radial settings, how mathematical monodromy data and physical boundary conditions dovetail, thereby addressing recent debates on path choices in resurgence-based quantization.</description>
