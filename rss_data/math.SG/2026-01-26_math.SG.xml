      <title>A Morse-Bott unification of the Grassmannians of a symplectic vector space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a quadratic Morse-Bott function on the real Grassmannian of a symplectic vector space from a compatible linear complex structure. We show that its critical loci consist of linear subspaces that split into isotropic and complex parts and that its stable manifolds coincide with the orbits of the linear symplectomorphism group. These orbits generalize the Lagrangian, symplectic, isotropic, and coisotropic Grassmannians to include the Grassmannians of linear subspaces that are neither isotropic, coisotropic, nor symplectic. The negative gradient flow deformation retracts these spaces onto compact homogeneous spaces for the unitary group.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic uncertainty principles for metaplectic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish anisotropic uncertainty principles (UPs) for general metaplectic operators acting on
  $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, including degenerate cases associated with symplectic matrices whose
  $B$-block has nontrivial kernel. In this setting, uncertainty phenomena are shown to be intrinsically
  directional and confined to an effective phase-space dimension given by $\mathrm{rank}(B)$.
  First, we prove sharp Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type inequalities involving only the directions
  corresponding to $\ker(B)^\perp$, with explicit lower bounds expressed in terms of geometric
  quantities associated with the underlying symplectic transformation. We also provide a complete
  characterization of all extremizers, which turn out to be partially Gaussian functions with free
  behavior along the null directions of $B$.
  Building on this framework, we extend the Beurling-H\"ormander theorem to the metaplectic
  setting, obtaining a precise polynomial-Gaussian structure for functions satisfying suitable
  exponential integrability conditions involving both $f$ and its metaplectic transform. Finally,
  we prove a Morgan-type (or Gel'fand--Shilov type) uncertainty principle for metaplectic operators,
  identifying a sharp threshold separating triviality from density of admissible functions and
  showing that this threshold is invariant under metaplectic transformations.
  Our results recover the classical Fourier case and free metaplectic transformations as special
  instances, and reveal the geometric and anisotropic nature of uncertainty principles in the
  presence of symplectic degeneracies.</description>

      <title>The Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection and Kontsevich-Soibelman operations on the periodic cyclic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant operations on the periodic cyclic homology of a dg algebra that arise from the chain level action of the two-colored Kontsevich-Soibelman operad. Using classical computations of Cohen [Coh], we explicitly compute a set of generators for these operations under composition, and show that they agree with the p-fold equivariant cap products previously studied by the author [Che2] in relation to equivariant Gromov-Witten theory with mod p coefficients. The main technical novelty is a re-formulation of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operad in terms of a two-colored version of the cacti operad, and a proof that it is equivariantly quasi-equivalent to the two-colored operad of little disks on a disk/cylinder. We give applications of the main results to symplectic topology, and more specifically, arithmetic aspects of Fukaya category and classical obstructions to realizing a middle cohomology class of a symplectic manifold by Lagrangian submanifold</description>

      <title>Length spectrum rigidity and flexibility of spheres of revolution with one equator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of marked length spectrum for $S^1$-symmetric Riemannian metrics on the two-sphere having only one equator. We prove that isospectral metrics in this class have conjugate geodesic flows. Under a further $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry assumption, we show that the marked length spectrum determines the metric. Finally, we show that every isospectral class of metrics contains a unique $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric metric and give an explicit description of this isospectral class as an infinite dimensional convex set, generalizing the known description of $S^1$-symmetric Zoll metrics. This paper contains also two appendices, in which we provide an elementary proof of the fact that a $C^2$ real valued function on an interval is determined by the set of tangent lines to its graph, and we classify a class of $S^1$-invariant contact forms on three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Foundations of $(A_\infty,2)$-categories: from flow to linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a blueprint for the construction of a symplectic $(A_\infty,2)$-category, $\mathsf{Symp}$. We develop two ways of encoding the information in $\mathsf{Symp}$ -- one topological, one algebraic. The topological encoding is as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category, which we define here. The algebraic encoding is as a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category, which we extract from the topological encoding. In upcoming work, we plan to use the adiabatic Fredholm theory developed by us to construct $\mathsf{Symp}$ as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category, which thus induces a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category.
  The notion of a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category developed here goes beyond the proposal of Bottman and Carmeli. The recursive structure of the 2-associahedra identifies faces with fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra, which led Bottman and Carmeli to associate operations to singular chains on 2-associahedra. The innovation in our new definition of linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category is to extend the family of 2-associahedra to include all fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra. This allows us to associate operations to cellular chains, which in particular enables us to produce a definition that involves only one operation in each arity, governed by a collection of $(A_\infty,2)$-equations.</description>

      <title>Oka and Alexander polynomials of symplectic curves and divisibility relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Libgober's divisibility relations for Oka and Alexander polynomials of symplectic curves in the complex projective plane. Along the way, we give new proofs of the divisibility relations for the Alexander polynomials of complex algebraic curves with respect to a generic line at infinity.</description>
