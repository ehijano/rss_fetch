      <title>Multifractality and its sources in the digital currency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifractality in time series analysis characterizes the presence of multiple scaling exponents, indicating heterogeneous temporal structures and complex dynamical behaviors beyond simple monofractal models. In the context of digital currency markets, multifractal properties arise due to the interplay of long-range temporal correlations and heavy-tailed distributions of returns, reflecting intricate market microstructure and trader interactions. Incorporating multifractal analysis into the modeling of cryptocurrency price dynamics enhances the understanding of market inefficiencies, may improve volatility forecasting and facilitate the detection of critical transitions or regime shifts. Based on the multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MFCCA) whose spacial case is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical tools for quantifying multifractality, in the present contribution a recently proposed method of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series was applied to the most representative instruments from the digital market. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), decentralized exchanges (DEX) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The results indicate the significant role of heavy tails in generating a broad multifractal spectrum. However, they also clearly demonstrate that the primary source of multifractality are temporal correlations in the series, and without them, multifractality fades out. It appears characteristic that these temporal correlations, to a large extent, do not depend on the thickness of the tails of the fluctuation distribution. These observations, made here in the context of the digital currency market, provide a further strong argument for the validity of the proposed methodology of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Variance of Market Portfolio and of Entire Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the unified market-based description of returns and variances of the trades with shares of a particular security, of the trades with shares of all securities in the market, and of the trades with the market portfolio. We consider the investor who doesn't trade the shares of his portfolio he collected at time t0 in the past. The investor observes the time series of the current trades with all securities made in the market during the averaging interval. The investor may convert these time series into the time series that model the trades with all securities as the trades with a single security and into the time series that model the trades with the market portfolio as the trades with a single security. That establishes the same description of the returns and variances of the trades with a single security, the trades with all securities in the market, and the market portfolio. We show that the market-based variance, which accounts for the impact of random change of the volumes of consecutive trades with securities, takes the form of Markowitz's (1952) portfolio variance if the volumes of consecutive trades with all market securities are assumed constant. That highlights that Markowitz's (1952) variance ignores the effects of random volumes of consecutive trades. We compare the market-based variances of the market portfolio and of the trades with all market securities, consider the importance of the duration of the averaging interval, and explain the economic obstacles that limit the accuracy of the predictions of the returns and variances at best by Gaussian distributions. The same methods describe the returns and variances of any portfolio and the trades with its securities.</description>
