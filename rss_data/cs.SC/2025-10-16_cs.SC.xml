      <title>Complete Reduction for Derivatives in a Primitive Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete reduction $\phi$ for derivatives in a differential field is a linear operator on the field over its constant subfield. The reduction enables us to decompose an element $f$ as the sum of a derivative and the remainder $\phi(f)$. A direct application of $\phi$ is that $f$ is in-field integrable if and only if $\phi(f) = 0.$
  In this paper, we present a complete reduction for derivatives in a primitive tower algorithmically. Typical examples for primitive towers are differential fields generated by (poly-)logarithmic functions and logarithmic integrals. Using remainders and residues, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for an element from a primitive tower to have an elementary integral, and discuss how to construct telescopers for non-D-finite functions in some special primitive towers.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Debordering Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Border complexity captures functions that can be approximated by low-complexity ones. Debordering is the task of proving an upper bound on some non-border complexity measure in terms of a border complexity measure, thus getting rid of limits. Debordering lies at the heart of foundational complexity theory questions relating Valiant's determinant versus permanent conjecture (1979) and its geometric complexity theory (GCT) variant proposed by Mulmuley and Sohoni (2001). The debordering of matrix multiplication tensors by Bini (1980) played a pivotal role in the development of efficient matrix multiplication algorithms. Consequently, debordering finds applications in both establishing computational complexity lower bounds and facilitating algorithm design. Recent years have seen notable progress in debordering various restricted border complexity measures. In this survey, we highlight these advances and discuss techniques underlying them.</description>

      <title>MiGumi: Making Tightly Coupled Integral Joints Millable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional integral wood joints, despite their strength, durability, and elegance, remain rare in modern workflows due to the cost and difficulty of manual fabrication. CNC milling offers a scalable alternative, but directly milling traditional joints often fails to produce functional results because milling induces geometric deviations, such as rounded inner corners, that alter the target geometries of the parts. Since joints rely on tightly fitting surfaces, such deviations introduce gaps or overlaps that undermine fit or block assembly. We propose to overcome this problem by (1) designing a language that represent millable geometry, and (2) co-optimizing part geometries to restore coupling. We introduce Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG), a language for representing geometry as the outcome of milling operations performed with flat-end drill bits. MXG represents each operation as a subtractive extrusion volume defined by a tool direction and drill radius. This parameterization enables the modeling of artifact-free geometry under an idealized zero-radius drill bit, matching traditional joint designs. Increasing the radius then reveals milling-induced deviations, which compromise the integrity of the joint. To restore coupling, we formalize tight coupling in terms of both surface proximity and proximity constraints on the mill-bit paths associated with mating surfaces. We then derive two tractable, differentiable losses that enable efficient optimization of joint geometry. We evaluate our method on 30 traditional joint designs, demonstrating that it produces CNC-compatible, tightly fitting joints that approximates the original geometry. By reinterpreting traditional joints for CNC workflows, we continue the evolution of this heritage craft and help ensure its relevance in future making practices.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Reachability Analysis for Rectangular Automata with Random Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents optimizations to improve the scalability of reachability analysis on a subclass of hybrid automata extended with stochasticity. The optimizations target different components of the analysis, such as quantifier elimination for state set projection, and automated parameter selection during the numerical integration. Most importantly, whereas the original method combines forward and backward reachability, we show that the usage of backward reachability is optional for computing maximal reachability probabilities.</description>
