      <title>Pathfinding of Digital False Information Diffusion by Conformal Field Theory and Feynman's Green's Function: Multiple Analysis Considering Stress Energy Tensor and Symmetry of Virasoro Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the application of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) to understand information diffusion within digital media and its broader social implications. Focusing on the digital native generation, vulnerable to misinformation and data privacy issues, the research highlights the urgency of addressing psychological health in the digital realm. By leveraging CFT's analytical power, particularly in tracing information flows and assessing the impact of misinformation, the study offers novel insights into the dynamics of digital communication. It proposes a model for predicting and analyzing the spread of biased content, emphasizing the need for improved information literacy and personal data protection. This paper explores the concept of infinitesimal conformal transformations using the Virasoro operator, forming a conformal transformation group. In the examination of multiple analytical methods, the approach to quantitatively analyze cases that are likely to expose the risk of spreading filter bubbles such as negative information, rumors, and fake news is to incorporate a two-dimensional conformal field theory approach using the Ward-Takahashi identity and path integral with trace anomalies and metric are introduced. Trace anomalies and metrics were introduced. A trace anomaly refers to the spread of information in an unexpected way, usually indicating anomalous behavior or hidden dynamics in the system. Metric variation hypothesized and analyzed how diffusion characteristics, such as the rate and pattern of information diffusion, vary over time.</description>

      <title>Discussion of Loop Expansion and Introduction of Series Cutting Functions to Local Potential Approximation: Complexity Analysis Using Green's Functions, Cutting Of Nth-Order Social Interactions For Progressive Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the aforementioned paper, "Examination Kubo-Matsubara Green's Function Of The Edwards-Anderson Model: Extreme Value Information Flow Of Nth-Order Interpolated Extrapolation Of Zero Phenomena Using The Replica Method (2024)". This paper also applies theoretical physics methods to better understand the filter bubble phenomenon, focusing in particular on loop expansions and truncation functions. Using the loop expansion method, the complexity of social interactions during the occurrence of filter bubbles will be discussed in order to introduce series, express mathematically, and evaluate the impact of these interactions. We analyze the interactions between agents and their time evolution using a variety of Green's functions, including delayed Green's functions, advanced Green's functions, and causal Green's functions, to capture the dynamic response of the system through local potential approximations. In addition, we apply truncation functions and truncation techniques to ensure incremental safety and evaluate the long-term stability of the system. This approach will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of filter bubble generation and dissolution, and discuss insights into their prevention and management. This research explores the possibilities of applying theoretical physics frameworks to social science problems and examines methods for analyzing the complex dynamics of information flow and opinion formation in digital society.</description>

      <title>The indoor agriculture industry: a promising player in demand response services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand response (DR) programs currently cover about 2\% of the average annual global demand, which is far from contributing to the International Energy Agency's ``Net Zero by 2050'' roadmap's 20\% target. While aggregation of many small flexible loads such as individual households can help reaching this target, increasing the participation of industries that are major electricity consumers is certainly a way forward. The indoor agriculture sector currently experiences a significant growth to partake in the sustainable production of high-quality food world-wide. As energy-related costs, up to 40\% of the total expenses, may preclude full maturity of this industry, DR participation can result in a win-win situation. Indeed, the agriculture system must transform and become a sustainable source of food for an increasing number of people worldwide under the constraints of preservation of soils and water, carbon footprint, and energy efficiency. We considered the case of the Russian Federation where indoor farming is burgeoning and already represents a load of several thousand megawatts. To show the viability of the indoor farming industry participation in implicit and explicit DR programs, we built a physical model of a vertical farm inside a phytotron with complete control of environmental parameters including ambient temperature, relative humidity, CO$_2$ concentration, and photosynthetic photon flux density. This phytotron was used as a model greenhouse. We grew different varieties of leafy plants under simulated DR conditions and control conditions on the same setup. Our results show that the indoor farming dedicated to greens can participate in DR without adversely affecting plant production and that this presents an economic advantage.</description>

      <title>Belief and Persuasion in Scientific Discourse on Social Media: A Study of the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research into COVID-19 has been rapidly evolving since the onset of the pandemic. This occasionally results in contradictory recommendations by credible sources of scientific opinion, public health authorities, and medical professionals. In this study, we examine whether this has resulted in a lack of trust in scientific opinion, by examining the belief patterns of social media users and their reactions to statements related to scientific facts. We devise models to mine belief and persuasion in Twitter discourse using semi-supervised approaches, and show the relationship between lack of belief and insurgence of paranoia and conspiracy theories. By investigating these belief patterns, we explore the best persuasion tactics for communicating information related to COVID-19.</description>

      <title>From Pro, Anti to Informative and Hesitant: An Infoveillance study of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination discourse on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the world, and vaccination has been a key strategy to combat the disease. Since Twitter is one of the most widely used public microblogging platforms, researchers have analysed COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination Twitter discourse to explore the conversational dynamics around the topic. While contributing to the crisis informatics literature, we curate a large-scale geotagged Twitter dataset, GeoCovaxTweets Extended, and explore the discourse through multiple spatiotemporal analyses. This dataset covers a longer time span of 38 months, from the announcement of the first vaccine to the availability of booster doses. Results show that 43.4% of the collected tweets, although containing phrases and keywords related to vaccines and vaccinations, were unrelated to the COVID-19 context. In total, 23.1% of the discussions on vaccines and vaccinations were classified as Pro, 16% as Hesitant, 11.4% as Anti, and 6.1% as Informative. The trend shifted towards Pro and Informative tweets globally as vaccination programs progressed, indicating a change in the public's perception of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination. Furthermore, we explored the discourse based on account attributes, i.e., followers counts and tweet counts. Results show a significant pattern of discourse differences. Our findings highlight the potential of harnessing a large-scale geotagged Twitter dataset to understand global public health communication and to inform targeted interventions aimed at addressing vaccine hesitancy.</description>

      <title>Renewable levelized cost of energy available for export: An indicator for exploring global renewable energy trade potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renewable energy resources are widely available, yet they are unevenly distributed globally. In a renewable future, countries lacking high-quality renewable resources may choose to import energy from other countries. To assess the resource-dependent and techno-economic basis for global renewable energy trade and identify potential importers and exporters, this study introduces two new metrics: Renewable Levelized Cost of Energy available for Export (RLCOE_Ex) and Potential Energy Export Volume (PEEV). These metrics are computed based on regional resource potential, domestic energy demand and varying financial costs across countries, without the need for any energy system modeling. By applying these two metrics to 165 countries/regions, we identify countries with significant potential for exporting renewable energy (e.g., the US, China) and those that lack the domestic resources to satisfy demand (e.g., South Korea, Japan). The RLCOE_Ex and PEEV metrics are validated through a separate analysis, employing a comprehensive energy system model for each country/region.</description>

      <title>Towards Standardized Grid Emission Factors: Methodological Insights and Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inconsistent calculation of grid emission factors (EF) can result in widely divergent corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reports. We dissect this issue through a comprehensive literature review, identifying nine key aspects - each with two to six methodological choices - that substantially influence the reported EF. These choices lead to relative effect variations ranging from 1.2% to 69%. Using Germany's 2019-2022 data as a case study, our method yields results that largely align with prior studies, yet reveal relative effects from 0.4% to 34.6%. This study is the first to methodically unpack the key determinants of grid EF, quantify their impacts, and offer clear guidelines for their application in corporate GHG accounting. Our findings hold implications for practitioners, data publishers, researchers, and guideline-making organizations. By openly sharing our data and calculations, we invite replication, scrutiny, and further research.</description>

      <title>Criminal organizations exhibit hysteresis, resilience, and robustness by balancing security and efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between criminal organizations and law enforcement disruption strategies is crucial in criminology. Criminal enterprises, like legitimate businesses, balance visibility and security to thrive. This study uses evolutionary game theory to analyze criminal networks' dynamics, resilience to interventions, and responses to external conditions. We find strong hysteresis effects, challenging traditional deterrence-focused strategies. Optimal thresholds for organization formation or dissolution are defined by these effects. Stricter punishment doesn't always deter organized crime linearly. Network structure, particularly link density and skill assortativity, significantly influences organization formation and stability. These insights advocate for adaptive policy-making and strategic law enforcement to effectively disrupt criminal networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk on simplicial complexes for simplicial community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks have emerged as a transformative paradigm in quantum information processing and can be applied to various graph problems. This study explores discrete-time quantum walks on simplicial complexes, a higher-order generalization of graph structures. Simplicial complexes, encoding higher-order interactions through simplices, offer a richer topological representation of complex systems. Leveraging algebraic topology and discrete-time quantum walk, we present a quantum walk algorithm for detecting higher-order community structures called simplicial communities. We utilize the Fourier coin to produce entangled translation states among adjacent simplices in a simplicial complex. The potential of our quantum algorithm is tested on Zachary's karate club network. This study may contribute to understanding complex systems at the intersection of algebraic topology and quantum algorithms.</description>
