      <title>Stabilizer-free Weak Galerkin Methods for Quad-Curl Problems on polyhedral Meshes without Convexity Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient stabilizer-free weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for solving the three-dimensional quad-curl problem. Leveraging bubble functions as a key analytical tool, the method extends the applicability of stabilizer-free WG approaches to non-convex elements in finite element partitions-a notable advancement over existing methods, which are restricted to convex elements. The proposed method maintains a simple, symmetric, and positive definite formulation. It achieves optimal error estimates for the exact solution in a discrete norm, as well as an optimal-order $L^2$ error estimate for $k&gt;2$ and a sub-optimal order for the lowest order case $k=2$. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the method's efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>A combined Lax-Wendroff/interpolation approach with finite element method for a three-dimensional system of tectonic deformation model: application to landslides in Cameroon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an efficient computational technique to assess the landslide responses to tectonic deformation and to predict the implications of large bedrocks landslides on the short and long-term development of the disasters. The considered equations represent a three-dimensional system of geological structure deformation subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. The space derivatives are approximated using the finite element procedure while the approximation in time derivative is obtained using the Lax-Wendroff and interpolation techniques. The new approach is so called a combined Lax-Wendroff/interpolation method with finite element method. The modified Lax-Wendroff/interpolation scheme is employed to efficiently treat the time derivative term and to provide a suitable time step restriction for stability. Under this time step requirement, both stability and error estimates of the new algorithm are deeply analyzed using a constructed strong norm. The theory suggests that the developed computational technique is second-order accurate in time and spatial convergent with order O(h^{p}), where $h$ denotes the space size and p is a positive integer. A wide set of numerical examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and to demonstrate the utility and validity of the proposed numerical scheme. An application to landslides observed in west and center regions in Cameroon from October 2019 to November 2024, are discussed.</description>

      <title>High Order in Space and Time Schemes Through an Approximate Lax-Wendroff Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the scheme proposed by the authors in Zor\'io, Baeza and Mulet (J Sci Comput 71(1):246-273, 2017). This scheme is an alternative to the techniques proposed in Qiu and Shu (SIAM J Sci Comput 24(6):2185-2198, 2003) to obtain high-order accurate schemes using Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory finite differences and approximating the flux derivatives required by the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure by simple centered finite differences. We analyse how errors in first-order terms near discontinuities propagate through both versions of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure. We propose a fluctuation control, for which the approximation of the first-order derivative to be used in the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure is obtained from a Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory (WENO) interpolation of flux derivatives, instead of the usual finite difference of WENO flux reconstructions. The numerical results that we obtain confirm the benefits of this fluctuation control.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous spatial-parametric collocation approximation for parametric PDEs with log-normal random inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proved convergence rates of fully discrete multi-level simultaneous linear collocation approximation of solutions to parametric elliptic PDEs on bounded polygonal domain with log-normal random inputs based on a finite number of their values at points in the spatial-parametric domain. These convergence rates significantly improve the best-known convergence rates of fully discrete collocation approximation and with some logarithm factors coincide with the convergence rates of best $n$-term approximation. These results are obtained as consequences of general results on multi-level linear sampling recovery in abstract Bochner spaces.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection (DAmbrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel method combines a particle filter with reduced variance and solving the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space, exploiting the advantages of both approaches. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>On positivity preservation of hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid finite element methods, particularly hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, are efficient numerical schemes for discretizing the diffusion equation, which encompasses two main physical principles: mass conservation and positivity preservation. While the former has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper investigates the latter. We state a theorem that guarantees the positivity of both the bulk and skeleton approximations to the primary unknown (concentration) and provide counterexamples for nonpositive discretizations. The theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>What is a Sketch-and-Precondition Derivation for Low-Rank Approximation? Inverse Power Error or Inverse Power Estimation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized sketching accelerates large-scale numerical linear algebra by reducing computa- tional complexity. While the traditional sketch-and-solve approach reduces the problem size di- rectly through sketching, the sketch-and-precondition method leverages sketching to construct a computational friendly preconditioner. This preconditioner improves the convergence speed of iterative solvers applied to the original problem, maintaining accuracy in the full space. Further- more, the convergence rate of the solver improves at least linearly with the sketch size. Despite its potential, developing a sketch-and-precondition framework for randomized algorithms in low- rank matrix approximation remains an open challenge. We introduce the Error-Powered Sketched Inverse Iteration (EPSI) Method via run sketched Newton iteration for the Lagrange form as a sketch-and-precondition variant for randomized low-rank approximation. Our method achieves theoretical guarantees, including a convergence rate that improves at least linearly with the sketch size.</description>

      <title>Finite difference alternative WENO schemes with Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decompositions for compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are widely used for hyperbolic conservation laws due to the ability to resolve discontinuities and maintain high-order accuracy in smooth regions at the same time. For hyperbolic systems, the WENO procedure is usually performed on local characteristic variables that are obtained by local characteristic decompositions to avoid oscillation near shocks. However, such decompositions are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we study a Riemann invariant-based local characteristic decomposition for the compressible Euler equations that reduces the cost. We apply the WENO procedure to the local characteristic fields of the Riemann invariants, where the eigenmatrix is sparse and thus the computational cost can be reduced. It is difficult to obtain the cell averages of Riemann invariants from those of the conserved variables due to the nonlinear relation between them, so we only focus on the finite difference alternative WENO versions. The efficiency and non-oscillatory property of the proposed schemes are well demonstrated by our numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an industrial group like Safran, numerical simulations of physical phenomena are integral to most design processes. At Safran's corporate research center, we enhance these processes by developing fast and reliable surrogate models for various physics. We focus here on two technologies developed in recent years. The first is a physical reduced-order modeling method for non-linear structural mechanics and thermal analysis, used for calculating the lifespan of high-pressure turbine blades and performing heat analysis of high-pressure compressors. The second technology involves learning physics simulations with non-parameterized geometrical variability using classical machine learning tools, such as Gaussian process regression. Finally, we present our contributions to the open-source and open-data community.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error control for a finite volume scheme for a cross-diffusion model of ion transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a reliable a posteriori error estimate for a cell-centered finite volume scheme approximating a cross-diffusion system modeling ion transport through nanopores. To this end we derive an abstract stability framework that is independent of the numerical scheme and introduce a suitable (conforming) reconstruction of the numerical solution. The stability framework relies on some simplifying assumption that coincide with those made in weak uniqueness results for this system. This is the first a posteriori error estimate for a cross-diffusion system. Along the way, we derive a pointwise a posteriori error estimate for a finite volume scheme approximating the diffusion equation. We conduct numerical experiments showing that the error estimator scales with the same order as the true error.</description>

      <title>Space-time parallel iterative solvers for the integration of parabolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the existing limitations of sequential computing, parallelization has emerged as an alternative in order to improve the speedup of numerical simulations. In the framework of evolutionary problems, space-time parallel methods offer the possibility to optimize parallelization. In the present paper, we propose a new family of these methods, built as a combination of the well-known parareal algorithm and suitable splitting techniques which permit us to parallelize in space. In particular, dimensional and domain decomposition splittings are considered for partitioning the elliptic operator, and first-order splitting time integrators are chosen as the propagators of the parareal algorithm to solve the resulting split problem. The major contribution of these methods is that, not only does the fine propagator perform in parallel, but also the coarse propagator. Unlike the classical version of the parareal algorithm, where all processors remain idle during the coarse propagator computations, the newly proposed schemes utilize the computational cores for both integrators. A convergence analysis of the methods is provided, and several numerical experiments are performed to test the solvers under consideration.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Variable-separation Method for Parameter-dependent Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamical Variable-separation method for solving parameter-dependent dynamical systems. To achieve this, we establish a dynamical low-rank approximation for the solutions of these dynamical systems by successively enriching each term in the reduced basis functions via a greedy algorithm. This enables us to reformulate the problem to two decoupled evolution equations at each enrichment step, of which one is a parameter-independent partial differential equation and the other one is a parameter-dependent ordinary differential equation. These equations are directly derived from the original dynamical system and the previously separate representation terms. Moreover, the computational process of the proposed method can be split into an offline stage, in which the reduced basis functions are constructed, and an online stage, in which the efficient low-rank representation of the solution is employed. The proposed dynamical Variable-separation method is capable of offering reduced computational complexity and enhanced efficiency compared to many existing low-rank separation techniques. Finally, we present various numerical results for linear/nonlinear parameter-dependent dynamical systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Numerical Schemes for Signature Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signature kernels have emerged as a powerful tool within kernel methods for sequential data. In the paper "The Signature Kernel is the solution of a Goursat PDE", the authors identify a kernel trick that demonstrates that, for continuously differentiable paths, the signature kernel satisfies a Goursat problem for a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two independent time variables. While finite difference methods have been explored for this PDE, they face limitations in accuracy and stability when handling highly oscillatory inputs. In this work, we introduce two advanced numerical schemes that leverage polynomial representations of boundary conditions through either approximation or interpolation techniques, and rigorously establish the theoretical convergence of the polynomial approximation scheme. Experimental evaluations reveal that our approaches yield improvements of several orders of magnitude in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to traditional finite difference schemes, without increasing computational complexity. Furthermore, like finite difference methods, our algorithms can be GPU-parallelized to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the length of the input sequences, thereby improving scalability for high-frequency data. We have implemented these algorithms in a dedicated Python library, which is publicly available at: https://github.com/FrancescoPiatti/polysigkernel.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review of Analytical and Numerical Approaches in Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers and Exergoeconomic Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers (EAHEs), also known as underground air ducts, have garnered significant attention for their ability to provide energy-efficient cooling and heating solutions while maintaining a minimal environmental footprint. These systems leverage the relatively stable underground temperature to regulate indoor climates, reducing reliance on conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This review systematically categorizes and synthesizes research on EAHEs into three primary areas: analytical, numerical, and exergoeconomic studies. Analytical approaches focus on developing theoretical models to predict thermal performance, while numerical simulations provide insights into system optimization and real-world applications. Exergoeconomic analyses, integrating thermodynamic efficiency with economic considerations, offer valuable perspectives on cost-effectiveness and long-term viability. By consolidating existing contributions across these domains, this study serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers seeking to enhance the design, implementation, and performance of EAHE systems. The findings emphasize the pivotal role of EAHEs in reducing energy consumption, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving economic sustainability. Additionally, this review identifies key challenges, including soil thermal conductivity variations, moisture effects, and system integration with renewable energy sources, which require further investigation. By addressing these challenges, EAHEs can be further optimized to serve as a cornerstone in sustainable energy management, contributing to global efforts toward energy-efficient building solutions and climate change mitigation.</description>

      <title>Projection Methods in the Context of Nematic Crystal Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuous and a discontinuous linear Finite Element method based on a predictor-corrector scheme for the numerical approximation of the Ericksen-Leslie equations, a model for nematic liquid crystal flow including a non-convex unit-sphere constraint. As predictor step we propose a linear semi-implicit Finite Element discretization which naturally offers a local orthogonality relation between the approximate director field and its time derivative. Afterwards an explicit discrete projection onto the unit-sphere constraint is applied without increasing the modeled energy. For the Finite Element approximation of the director field, we compare the usage of a discrete inner product, usually referred to as mass-lumping, for a globally continuous, piecewise linear discretization to a piecewise constant, discontinuous Galerkin approach. Discrete well-posedness results and energy laws are established. Conditional convergence of the approximate solutions to energy-variational solutions of the Ericksen-Leslie equations is shown for a time-step restriction, see Theorems 1 and 2. Computational studies indicate the efficiency of the proposed linearization and the improved accuracy by including a projection step in the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic modelling of a skin effect in magnetic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell equations set on a domain made of two subdomains $\Omega_{-}$ and $\Omega_{+}$, such that $\Omega_{-}$ represents a magnetic conductor and $\Omega_{+}$ represents a non-magnetic material, and the relative magnetic permeability $\mu_{r}$ between the two materials is very high. Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains and regularity of the data, the electric field solution of the Maxwell equations possesses an asymptotic expansion in powers of the parameter $\eps=1/ \sqrt{\mu_{r}}$ with profile terms rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor. We make explicit the first terms of this expansion. As an application of the asymptotic expansion we obtain the asymptotic behavior of a skin depth function that allows to measure the boundary layer phenomenon at large relative permeability. As another application of this expansion we give elements of proof for the derivation of impedance boundary conditions (IBCs) up to the third order of approximation with respect to the parameter $\varepsilon$, and we prove error estimates for the IBCs.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$: package for numerical computation of Lauricella functions depending on a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, a computational tool developed in Wolfram Mathematica for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions with indices linearly dependent on a parameter, $\varepsilon$. The package leverages a method based on analytical continuation via Frobenius generalized power series, providing an efficient and accurate alternative to conventional approaches relying on multi-dimensional series expansions or Mellin--Barnes representations. This one-dimensional approach is particularly advantageous for high-precision calculations and facilitates further optimization through $\varepsilon$-dependent reconstruction from evaluations at specific numerical values, enabling efficient parallelization. The underlying mathematical framework for this method has been detailed in our previous work, while the current paper focuses on the design, implementation, and practical applications of the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Kronecker Matrix-Vector Complexity of Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08029v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational model where we can access a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ only by computing matrix-vector products $\mathbf{A}\mathrm{x}$ for vectors of the form $\mathrm{x} = \mathrm{x}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{x}_q$. We prove exponential lower bounds on the number of queries needed to estimate various properties, including the trace and the top eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}$. Our proofs hold for all adaptive algorithms, modulo a mild conditioning assumption on the algorithm's queries. We further prove that algorithms whose queries come from a small alphabet (e.g., $\mathrm{x}_i \in \{\pm1\}^n$) cannot test if $\mathbf{A}$ is identically zero with polynomial complexity, despite the fact that a single query using Gaussian vectors solves the problem with probability 1. In steep contrast to the non-Kronecker case, this shows that sketching $\mathbf{A}$ with different distributions of the same subguassian norm can yield exponentially different query complexities. Our proofs follow from the observation that random vectors with Kronecker structure have exponentially smaller inner products than their non-Kronecker counterparts.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of ESPRIT with Preconditioned First-Order Methods for Spike Deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spike deconvolution is the problem of recovering point sources from their convolution with a known point spread function, playing a fundamental role in many sensing and imaging applications. This paper proposes a novel approach combining ESPRIT with Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) to estimate the amplitudes and locations of the point sources by a non-linear least squares. The preconditioning matrices are adaptively designed to account for variations in the learning process, ensuring a proven super-linear convergence rate. We provide local convergence guarantees for PGD and performance analysis of ESPRIT reconstruction, leading to global convergence guarantees for our method in one-dimensional settings with multiple snapshots, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Numerical simulations corroborate the performance of the proposed approach for spike deconvolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of ultrasound is well established in the imaging of human tissue. In order to enhance image quality by exploiting nonlinear effects, recently techniques such as harmonic imaging and nonlinearity parameter tomography have been put forward. As soon as the pressure amplitude exceeds a certain bound, the classical linear wave equation loses its validity and more general nonlinear versions have to be used. Another characteristic property of ultrasound propagation in human tissue is frequency power law attenuation, leading to fractional derivative damping models in time domain. In this contribution we will first of all dwell on modeling nonlinearity on the one hand and fractional damping on the other hand. Moreover we will give an idea on the challenges in the analysis of the resulting PDEs and discuss some parameter asymptotics. Finally, we address a relevant inverse problems in this context, the above mentioned task of nonlinearity parameter imaging, which leads to a coefficient identification problem for a quasilinear wave equation.</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstruction is absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalization. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Improving sampling efficacy on high dimensional distributions with thin high density regions using Conservative Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is a prominent Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which employs symplectic integrators to sample from high dimensional target distributions in many applications, such as statistical mechanics, Bayesian statistics and generative models. However, such distributions tend to have thin high density regions, posing a significant challenge for symplectic integrators to maintain the small energy errors needed for a high acceptance probability. Instead, we propose a variant called Conservative Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, using $R$--reversible energy-preserving integrators to retain a high acceptance probability. We show our algorithm can achieve approximate stationarity with an error determined by the Jacobian approximation of the energy-preserving proposal map. Numerical evidence shows improved convergence and robustness over integration parameters on target distributions with thin high density regions and in high dimensions. Moreover, a version of our algorithm can also be applied to target distributions without gradient information.</description>

      <title>A provably stable numerical method for the anisotropic diffusion equation in confined magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving the anisotropic diffusion equation in magnetic fields confined to a periodic box which is accurate and provably stable. We derive energy estimates of the solution of the continuous initial boundary value problem. A discrete formulation is presented using operator splitting in time with the summation by parts finite difference approximation of spatial derivatives for the perpendicular diffusion operator. Weak penalty procedures are derived for implementing both boundary conditions and parallel diffusion operator obtained by field line tracing. We prove that the fully-discrete approximation is unconditionally stable. Discrete energy estimates are shown to match the continuous energy estimate given the correct choice of penalty parameters. A nonlinear penalty parameter is shown to provide an effective method for tuning the parallel diffusion penalty and significantly minimises rounding errors. Several numerical experiments, using manufactured solutions, the ``NIMROD benchmark'' problem and a single island problem, are presented to verify numerical accuracy, convergence, and asymptotic preserving properties of the method. Finally, we present a magnetic field with chaotic regions and islands and show the contours of the anisotropic diffusion equation reproduce key features in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that provides approximate solutions to semi-linear ordinary differential equations with highly oscillatory solutions, which, after an appropriate change of variables, can be rewritten as non-autonomous systems with a $(2\pi/\omega)$-periodic dependence on $t$. The proposed approximate solutions are given in closed form as functions $X(\omega t,t)$, where $X(\theta,t)$ is (i) a truncated Fourier series in $\theta$ for fixed $t$ and (ii) a truncated Taylor series in $t$ for fixed $\theta$, which motivates the name of the method.
  These approximations are uniformly accurate in $\omega$, meaning that their accuracy does not degrade as $\omega \to \infty$. In addition, Taylor-Fourier approximations enable the computation of high-order averaging equations for the original semi-linear system, as well as related maps that are particularly useful in the highly oscillatory regime (i.e., for sufficiently large $\omega$).
  The main goal of this paper is to develop an efficient procedure for computing such approximations by combining truncated power series arithmetic with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We present numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including applications to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with non-smooth initial data and a perturbed Kepler problem from satellite orbit dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose activation functions for neuronal networks that are refinable and sum the identity. This new class of activation functions allows the insertion of new layers between existing ones and/or the increase of neurons in a layer, both without altering the network outputs.
  Our approach is grounded in subdivision theory. The proposed activation functions are constructed from basic limit functions of convergent subdivision schemes. As a showcase of our results, we introduce a family of spline activation functions and provide comprehensive details for their practical implementation.</description>

      <title>A Least-Squares-Based Neural Network (LS-Net) for Solving Linear Parametric PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing efficient methods for solving parametric partial differential equations is crucial for addressing inverse problems. This work introduces a Least-Squares-based Neural Network (LS-Net) method for solving linear parametric PDEs. It utilizes a separated representation form for the parametric PDE solution via a deep neural network and a least-squares solver. In this approach, the output of the deep neural network consists of a vector-valued function, interpreted as basis functions for the parametric solution space, and the least-squares solver determines the optimal solution within the constructed solution space for each given parameter. The LS-Net method requires a quadratic loss function for the least-squares solver to find optimal solutions given the set of basis functions. In this study, we consider loss functions derived from the Deep Fourier Residual and Physics-Informed Neural Networks approaches. We also provide theoretical results similar to the Universal Approximation Theorem, stating that there exists a sufficiently large neural network that can theoretically approximate solutions of parametric PDEs with the desired accuracy. We illustrate the LS-net method by solving one- and two-dimensional problems. Numerical results clearly demonstrate the method's ability to approximate parametric solutions.</description>

      <title>A theoretical study on the effect of mass lumping on the discrete frequencies in immersogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In structural dynamics, mass lumping techniques are commonly employed for improving the efficiency of explicit time integration schemes and increasing their critical time step constrained by the largest discrete frequency of the system. For immersogeometric methods, Leidinger \cite{leidinger2020explicit} first showed in 2020 that for sufficiently smooth spline discretizations, the largest frequency was not affected by small trimmed elements if the mass matrix was lumped. This finding was later supported by independent numerical studies. This article provides a rigorous theoretical analysis aimed at unraveling this property. By combining linear algebra with functional analysis, we derive sharp analytical estimates capturing the behavior of the largest discrete frequency for lumped mass approximations and various trimming configurations. Our estimates are then confirmed numerically for 1D and 2D problems.</description>

      <title>A Shifted Boundary Method for Thermal Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an incomplete Octree mesh implementation of the Shifted Boundary Method (Octree-SBM) for multiphysics simulations of coupled flow and heat transfer. Specifically, a semi-implicit formulation of the thermal Navier-Stokes equations is used to accelerate the simulations while maintaining accuracy. The SBM enables precise enforcement of field and derivative boundary conditions on cut (intercepted) elements, allowing for accurate flux calculations near complex geometries, when using non-boundary fitted meshes. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are implemented within the SBM framework, with results demonstrating that the SBM ensures precise enforcement of Neumann boundary conditions on Octree-based meshes. We illustrate this approach by simulating flows across different regimes, spanning several orders of magnitude in both the Rayleigh number ($Ra \sim 10^3$--$10^9$) and the Reynolds number ($Re \sim 10^0$--$10^4$), and covering the laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. Coupled thermal-flow phenomena and their statistics across all these regimes are accurately captured without any additional numerical treatments, beyond a Residual-based Variational Multiscale formulation (RB-VMS). This approach offers a reliable and efficient solution for complex geometries, boundary conditions and flow regimes in computational multiphysics simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a mesh-independent, data-driven library, chebgreen, to mathematically model one-dimensional systems, possessing an associated control parameter, and whose governing partial differential equation is unknown. The proposed method learns an Empirical Green's Function for the associated, but hidden, boundary value problem, in the form of a Rational Neural Network from which we subsequently construct a bivariate representation in a Chebyshev basis. We uncover the Green's function, at an unseen control parameter value, by interpolating the left and right singular functions within a suitable library, expressed as points on a manifold of Quasimatrices, while the associated singular values are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.</description>
