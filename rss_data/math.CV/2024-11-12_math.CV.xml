      <title>Sendov conjecture, Borcea variance conjectures and Schoenberg inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F(z)=\prod\limits_{k=1}^n(z-z_k)$ be a monic complex polynomial of degree $n$. In 1998, Pawlowski [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 350 (1998)] studied the radius $\gamma_n$ of the smallest concentric disk with center at $\tfrac{\sum_{k=1}^nz_k}{n}$ contained at least one critical point of $F(z)$. He showed that $\gamma_n\le \tfrac{2n^\frac{1}{n-1}}{n^\frac{2}{n-1}+1}$. In this paper, we refine Pawlowski's result in the spirit of Borcea variance conjectures and classic Schoenberg inequality, specifically, we show that $\gamma_n\le\sqrt{\tfrac{n-2}{n-1}}$ in a very concise manner. Moreover, we obtain various generalizations of Schoenberg inequalities based on classic Schoenberg inequality including refining Lin-Xie-Zhang's result [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 502 (2021)], which is inspired by the author's recent work on Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities [arXiv:2410.21961] . Finally, we make $D$-companion matrix introduced by Cheung-Ng [Linear Algebra Appl. 432 (2010)] and operator inequalities involved Schatten $p$-norm react so that we provide an additional relationship between the zeros of $F(z)$ and its critical points in the case where all $z_k\ge 0$, which can be regarded as complements of Schmeisser's result [Comput. Methods Funct. Theory 3 (2003)]. By operator parallelogram law, we also prove Sendov conjecture with a condition that depends only on $\Re \tfrac{\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}z_k}{n-1}$.</description>

      <title>A Derivative-Hilbert operator acting on BMOA space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on the interval $[0,1)$. The Hankel matrix $\mathcal{H}_{\mu}=(\mu_{n,k})_{n,k\geq 0}$ with entries $\mu_{n,k}=\mu_{n+k}$, where $\mu_{n}=\int_{[0,1)}t^nd\mu(t)$, induces, formally, the Derivative-Hilbert operator $$\mathcal{DH}_\mu(f)(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty \mu_{n,k}a_k\right)(n+1)z^n , ~z\in \mathbb{D},$$ where $f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n$ is an analytic function in $\mathbb{D}$. We characterize the measures $\mu$ for which $\mathcal{DH}_\mu$ is a bounded operator on $BMOA$ space. We also study the analogous problem from the $\alpha$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}_\alpha(\alpha&gt;0)$ into the $BMOA$ space.</description>

      <title>Gromov hyperbolicity of intrinsic metrics from isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Gromov hyperbolicity of the classical Kobayashi and Hilbert metrics, and the recently introduced minimal metric. Using the linear isoperimetric inequality characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity, we show if these metrics have an "expanding property" near the boundary, then they are Gromov hyperbolic. This provides a new characterization of the convex domains whose Hilbert metric is Gromov hyperbolic, a new proof of Balogh-Bonk's result that the Kobayashi metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a strongly pseudoconvex domain, a new proof of the second author's result that the Kobayashi metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a convex domain with finite type, and a new proof of Fiacchi's result that the minimal metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a strongly minimally convex domain. We also characterize the smoothly bounded convex domains where the minimal metric is Gromov hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>A solution to Fujita's freeness conjecture via an extension theorem with analytic adjoint ideal sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective freeness in Fujita's conjecture states that, for an ample line bundle $L$ on a complex projective manifold $X$, the adjoint bundle $K_X\otimes L^{\otimes m}$ is globally generated when $m \geq \dim_{\mathbb C} X + 1$. Following the approach of Angehrn and Siu, a solution is provided in this paper via the use of adjoint ideal sheaves, which provide a finer control of the non-integrable loci given by multiplier ideal sheaves, so that one can work directly with the lc singularities and the associated (minimal) lc centres as in the algebraic approaches of Kawamata and Helmke. The substitute for the Nadel or Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem used in previous approaches is an extension theorem based on the techniques developed for the injectivity theorems.</description>

      <title>Almansi-type decomposition for slice regular functions of several quaternionic variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06072v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an Almansi-type decomposition for slice regular functions of several quaternionic variables. Our method yields $2^n$ distinct and unique decompositions for any slice function with domain in $\mathbb{H}^n$. Depending on the choice of the decomposition, every component is given explicitly, uniquely determined and exhibits desirable properties, such as harmonicity and circularity in the selected variables. As consequences of these decompositions, we give another proof of Fueter's Theorem in $\mathbb{H}^n$, establish the biharmonicity of slice regular functions in every variable and derive mean value and Poisson formulas for them.</description>

      <title>Partial slice regularity and Fueter's Theorem in several quaternionic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend some definitions and give new results about the theory of slice analysis in several quaternionic variables. The sets of slice functions which are respectively slice, slice regular and circular w.r.t. given variables are characterized. We introduce new notions of partial spherical value and derivative for functions of several variables that extend those of one variable. We recover some of their properties as circularity, harmonicity, some relations with differential operators and a Leibniz rule w.r.t. the slice product as well as studying their behavior in the context of several variables. Then, we prove our main result, which is a generalization of Fueter's Theorem for slice regular functions in several variables. This extends the link between slice regular and axially monogenic functions well known in the one variable context.</description>

      <title>An application of adjoint ideal sheaves to injectivity and extension theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note reviews the authors' approach to Fujino's conjecture, i.e. the injectivity theorem for lc pairs on compact K\"ahler manifolds, via the use of adjoint ideal sheaves coupled with the associated residue computations in their previous work. Using only the techniques and results obtained from that study and under a slightly stronger positivity assumption, a "qualitative" extension result is obtained. Such extension result guarantees the existence of a global holomorphic extension $F$ of any holomorphic section $f$ on some $\sigma$-lc centres of the given lc pair. The extension $F$ can be shown to take values in the corresponding adjoint ideal sheaf, even though it comes without any $L^2$ estimate of $F$ in terms of $f$. Moreover, the proof invokes and implies no vanishing theorem in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture proposed by Berman-Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi, affirming that the Demailly-Lelong number can be determined through a combination of intersection numbers given by the divisorial part of the potential and the SNC divisors over a log resolution of the maximal ideal of a given point. Moreover, this result establishes a pointwise comparison of two different notions of Lelong numbers of plurisubharmonic functions defined on singular complex spaces. We also provide an estimate for quotient singularities and sharp estimates for two-dimensional ADE singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a polynomial $p$ with no zeros in the polydisk, or equivalently the poly-upper half-plane, we study the problem of determining the ideal of polynomials $q$ with the property that the rational function $q/p$ is bounded near a boundary zero of $p$. We give a complete description of this ideal of numerators in the case where the zero set of $p$ is smooth and satisfies a non-degeneracy condition. We also give a description of the ideal in terms of an integral closure when $p$ has an isolated zero on the distinguished boundary. Constructions of multivariate stable polynomials are presented to illustrate sharpness of our results and necessity of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Weighted norm inequalities of various square functions and Volterra integral operators on the unit ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate various square functions on the unit complex ball. We prove the weighted inequalities of the Lusin area integral associated with Poisson integral in terms of $A_p$ weights for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$; this gives an affirmative answer to an open question raised by Segovia and Wheeden. In addition, we get an equivalent characterization of weighted Hardy spaces by means of the Lusin area integral in the context of holomorphic functions. We also obtain the weighted inequalities for Volterra integral operators. The key ingredients of our proof involve complex analysis, Calder\'on-Zygmund theory, the local mean oscillation technique and sparse domination.</description>

      <title>Frequently hypercyclic meromorphic curves with slow growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct entire curves in projective spaces that are simultaneously frequently hypercyclic for translations along countably many specified directions, while preserving optimal slow growth rates. Moreover, we demonstrate that there do not exist entire curves that are frequently hypercyclic for translations along uncountably many directions while still exhibiting optimal slow growth. This result contrasts with the phenomenon observed for hypercyclic entire functions, which can be hypercyclic for translations along uncountably many directions while maintaining slow growth. Our approach is fundamentally grounded in Nevanlinna theory, and the construction is heuristically guided by the Oka principle. This work provides a new perspective on the intricate interplay between the dynamical properties and growth rates of entire curves in projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Versions of the Douglas-Ahlfors Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by ${\mathcal D}$ the open unit disc in the complex plane and $\partial {\mathcal D}$ its boundary. Douglas showed through an identical quantity represented by the Fourier coefficients of the concerned function $u$ that \begin{eqnarray}\label{abs} A(u)=\int_{\mathcal D}|\bigtriangledown U|^2dxdy&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{2\pi}\int\int_{\partial {\mathcal D}\times \partial {\mathcal D}} \left|\frac{u(z_1)-u(z_2)}{z_1-z_2}\right|^2|dz_1||dz_2|,\end{eqnarray} \end{abstract} where $u\in L^2(\partial {\mathcal D}), U$ is the harmonic extension of $u$ into ${\mathcal D}$. Ahlfors gave a fourth equivalence form of $A(u)$ in (\ref{more}) via a different proof. The present article studies relations between the counterpart quantities in higher dimensional spheres with several different but commonly adopted settings, namely, harmonic functions in the Euclidean ${\mathbb R}^n, n\ge 2,$ regular functions in the quaternionic algebra, and Clifford monogenic functions with the real-Clifford algebra ${\mathcal{CL}}_{0, n-1},$ the latter being generated by the multiplication anti-commutative basic imaginary units ${\e}_1, {\e}_2, \cdots , {\e}_{n-1}$ with ${\e}_j^2=-1, j&gt;0.$ It is noted that, while exactly the same equivalence relations hold for harmonic functions in ${\mathbb R}^n$ and regular functions in the quaternionic algebra, for the Clifford algebra setting $n&gt;3,$ the relation (\ref{more}) has to be replaced by essentially a different rule.</description>

Abstract: We present a condition under which the thermal quasi-geostrophic (TQG) model possesses a solution that is holomorphic in time with values in the Gevrey space of complex analytic functions.

      <description>arXiv:2407.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys Campana's theory of C-pairs (or "geometric orbifolds") in the complex-analytic setting, to serve as a reference for future work. Written with a view towards applications in hyperbolicity, rational points, and entire curves, it introduces the fundamental definitions of C-pair-theory systematically. In particular, it establishes an appropriate notion of "morphism", which agrees with notions from the literature in the smooth case, but is better behaved in the singular setting and has functorial properties that relate it to minimal model theory.</description>

It introduces C-semitoric pairs as analogs of the (semi)tori used in the classic Albanese theory and follows Serre by defining the Albanese of a C-pair as the universal map to a C-semitoric pairs. The paper shows that the Albanese exists in relevant cases, gives sharp existence criteria, and conjectures that a "weak Albanese" exists unconditionally.</description>

      <title>Entire curves in C-pairs with large irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the fundamental theorem of Bloch-Ochiai to the context of C-pairs: If (X, D) is a C-pair with large irregularity, then no entire C-curve in X is ever dense. In its most general form, the paper's main theorem applies to normal K\"ahler pairs with arbitrary singularities. However, it also strengthens known results for compact K\"ahler manifolds without boundary, as it applies to some settings that the classic Bloch-Ochiai theorem does not address.
  The proof builds on the work of Kawamata, Ueno, and Noguchi, recasting parabolic Nevanlinna theory as a "Nevanlinna theory for C-pairs". We hope the approach might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Products of two orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operators that are products of two orthogonal projections. Our results complement some of the classical results of Crimmins and von Neumann. Particular emphasis has been given to projections associated with inner functions defined on the polydisc.</description>
