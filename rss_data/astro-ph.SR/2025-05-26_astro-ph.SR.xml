      <title>Probing the origins. II. Unravelling lithium depletion and stellar motion: Intrinsic stellar properties drive depletion, not kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]&gt;0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of WD J004917.14-252556.81, the Most Massive Pulsating White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive follow-up time-series photometry of WD J0049$-$2525, the most massive pulsating white dwarf currently known with $T_{\rm eff} = 13\, 020\,{\rm K}$ and $\log{\it g} = 9.34$ cm s$^{-2}$. The discovery observations detected only two significant pulsation modes. Here, we report the detection of 13 significant pulsation modes ranging from 170 to 258 s based on 11 nights of observations with the New Technology Telescope, Gemini, and Apache Point Observatory telescopes. We use these 13 modes to perform asteroseismology and find that the best-fitting models (under the assumption of an ONe core composition) have $M_{\star} \approx 1.29~M_\odot$, surface hydrogen layer mass of $\log(M_{\rm H}/M_{\star}) \lesssim -7.5$, and a crystallized core fraction of $&gt;99\%$. An analysis of the period spacing also strongly suggests a very high mass. The asteroseismic distance derived is in good agreement with the distance provided by Gaia. We also find tentative evidence of a rotation period of 0.3 or 0.67 d. This analysis provides the first look at the interior of a $\sim 1.3~M_{\odot}$ white dwarf.</description>

      <title>The Backup Program of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Milky Way Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way Backup Program (MWBP), a survey currently underway with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) on the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-m Telescope, works at the margins of the DESI Main surveys to obtain spectra of millions of additional stars from the Gaia catalog. Efficiently utilizing twilight times (&lt;18 deg) and poor weather conditions, the MWBP extends the range of stellar sources studied to both brighter magnitudes and lower Galactic latitude and declination than the stars studied in DESI's Main Milky Way Survey. While the MWBP prioritizes candidate giant stars selected from the Gaia catalog (using color and parallax criteria), it also includes an unbiased sample of bright stars (i.e., 11.2 &lt; G &lt; 16 mag) as well as fainter sources (to G &lt; 19 mag). As of March 1, 2025, the survey had obtained spectra of ~7 million stars, approximately 1.2 million of which are included in the DESI Data Release 1. The full survey, when completed, will cover an area of more than 21,000 square degrees and include approximately 10 million Gaia sources, roughly equal to the number of stellar spectra obtained through the DESI Main Survey, while only utilizing &lt;9% of all DESI observing time.</description>

      <title>Confirmation and characterization of Galactic planetary nebulae: insights from a spectroscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic investigation of 25 objects previously reported as possible Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in recent catalogs to obtain their physical properties and to establish their true nature. We found 11 objects showing intense emission lines, 11 where it was not possible to measure $\mathrm{H{\beta}}$, and three where no lines are present. We have used diagnostic diagrams to confirm the true PN nature for eight objects. We obtained elemental abundances for three objects whose values are in agreement with the PNe mean values for our Galaxy. Four objects show [N II] $\lambda$6583 more intense than $\mathrm{H{\alpha}}$, and for two of them, this can be explained by the presence of shocks in the gas. Finally, we report angular sizes based on $\mathrm{H{\alpha}}$ and [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission.</description>

      <title>How Reconnection-Unfavored Magnetic Flux Emergence Suppresses Solar Filament Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux emergence is traditionally considered a key trigger of solar filament eruptions; however, its role in suppressing filament eruptions remains less understood. Using multi-wavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, this study investigates a unique case of flux emergence below a quiescent filament from January 3 to 5, 2016, where the newly emerging magnetic flux suppressed rather than promoted the eruption of the filament. It is found that the emerging magnetic bipole within the filament channel directly interacted and reconnected with the overlying filament magnetic field and produced a series of two-sided coronal jets along the filament axis. Instead of eruption, the filament kept stable but broke into two segments at the reconnection site. Further magnetic cancellation or recession of the emerged bipole allowed the filament to recover its original structure. Our analysis results revealed that the flux emergence suppressed the filament eruption by reducing the upward net force. The formation and evolution of filament fine structures, such as filament threads, are closely linked to the reconnection processes between the emerging bipole and the horizontal magnetic field of the filament. This study provides direct observational evidence for the stabilization of solar filaments driven by flux emergence, offering new insights into the dual role of magnetic emergence in triggering and suppressing solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>Explosion sites of SN 1994W-like transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sample of narrow-line transients that share characteristics with the Type IIn classified supernova (SN) 1994W, a prototypical member of this class of events, via investigation of their explosion sites and spectrophotometric data. The normalised cumulative rank (NCR) method was used to compare the explosion sites of 10 events to the star-formation distributions of their host galaxies, and to the sites of different evolved massive stars. The resulting sample mean value of NCR$_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} = 0.170 \pm 0.076$ is low, while the NCR$_{\mathrm{NUV}}$ distribution is flat with a mean value of $0.488 \pm 0.084$. The NCR distribution of SN 1994W-like events is consistent with relatively low-mass red supergiants (RSGs) and, despite the small sample size, inconsistent with high-mass stars such as luminous blue variables. To explain the nature of SN 1994W-like transients, interaction between an expanding ejecta and a relatively massive circumstellar medium is likely required, with the latter possibly having been produced by a H envelope ejection via a nuclear flash event, or a luminous red nova (LRN) from a stellar merger; both channels are consistent with low-mass RSGs suggested by the NCR results. In this context, we find the early $-26$ d spectrum from light curve maximum of SN 2003G to share similarities to those of F8-type supergiant stars and LRNe. Finally, based on late-time HST imaging, we set the deepest limits for the surviving precursor of SN 2011ht to $M_{\mathrm{F438W}} &gt; -3.8$ and $M_{\mathrm{F555W}} &gt; -4.0$ mag. This would exclude most supergiants as a non-terminal progenitor, assuming that such a star is not completely obscured by newly formed dust.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dark Matter on the Formation of Biogenic Elements in Early Universe Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos, offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Far-ultraviolet flares and variability of the young M dwarf AU Mic: a non-detection of planet c in transit at Lyman-alpha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape's potential to shape the exoplanet population motivates detailed observations of systems actively undergoing escape. AU Mic is a young and active M dwarf hosting two close-in transiting sub- to Neptune-sized planets. Atmospheric escape was previously detected on the inner planet b, with radially-blown neutral hydrogen producing ~30% blue-shifted absorption in Lyman-alpha. We obtained one HST/STIS transit of the outer planet c, to search for the planet's escaping atmosphere in transmission at Lyman-alpha and compare with AU Mic b. We detected 6 short-duration flares in Si IV and C IV, of which only one corresponded to a Lyman-alpha flare. We identified longer-duration stellar variability at the tens of percent level for lines less sensitive to stellar activity, including O I, C II and Lyman-alpha, which inhibits detection of an exosphere. We do not report absorption associated with an exosphere containing neutral hydrogen or any metals detectable in the far-ultraviolet, and discuss the implications of the non-detection. This work highlights the importance of 1) careful consideration of stellar variability in atmospheric escape observations, and 2) the dual-influence of photoionization and stellar wind when interpreting and modeling atmospheric escape.</description>

      <title>Oort Cloud Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's birth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution process is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations from passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \rm esc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \rm max}$) affect the Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14 M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\odot$ with a range of t$_{ \rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \rm max}$. For each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250 Myr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in the cluster from t$_{ \rm max}$ to t$_{ \rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets tend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \rm max}$ and t$_{ \rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \rm max}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain &gt;50% of their comets at t$_{ \rm esc}$, respectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the relationship, $\rm f=m\log_{10}(\frac{t_{ \rm esc}-t_{ \rm max}}{Myr})$ where m = 0.32$\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the cluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing logarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \rm max}$.</description>

      <title>Changing methodologies in solar physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study attempts to establish a basis for understanding how methods used in research in solar physics have evolved since World War II (WWII). The goal is to begin to explore if and how the changing research environment affects the training of young scientists, and the future of solar physics research at our institutions. A strategy based upon a sample of 650 PhD theses is used to seek possible trends over 8 decades, with the aim of uncovering any correlations between methods used and measures of success. Necessarily subjective, results depend on how methods are defined, and how success is measured. Although a brief justification of the choices made is attempted, trying mainly to avoid pitfalls such as counting citations, it is clear that further assessment is required. The statistical analysis is based upon necessarily subjective categorization and the inference of likelihoods of two different distributions being drawn from the same underlying distribution. The statistics seem to reflect historical events, such as the Kennedy Moonshot program and the associated SKYLAB mission, with changes delayed by a few years. The data suggest that impactful advances are becoming more rare. Yet the methods used have changed little barring those related to obvious technological advances (e.g. the advent of spacecraft, adaptive optics). A follow-up study to explore the 100,000+ publications in solar physics through machine learning seems warranted.</description>

      <title>SN 2023gpw: exploring the diversity and power sources of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our observations and analysis of SN~2023gpw, a hydrogen-rich superluminous supernova (SLSN~II) with broad emission lines in its post-peak spectra. Unlike previously observed SLSNe~II, its light curve suggests an abrupt drop during a solar conjunction between $\sim$80 and $\sim$180~d after the light-curve peak, possibly analogous to a normal hydrogen-rich supernova (SN). Spectra taken at and before the peak show hydrogen and helium `flash' emission lines attributed to early interaction with a dense confined circumstellar medium (CSM). A well-observed ultraviolet excess appears as these lines disappear, also as a result of CSM interaction. The blackbody photosphere expands roughly at the same velocity throughout the observations, indicating little or no bulk deceleration. This velocity is much higher than what is seen in spectral lines, suggesting asymmetry in the ejecta. The high total radiated energy ($\gtrsim9\times10^{50}$~erg) and aforementioned lack of bulk deceleration in SN~2023gpw are difficult to reconcile with a neutrino-driven SN simply combined with efficient conversion from kinetic energy to emission through interaction. This suggests an additional energy source such as a central engine. While magnetar-powered models qualitatively similar to SN~2023gpw exist, more modeling work is required to determine if they can reproduce the observed properties in combination with early interaction. The required energy might alternatively be provided by accretion onto a black hole created in the collapse of a massive progenitor star.</description>

Abstract: This paper is based on a dataset of many strongly polarized solar lines belonging to the ''second solar spectrum'', i.e. the spectrum near the limb in linear scattering polarization. The observations were done at the Pic du Midi Turret Dome in 2006. The solar spectra were recorded at high spectral resolution (R = 400000) with the spectrograph slit orthogonal to the solar limb, so that $\mu$ = cos$\theta$ continuously varied from 0 .0 to 0.45. The crystal liquid polarimeter delivered the linear polarization rate (Q/I). Strong lines such as CaII 3934 {\AA}, CaI 4227 {\AA}, SrI 4607 {\AA}, SrII 4078 {\AA}, BaII 4554 {\AA} were studied. We measured the Hanle depolarization with the help of models predicting the polarization envelope with no magnetic field and we got values in the range 13-25 Gauss for the unresolved turbulent magnetic field, and we found that it often decreases towards the limb, revealing an altitude gradient. This present analysis was not yet published and spectra shown here become freely available to the research community.</description>

Abstract: The best way to check the validity of our theories (models) is by direct comparison with the experiment (observations). In this study, we address the numerical inaccuracies intrinsic to the process of comparing theory and observations. To achieve this goal, we built 4D spectra grids for Wolf-Rayet stars (WC and WN spectral classes) and Blue Supergiants (BSGs) characterized by low metallicity similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Through rigorous testing on designated `test' models, we demonstrated that the numerical precision of derived stellar parameters (effective temperature, mass-loss rate, luminosity, and wind velocity) is not exceeding 0.05 dex. Moreover, the mean absolute deviation of the numerically derived stellar parameters is consistently below this threshold for objects with both weak (SMC grid) and strong winds (WC and WN grids), even in the presence of Gaussian noise. Furthermore, we explored the influence of unaccounted factors, including variations in the metal abundances, wind acceleration laws, and clumping, on the precision of the derived parameters. We found that the first two factors have the strongest influence on the numerical accuracy of the derived stellar parameters. Variations in abundances predominantly influenced the mass-loss rate for weak-wind scenarios, while effective temperature and luminosity remained robust. We found that the wind acceleration law influence the numerical uncertainty of the derived wind parameters mostly for models with weak winds. Interestingly, different degrees of clumping demonstrated good precision for spectra with strong winds, contrasting with a decrease in the precision for weak-wind cases. We found also that the accuracy of our approach depends on spectral range and the inclusion of ultraviolet spectral range improves the precision of derived parameters, especially for object with weak winds.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of stars stripped in binaries: The effect of metallicity</title>

Abstract: Stars stripped of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through binary interaction are thought to be responsible for both hydrogen-poor supernovae and the hard ionizing radiation observed in low-$Z$ galaxies. A population of these stars was recently observed for the first time, but their prevalence remains unknown. In preparation for such measurements, we estimate the mass distribution of hot, stripped stars using a population synthesis code that interpolates over detailed single and binary stellar evolution tracks. We predict that for a constant star formation rate of $1 \,M_\odot$/yr and regardless of metallicity, a scalable model population contains ~30,000 stripped stars with mass $M_{\rm strip}&gt;1M_\odot$ and ~4,000 stripped stars that are sufficiently massive to explode ($M_{\rm strip}&gt;2.6M_\odot$). Below $M_{\rm strip}=5M_\odot$, the distribution is metallicity-independent and can be described by a power law with the exponent $\alpha \sim -2$. At higher masses and lower metallicity ($Z \lesssim 0.002$), the mass distribution exhibits a drop. This originates from the prediction, frequently seen in evolutionary models, that massive low-metallicity stars do not expand substantially until central helium burning or later and therefore cannot form long-lived stripped stars. With weaker line-driven winds at low metallicity, this suggests that neither binary interaction nor wind mass loss can efficiently strip massive stars at low metallicity. As a result, a "helium-star desert" emerges around $M_{\rm strip} =15\, M_\odot$ at $Z=0.002$, covering an increasingly large mass range with decreasing metallicity. We note that these high-mass stars are those that potentially boost a galaxy's He$^+$-ionizing radiation and that participate in the formation of merging black holes. This "helium-star desert" therefore merits further study.</description>

      <title>ChronoFlow: A Data-Driven Model for Gyrochronology</title>

Abstract: Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, the observed dispersion in rotation rates for similar coeval stars has historically been difficult to characterize. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of $\approx$8,000 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages. These contribute an additional 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We apply ChronoFlow to estimate ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 6709, and the Theia 456 stellar stream. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow is publicly available at https://github.com/philvanlane/chronoflow.</description>

      <title>Modeling Asteroseismic Yields for the Roman Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.</description>

      <title>Five New Sirius-Like White Dwarf + Main Sequence Star Systems with MagAO-X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most known white dwarfs in multiple systems with main sequence stars have been discovered with M-type companions, because the white dwarf causes detectable UV excess and bluer colors than expected from a single M star. Surveys have shown that the number of white dwarfs in Sirius-like systems within 100 pc of the Sun is lower than expected, suggesting that white dwarfs are being missed in the glare of their main sequence companions. In this work we have leveraged the angular resolution and high-contrast capabilities, as well as optimization for visible wavelengths, of the extreme adaptive optics instrument MagAO-X to detect new white dwarf companions to AFGK stars. We present the first results of our survey with the extreme AO instrument MagAO-X, called the Pup Search, of 18 targets with seven new candidate companions, five of which are confirmed to be white dwarfs. We discuss the new detections in the context of previous surveys and other detection metric sensitivities and show that we are sensitive to a region not probed by other surveys. Finally we discuss the future of the Pup Search in light of developing technologies.</description>

      <title>Study on physical properties and characteristics of an anisotropic compact star model using Karmarkar Condition in F(Q) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this study is to examine the behaviour of physical parameters of an anisotropic compact star model demonstrating spherical symmetry in F(Q) modified gravity. To evaluate the behaviour and the stability of an anisotropic compact star model, we utilise the measured mass and radius of an anisotropic compact star model. This study obtained an anisotropic compact star model by solving Einstein field equations. The field equations have been simplified by an appropriate selection of the metric elements and the Karmarkar condition. By solving the field equation to develop a differential equation that establishes a relationship between two essential components of spacetime. A physical analysis of this model reveals that the resulting stellar structure for anisotropic matter distribution is a physically plausible representation of a compact star with an energy density of order $10^14 g/cm^3$. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, causality condition and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov Condition, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and stability of the compact star Cen X-3. We further determined the mass-radius relation of this compact star for different values of delta}1.</description>
