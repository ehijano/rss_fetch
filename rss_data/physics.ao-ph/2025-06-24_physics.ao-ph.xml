      <title>A deep-learning model for predicting daily PM2.5 concentration in response to emission reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health threat, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) contributing to millions of premature deaths annually. Chemical transport models (CTMs) are essential tools for evaluating how emission controls improve air quality and save lives, but they are computationally intensive. Reduced form models accelerate simulations but sacrifice spatial-temporal granularity, accuracy, and flexibility. Here we present CleanAir, a deep-learning-based model developed as an efficient alternative to CTMs in simulating daily PM2.5 and its chemical compositions in response to precursor emission reductions at 36 km resolution, which could predict PM2.5 concentration for a full year within 10 seconds on a single GPU, a speed five orders of magnitude faster. Built on a Residual Symmetric 3D U-Net architecture and trained on more than 2,400 emission reduction scenarios generated by a well-validated Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, CleanAir generalizes well across unseen meteorological years and emission patterns. It produces results comparable to CMAQ in both absolute concentrations and emission-induced changes, enabling efficient, full-coverage simulations across short-term interventions and long-term planning horizons. This advance empowers researchers and policymakers to rapidly evaluate a wide range of air quality strategies and assess the associated health impacts, thereby supporting more responsive and informed environmental decision-making.</description>

      <title>Efficient and High-Accuracy Ray Tracing in Discretized Ionospheric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex ionospheric medium poses a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in high-frequency (HF) ray tracing. This paper introduces a high-fidelity ray tracing model (RTM) employing a C1-continuous Galerkin-Difference (GD) interpolation strategy for three-dimensional electron density reconstruction. RTM-GD ensures analytically smooth gradients, significantly enhancing gradient continuity, numerical stability, and computational efficiency in Hamiltonian-based ray tracing. We design a four-stage validation framework. First, we assess the numerical robustness of RTM-GD across spatial resolutions. Second, elevation-angle scans from 3 to 65 degrees with 1-degree steps show that RTM-GD improves path accuracy by over an order of magnitude compared to Catmull-Rom interpolation, while achieving a 14.6x speedup over Richardson extrapolation. Third, in steep-gradient F2-layer scenarios, RTM-GD further reduces trajectory errors, confirming its enhanced stability. Finally, comparisons with measured HF propagation data demonstrate its ability to reproduce typical F2 dual-mode behavior. Overall, RTM-GD provides a scalable and robust solution for precision-critical ionospheric ray tracing, enhancing HF propagation modeling capabilities.</description>

      <title>Growth rate and energy dissipation in wind-forced breaking waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy growth and dissipation of wind-forced breaking waves using direct numerical simulations of the coupled air-water Navier-Stokes equations. We vary the wind friction velocity over the wave speed $u_\ast/c$ up to 1. A turbulent wind boundary layer drives the growth of a pre-existing narrowband wave field until it breaks and transfers energy into the water column. Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field then resumes growth. We separately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking-induced dissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and turbulent dissipation during breaking. The wave growth rate scales with $(u_\ast/c)^2$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering. The energy dissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking, confirming the universality of the process. Following breaking, near-surface vertical turbulence dissipation profiles scale as $z^{-1}$, with its magnitude controlled by the breaking-induced dissipation.</description>

      <title>The dominant role of jetting in micron- and sub-micron sea spray produced by bubble bursting: a revised model and comparison with measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary physical mechanism governing the production of sub-micron sea spray aerosols (SSA) -- specifically the competition between film and jet droplets from bubble bursting -- has remained a subject of intense debate. This work presents a revised, first-principles model that establishes the overwhelming dominance of jetting for producing micron and sub-micron aerosols. Our approach first rules out the film droplet mechanism as a primary contributor for this size range by demonstrating through physical scaling and numerical simulations that the final average ejected volume of sub-micron droplets is much smaller than that from jetting. A comprehensive global probability distribution function (PDF) for SSA is constructed by rigorously modeling its fundamental components in sequence: (i) refining the sub-surface bubble size distribution with a simpler and better experimentally supported exponential law, and (ii) deriving consistent number and size distribution models of droplets per bursting event from an ample set of high-resolution numerical simulations. The droplet size PDF from a single bubble follows a highly-skewed distribution -- optimally modeled by a Generalized Inverse Gaussian distribution -- revealing the production of nanometric droplets previously unaccounted for by simpler models. When integrated, these components yield a final predictive model for the global SSA size distribution, with parameters derived directly from physical principles and simulations rather than empirical fitting. The model demonstrates extraordinary predictive accuracy, aligning almost perfectly with experimental data from both laboratory and oceanic measurements, in particular across the critical 25 nm to 2.5 $\mu$m range. This research significantly enhances the fundamental understanding of marine aerosol generation and provides a more accurate foundation for climate and atmospheric chemistry models.</description>

      <title>The largest Forbush decrease in 20 years: Preliminary analysis of SEVAN network observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary analysis of the largest Forbush Decrease (FD) observed in solar cycle 25 using SEVAN network data. Triggered by consecutive Earth-directed CMEs on May 30 and 31, 2025, this event produced two distinct FD minima and a prolonged recovery, with significant anisotropies in cosmic ray response across the network. The timing of interplanetary shock arrivals was confirmed by SSC signatures at 05:22 UTC on June 1 and 10:19 UTC on June 2, marking the onset of each FD phase. The depth and temporal structure of the FD varied across SEVAN detectors, providing insights into the complex heliospheric and magnetospheric dynamics during this multi-CME event.</description>

      <title>The mechanism of tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new theory on tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes based on Kelvin-Helmholtz Theorems. When the pressure difference between the lowest pressure line from the wall cloud down to the ground and its surroundings is large enough, the increase of vorticity inside the squeezed vortex tube can reach the tornado level, and thus a tornado is born. When the pressure difference increases, the tornado strength increases. When the pressure difference decreases, the tornado strength decreases. The decay of tornadoes is caused by the decreasing pressure difference. This is our theory of the entire tornado lifespan.</description>

      <title>Runaway processes in the upper and lower atmosphere: a change of paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanches (RREA) are central to understanding a spectrum of high-energy atmospheric phenomena, including Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs), and gamma-ray glows. Despite their common physical origin, these events are often treated separately due to differences in detection methods, duration, and altitude. In this work, we present a unified conceptual and observational framework that reinterprets these radiation bursts as manifestations of the same runaway processes occurring in distinct atmospheric depths. Integrating recent results from satellite (ASIM), aircraft (ALOFT), balloon (HELEN), and ground-based (SEVAN) experiments, we demonstrate consistent spectral and temporal behavior across scales. We propose a rational revision of current terminology and challenge longstanding models that attribute TGFs to lightning leader dynamics. This study resolves key contradictions in the field, establishes new classification criteria based on physics rather than detector location, and reshapes our understanding of particle acceleration in thunderstorms.</description>

      <title>Fusion of multi-source precipitation records via coordinate-based generative model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precipitation remains one of the most challenging climate variables to observe and predict accurately. Existing datasets face intricate trade-offs: gauge observations are relatively trustworthy but sparse, satellites provide global coverage with retrieval uncertainties, and numerical models offer physical consistency but are biased and computationally intensive. Here we introduce PRIMER (Precipitation Record Infinite MERging), a deep generative framework that fuses these complementary sources to produce accurate, high-resolution, full-coverage precipitation estimates. PRIMER employs a coordinate-based diffusion model that learns from arbitrary spatial locations and associated precipitation values, enabling seamless integration of gridded data and irregular gauge observations. Through two-stage training--first learning large-scale patterns, then refining with accurate gauge measurements--PRIMER captures both large-scale climatology and local precision. Once trained, it can downscale forecasts, interpolate sparse observations, and correct systematic biases within a principled Bayesian framework. Using gauge observations as ground truth, PRIMER effectively corrects biases in existing datasets, yielding statistically significant error reductions at most stations and furthermore enhancing the spatial coherence of precipitation fields. Crucially, it generalizes without retraining, correcting biases in operational forecasts it has never seen. This demonstrates how generative AI can transform Earth system science by combining imperfect data, providing a scalable solution for global precipitation monitoring and prediction.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Equations for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{Rescaled Rapidly Rotating incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations} (RRRiNSE). We solve the RRRiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$ and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RRRiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RRRiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory is presented for linear, local, short-wavelength instabilities in swirling flows, in which axial shear, differential rotation, radial thermal stratification, viscosity, and thermal diffusivity are all taken into account. A geometrical optics approach is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation, leading to a set of amplitude transport equations. From these, a dispersion relation is derived, capturing two distinct types of instability: a stationary centrifugal instability and an oscillatory, visco-diffusive McIntyre instability. Instability regions corresponding to different axial or azimuthal wavenumbers are found to possess envelopes in the plane of physical parameters, which are explicitly determined using the discriminants of polynomials. As these envelopes are shown to bound the union of instability regions associated with particular wavenumbers, it is concluded that the envelopes correspond to curves of critical values of physical parameters, thereby providing compact, closed-form criteria for the onset of instability. The derived analytical criteria are validated for swirling flows modelled by a cylindrical, differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria unify and extend, to viscous and thermodiffusive differentially heated swirling flows, the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling, differentially heated, visco-diffusive flows, thereby generalising the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Democracy of AI Numerical Weather Models: An Example of Global Forecasting with FourCastNetv2 Made by a University Research Lab Using GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.</description>
