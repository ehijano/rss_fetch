      <title>A Be star-black hole binary with a wide orbit from LAMOST time-domain survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems consisting of an early type star and a black hole (BH) are crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, particularly the origins of detected gravitational wave sources. Be binary systems are expected to represent a key evolutionary stage in hosting BHs. However, while hundreds of Be X-ray binaries are known, the only confirmed BH candidate in a Be binary remains highly controversial. We report the discovery of ALS 8814, a Be star-BH binary with a moderately eccentric ($e = 0.23$) and wide orbit ($P = 176.6$ days), revealed by the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the visible Be star. Our analysis, combining flux-calibrated spectra in the Balmer discontinuity region and spectral template matching, yields a mass of $11.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$ $M_\odot$ for the Be star. The minimum mass of the unseen companion, assuming an edge-on inclination ($i = 90^{\circ}$), is $9.8\pm 0.7\,M_\odot$. We rule out the presence of non-degenerate companions in ALS 8814, indicating that it can only be a BH. This discovery represents a robust case of a Be-BH binary, identified purely through precise RV measurements from a single set of lines. The extremely low peculiar velocity of ALS 8814 suggests that the BH is formed via a direct core-collapse with a negligible natal kick, implying an almost perfect alignment between the Be star's spin and the orbital plane. In this context, the binary's inclination angle is estimated to be 22$^{\circ}$-49$^{\circ}$ by analyzing the shallow double-peaked profile of the H$\alpha$ emission line. This inclination range corresponds to a BH mass estimate between $15\,M_\odot$ and $58\,M_\odot$. As the only unambiguous Be-BH binary system known to date, ALS 8814 provides valuable constraints on the BH formation in a binary system with a high-mass companion.</description>

      <title>Thirty-Three New Stellar Angular Diameters from the NPOI, and Nearly 180 NPOI Diameters as an Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new angular diameter measurements for 33 stars from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, reaching uncertainties on the limb-darkened diameter of 2% or less for 21 targets. We also determined the physical radius, bolometric flux, luminosity, and effective temperature for each star. Our sample is a mix of giant, subgiant, and dwarf stars, and span spectral classes from mid-A to to mid-K. We combined these 33 stars with samples from previous publications to analyze how the NPOI diameters compare to those obtained using other means, namely (V-K) color, the JMMC Stellar Diameters Catalog, and Gaia predictions.</description>

      <title>The fraction of polar aligned circumbinary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary gas disks that are misaligned to the binary orbital plane evolve toward either a coplanar or a polar-aligned configuration with respect to the binary host. The preferred alignment depends on the dynamics of the disk: whether it undergoes librating or circulating nodal precession, with librating disks evolving to polar inclinations and circulating disks evolving to coplanar. We quantify the fraction of binary star systems whose disks are expected to have polar orbits $f_\text{polar}$, extending previous work to include disks with non-zero mass. Our results suggest that, for low mass disks, the polar fraction is highly sensitive to the distribution of binary eccentricity with a higher fraction expected for higher binary eccentricities, $f_{\rm polar}\sim e_{\rm b}$. However, for massive discs, the fraction is independent of the binary eccentricity and $f_{\rm polar}\approx 0.37$. The value of $f_\text{polar}$ is always reduced in a population with a greater preference for low initial mutual inclination. We also explore the consequences of the finite lifetime and non-zero radial extent of a real disk, both of which affect a disk's ability to complete its evolution to a stationary configuration. Our findings can be used to make predictions given populations with well-understood distributions of binary eccentricity, initial mutual inclination, and disk angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Measuring pulsar profile variations with 2-D Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-correlated variations in the pulse profiles of radio pulsars provide insights into changes in their magnetospheres. For a small number of pulsars (~20), these variations have been shown to correlate with spin-down rate. Many of these profile changes involve small (few percent) variations in the relative intensity of different profile components, and hence tools such as Gaussian process regression have been employed to separate the time-correlated profile variation from intrinsic noise. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approximation of a 2-D Gaussian process model that enhances sensitivity by simultaneously tracking time- and phase-correlated signals. Applying this model to 26 pulsars observed at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we detect significant profile shape variations in 21 pulsars. Using principal component analysis, we confirm spin-down correlated shape variations in 11 pulsars where this had been previously observed. Additionally, we find evidence of spin-down correlated shape changes in 7 pulsars for the first time (PSRs B0105+65, B0611+22, B0626+24, B1740-03, B1826-17, B1917+00, and B2148+63). We look in greater detail at PSR B0740-28, where the correlation between profile shape and spin-down itself seems to switch between quasi-stable states. Notably the profile shape associated with greater spin-down seems to invert at times, presenting a challenge to our understanding of the physical processes at work.</description>

      <title>Can slow pulsars in Milky Way globular clusters form via partial recycling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alongside the population of several hundred radio millisecond pulsars currently known in Milky Way globular clusters, a subset of six slowly spinning pulsars (spin periods $0.3-4\,$s) are also observed. With inferred magnetic fields $\gtrsim 10^{11}\,$G and characteristic ages $\lesssim10^8\,$yr, explaining the formation of these apparently young pulsars in old stellar populations poses a major challenge. One popular explanation is that these objects are not actually young but instead have been partially spun up via accretion from a binary companion. In this scenario, accretion in a typical low-mass X-ray binary is interrupted by a dynamical encounter with a neighboring object in the cluster. Instead of complete spin up to millisecond spin periods, the accretion is halted prematurely, leaving behind a ''partially recycled'' neutron star. In this Letter, we use a combination of analytic arguments motivated by low-mass X-ray binary evolution and $N$-body simulations to show that this partial-recycling mechanism is not viable. Realistic globular clusters are not sufficiently dense to interrupt mass transfer on the short timescales required to achieve such slow spin periods. We argue that collapse of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron star collisions are more promising ways to form slow pulsars in old globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Carbon-rich dust injected into the interstellar medium by Galactic WC binaries survives for hundreds of years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, detected with an age of at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted for in galactic dust budgets.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit light curves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameter spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multiplanet transit light curves that display transit timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub. We demonstrate with a simulated data set that Bayesian inference with the NUTS HMC algorithm, which uses the model gradient, can outperform the affine invariant (e.g. emcee) MCMC algorithm in CPU time per effective sample, and we find that the relative sampling efficiency improves with the number of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Global properties, fractality, and mass segregation in single, paired, and grouped open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and dynamical properties of Open Clusters (OCs) classified as single, in pairs, or in groups. By analysing their mass, size, age, fractality, and mass segregation, we aim to identify systematic differences among these categories and evaluate the role of the Galactic environment in their evolution. Our sample comprises 420 single OCs, 415 in pairs, and 317 in groups. To characterise their structure, we apply the Q-parameter, which distinguishes fractal from radial distributions. We also compute the local density ratio to quantify mass segregation and explore its dependence on environment. Grouped OCs tend to be the youngest, followed by those in pairs, while single OCs generally exhibit older ages. Although sizes are comparable, OCs in pairs and groups tend to be less concentrated. Structurally, grouped OCs show the highest fractality, which decreases with age as clusters evolve towards more radial configurations. Mass segregation is detected in ~80% of OCs, with a slightly higher incidence in single clusters. Some older single OCs show inverse segregation, with massive stars at larger radii. Spatially, single OCs are more dispersed, whereas paired and grouped ones are concentrated in spiral arms and star-forming regions. OC evolution appears to be shaped by both internal dynamics and environmental influences. Single OCs tend to exhibit signs of more advanced dynamical evolution, whereas those in pairs and groups may retain features reflecting their formation environment. Substructures and high fractality in younger clusters suggest that early interactions play a key role in their long-term development. More massive OCs evolve towards radial configurations, while less massive ones may retain fractal properties for longer. These findings highlight the interplay between intrinsic properties and external conditions in shaping OC evolution.</description>
