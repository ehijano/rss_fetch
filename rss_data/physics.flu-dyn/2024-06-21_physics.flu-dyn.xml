      <title>Linear stability of turbulent channel flow with one-point closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For low enough flow rates, turbulent channel flow displays spatial modulations of large wavelengths. This phenomenon has recently been interpreted as a linear instability of the turbulent flow. We question here the ability of linear stability analysis around the turbulent mean flow to predict the onset and wavelengths of such modulations. Both the mean flow and the Reynolds stresses are extracted from direct numerical simulation (DNS) in periodic computational domains of different size. The Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire formalism is used here, with the turbulent viscosity either ignored, evaluated from DNS, or modeled using a simple one-point closure model. Independently of the closure model and the domain size, the mean turbulent flow is found to be linearly stable, in marked contrast with the observed behavior. This suggests that the one-point approach is not sufficient to predict instability, at odds with other turbulent flow cases. For generic wall-bounded shear flows we discuss how the correct models for predicting instability could include fluctuations in a more explicit way.</description>

      <title>Effects of settling on inertial particle slip velocity statistics in wall bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing reduced order models for the transport of solid particles in turbulence typically requires a statistical description of the particle-turbulence interactions. In this work, we utilize a statistical framework to derive continuum equations for the moments of the slip velocity of inertial settling Lagrangian particles in a turbulent boundary layer. Using coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian direct numerical simulations, we then identify the dominant mechanisms controlling the slip velocity variance, and find that for a range of St+, Sv+, and Re, the slip variance is primarily controlled by local differences between the "seen" variance and the particle velocity variance, while terms appearing due to the inhomogeneity of the turbulence are sub-leading until Sv+ becomes large. We also consider several comparative metrics to assess the relative magnitudes of the fluctuating slip velocity and the mean slip velocity, and we find that the vertical mean slip increases rapidly with Sv+, rendering the variance relatively small -- an effect found to be most substantial for Sv+&gt;1. Finally, we compare the results to a model of the acceleration variance Berk and Coletti (2021) based the concept of a response function described in Csanady (1963), highlighting the role of the crossing trajectories mechanism. We find that while there is good agreement for low Sv+, systematic errors remain, possibly due to implicit non-local effects arising from rapid particle settling and inhomogeneous turbulence. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for modeling the transport of coarse dust grains in the atmospheric surface layer.</description>

      <title>A fully observer-covariant formulation of the fluid dynamics of simple fluids: derivation, simple examples and a generalized Orr-Sommerfeld equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism to describe the motion of a fluid fully which is fully covariant with respect to arbitrary observers. To achieve fully covariance, we write prognostic equations for quantities that belong to the graded exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle of the manifold occupied by the fluid. With the new formalism, we consider problems of stability, and we derive a generalization of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation that describes the evolution of perturbations relative to an arbitrary observer. The latter is applied to cases where the observer is the Lagrangian observer comoving with the background flow.</description>

      <title>Poiseuille flow for a simplified pseduoplastic rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poiseuille flow in cylindrical and planar geometries with a simplified, pseudoplastic (shear thinning) rheology characterized by constant viscosity plateaus above and below a transition strain rate is considered. Analytical, steady state solutions for velocity profile and volume flux are formulated. Transient flow development is addressed numerically and compared to the theory in the steady state limit. Stationary flow is approached after the momentum diffusion timescale based on the spatially dominant kinematic viscosity. For large viscosity ratio and shear thinning region confined near the domain boundary, velocity distributions are quasi-plug like with large boundary to interior strain rate ratio.</description>

      <title>U-shaped disks in Stokes flow: Chiral sedimentation of a non-chiral particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sedimentation of U-shaped circular disks in the Stokes limit of vanishing inertia. We simulate the flow past such disks using a finite-element-based solution of the 3D Stokes equations, accounting for the integrable singularities that develop along their edges. We show that the purely vertical sedimentation of such disks in their upright- [upside-down-] U orientation is unstable to perturbations about their pitching [rolling] axes. The instability is found to depend only weakly on the size of the container in which the disks sediment, allowing us to analyse their behaviour based on the resistance matrix which governs the evolution of the disk's six rigid-body degrees of freedom in an unbounded fluid. We show that the governing equations can be reduced to two ODEs which describe the disk's inclination against the direction of gravity. A phase-plane analysis, results of which are in good agreement with experiments, reveals that the two instabilities generally cause the disk to sediment along complex spiral trajectories while it alternates between pitching- and rolling-dominated motions. The chirality of the trajectories is set by the initial conditions rather than the (non-chiral) shape of the disk. For certain initial orientations, the disk retains its inclination and sediments along a perfectly helical path. The observed behaviour is fundamentally different from that displayed by flat circular disks which sediment without any reorientation. We therefore study the effect of variations in the disk's curvature to show how in the limit of vanishing curvature the behaviour of a flat disk is recovered.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional, One-Phase and Two-Phase Eulerian Explicit Shock Tube Simulation Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a one-dimensional simulation code was developed for both single-phase and two-phase systems, focusing on time-dependent Euler equations for gas and particles. These equations, non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws, describe the dynamics of compressible materials, where body forces, viscous stresses, and heat flux are neglected. The Euler equations were discretized using the finite volume method, and the code was written in MATLAB. To test the accuracy of the computational fluid code, the Sod shock tube problem, a physical analogue of the Riemann problem, was employed. This problem models a pressure discontinuity where high and low-pressure regions are separated by a diaphragm, which breaks at t=0, creating a discontinuity in density as well. Exact solutions were used for code verification. A key focus was on modeling a curtain of particles impacted by a shock wave, relevant to multiphase heterogeneous cylindrical explosion studies by the PSAAP II project. This initiative, funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC), involves Sandia National Laboratories and the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence at the University of Florida. The propagation of uncertainties in the maximum density of the particle curtain was studied by varying initial curtain thickness and initial high density. Given the computational expense of multiple code evaluations for uncertainty propagation, a multi-fidelity surrogate model combining low and high-fidelity simulations was implemented. This model facilitated uncertainty propagation using DAKOTA, a flexible and extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective optimization of the magnetic wiping process in dip-coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wiping systems allow to pre-meter the coating thickness of the liquid metal on a moving substrate. These systems have the potential to provide a more uniform coating and significantly higher production rates compared to pneumatic wiping, but they require substantially larger amounts of energy. This work presents a multi-objective optimization accounting for (1) maximal wiping efficiency (2) maximal smoothness of the wiping meniscus, and (3) minimal Joule heating. We present the Pareto front, identifying the best wiping conditions given a set of weights for the three competing objectives. The optimization was based on a 1D steady-state integral model, whose prediction scales according to the Hartmann number (Ha). The optimization uses a multi-gradient approach, with gradients computed with a combination of finite differences and variational methods. The results show that the wiping efficiency depends solely on Ha and not the magnetic field distribution. Moreover, we show that the liquid thickness becomes insensitive to the intensity of the magnetic field above a certain threshold and that the current distribution (hence the Joule heating) is mildly affected by the magnetic field's intensity and shape.</description>

      <title>Approaches to conservative Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is typically used for barotropic fluids, where the pressure depends only on the local mass density. Here, we show how to incorporate the entropy into the SPH, so that the pressure can also depend on the temperature, while keeping the growth of the total entropy, conservation of the total energy, and symplecticity of the reversible part of the SPH equations. The SPH system of ordinary differential equations with entropy is derived by means of the Poisson reduction and the Lagrange-Euler transformation. We present several approaches towards SPH with entropy, which are then illustrated on systems with discontinuities, on adiabatic and nonadiabatic expansion, and on the Rayleigh-Beenard convection without the Boussinesq approximation. Finally, we show how to model hyperbolic heat conduction within the SPH, extending the SPH variables with not only entropy but also a heat-flux-related vector field.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is an energy estimate in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. With additional assumptions, it is uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <title>Flow and clogging of capillary droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capillary droplets form due to surface tension when two immiscible fluids are mixed. We describe the motion of gravity-driven capillary droplets flowing through narrow constrictions and obstacle arrays in both simulations and experiments. Our new capillary deformable particle model recapitulates the shape and velocity of single oil droplets in water as they pass through narrow constrictions in microfluidic chambers. Using this experimentally validated model, we simulate the flow and clogging of single capillary droplets in narrow channels and obstacle arrays and find several important results. First, the capillary droplet speed profile is nonmonotonic as the droplet exits the narrow orifice, and we can tune the droplet properties so that the speed overshoots the terminal speed far from the constriction. Second, in obstacle arrays, we find that extremely deformable droplets can wrap around obstacles, which leads to decreased average droplet speed in the continuous flow regime and increased probability for clogging in the regime where permanent clogs form. Third, the wrapping mechanism causes the clogging probability in obstacle arrays to become nonmonotonic with surface tension $\Gamma$. At large $\Gamma$, the droplets are nearly rigid and the clogging probability is large since the droplets can not squeeze through the gaps between obstacles. With decreasing $\Gamma$, the clogging probability decreases as the droplets become more deformable. However, in the small-$\Gamma$ limit the clogging probability increases, since the droplets are extremely deformable and cause clogs as they wrap around the obstacles. The results from these studies are important for developing a predictive understanding of capillary droplet flows through complex and confined geometries.</description>

      <title>The inviscid fixed point of the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scaling regime characterized by a $z=1$ dynamical critical exponent has been reported in several numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and noisy Burgers equations. This scaling was found to emerge in the tensionless limit for the interface and in the inviscid limit for the fluid. Based on functional renormalization group, the origin of this scaling has been elucidated. It was shown to be controlled by a yet unpredicted fixed point of the one-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation, termed inviscid Burgers fixed point. The associated universal properties, including the scaling function, were calculated. Here, we generalize this analysis to the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation. We show that the inviscid-Burgers fixed point exists in all dimensions $d$, and that it controls the large momentum behavior of the correlation functions in the inviscid limit. It turns out that it yields in all $d$ the same super-universal value $z=1$ for the dynamical exponent.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universal Drag Law in a Model of Superflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fundamentally different dissipation mechanisms, many laws and phenomena of classical turbulence equivalently manifest in quantum turbulence. The Reynolds law of dynamical similarity states that two objects of same geometry across different length scales are hydrodynamically equivalent under the same Reynolds number, leading to a universal drag coefficient law. In this work we confirm the existence of a universal drag law in a superfluid wake, facilitated by the nucleation of quantized vortices. We numerically study superfluid flow across a range of Reynolds numbers for the paradigmatic classical hard-wall and the Gaussian obstacle, popular in experimental quantum hydrodynamics. In addition, we provide a feasible method for measuring superfluid drag forces in an experimental environment using control volumes.</description>

      <title>An unusual bifurcation scenario in a stably stratified, valley-shaped enclosure heated from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We delineate the structure of steady laminar flows within a stably stratified, valley-shaped triangular cavity heated from below through linear stability analysis and Navier-Stokes simulations. We derive an exact solution to the quiescent conduction state, and characterize the flow via the stratification perturbation parameter, $\Pi_s$, which is a measure of the strength of the surface heat flux relative to the background stable stratification. Beyond a threshold value of $\Pi_s$, two unstable eigenmodes appear, one marked by a dominant central circulation, and the other one exhibiting dual circulations of equal strength. Through Navier-Stokes simulations, we confirm that the central-circulation eigenmode generates a pair of asymmetric steady states, whereas the dual-circulation eigenmode leads to distinct upslope and downslope symmetric steady states. Linear stability analysis and Navier-Stokes simulations jointly confirm the instability of the two symmetric steady states, both of which transition to the asymmetric steady state under a perturbation. Thus, for a given set of dimensionless parameters, the Navier-Stokes equations admit at least five possible steady-state solutions. Two of these solutions, namely the quiescent, pure conduction state and the counter-intuitive symmetric downslope state, have previously been overlooked in heated, stably stratified, valley-shaped enclosures. These five flow solutions reveal an intriguing bifurcation structure, including both a perfect pitchfork bifurcation and a nested bifurcation that gives rise to two distinct states. The inner bifurcation, while resembling a pitchfork in some respects, does not break any symmetry of the valley due to the lack of any possible horizontal axis of symmetry. The categorization of this inner bifurcation remains an unresolved matter, as it does not conform to any established descriptions of canonical bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Urban Boundary-Layer Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling is a viable solution for applications involving repetitive evaluations of expensive computational fluid dynamics models, such as uncertainty quantification and inverse problems. This study proposes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based machine-learning surrogate for canopy flow statistics accommodating any approaching mean-wind angle. The training and testing of the surrogate model is based on results from large-eddy simulations of open-channel flow over and within surface-mounted cubes under neutral ambient stratification. The training dataset comprises flow statistics from various approaching mean-wind angles, and the surrogate is asked to "connect between the dots," i.e., to predict flow statistics for unseen values of the approaching mean-wind angle. The MLP performance is compared against a more traditional spline-based interpolation approach for a range of training data. In terms of relative mean absolute errors on individual flow statistics, the proposed MLP surrogate consistently outperforms the spline interpolation, especially when the number of training samples is reduced. The MLP model accurately captures mean profiles and three-dimensional flow variability, offering robust predictions, even when trained with as few as four approaching wind angles. The model is $10^4 \times$ faster than large-eddy simulations, thus proving effective for multi-query tasks in the context of urban canopy flow modeling.</description>

      <title>Poles, Shocks and Tygers: The Time-reversible Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a formally time-reversible, one-dimensional forced Burgers equation by imposing a global constraint of energy conservation, wherein the constant viscosity is modified to a fluctuating state-dependent dissipation coefficient. The system exhibits dynamical properties which bear strong similarities with those observed for the Burgers equation and can be understood using the dynamics of the poles, shocks, and truncation effects, such as tygers. A complex interplay of these give rise to interesting statistical regimes ranging from hydrodynamic behavior to a completely thermalized warm phase. The end of the hydrodynamic regime is associated with the appearance of a shock in the solution and a continuous transition leading to a truncation-dependent state. Beyond this, the truncation effects such as tygers and the appearance of secondary discontinuity at the resonance point in the solution strongly influence the statistical properties. These disappear at the second transition, at which the global quantities exhibit a jump and attain values that are consistent with the establishment of a quasiequilibrium state characterized by energy equipartition among the Fourier modes. Our comparative analysis shows that the macroscopic statistical properties of the formally time-reversible system and the Burgers equation are equivalent in all the regimes, irrespective of the truncation effects, and this equivalence is not just limited to the hydrodynamic regime, thereby further strengthening the Gallavotti's equivalence conjecture. The properties of the system are further examined by inspecting the complex space singularities in the velocity field of the Burgers equation. Furthermore, an effective theory is proposed to describe the discontinuous transition.</description>

      <title>Triglobal resolvent-analysis-based control of separated flows around low-aspect-ratio wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of actively controlled laminar separated wakes around low-aspect-ratio wings with two primary goals: (i) reducing the size of the separation bubble and (ii) attenuating the wing tip vortex. Instead of preventing separation, we modify the three-dimensional ($3$-D) dynamics to exploit wake vortices for aerodynamic enhancements. A direct wake modification is considered using optimal harmonic forcing modes from triglobal resolvent analysis. For this study, we consider wings at angles of attack of $14^\circ$ and $22^\circ$, taper ratios $0.27$ and $1$, and leading edge sweep angles of $0^\circ$ and $30^\circ$, at a mean-chord-based Reynolds number of $600$. The wakes behind these wings exhibit $3$-D reversed-flow bubble and large-scale vortical structures. For tapered swept wings, the diversity of wake vortices increases substantially, posing a challenge for flow control. To achieve the first control objective for an untapered unswept wing, root-based actuation at the shedding frequency is introduced to reduce the reversed-flow bubble size by taking advantage of the wake vortices to significantly enhance the aerodynamic performance of the wing. For both untapered and tapered swept wings, root-based actuation modifies the stalled flow, reduces the reversed-flow region, and enhances aerodynamic performance by increasing the root contribution to lift. For the goal of controlling the tip vortex, we demonstrate the effectiveness of actuation with high-frequency perturbations near the tip. This study shows how insights from resolvent analysis for unsteady actuation can enable global modification of $3$-D separated wakes and achieve improved aerodynamics of wings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing capabilities of particle image/tracking velocimetry with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving inverse problems, which means obtaining model parameters from observed data, using conventional computational fluid dynamics solvers is prohibitively expensive. Here we employ machine learning algorithms to overcome the challenge. As an example, we consider a moderately turbulent fluid flow, excited by a stationary force and described by a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with linear bottom friction. Given sparse and probably noisy data for the velocity and the general form of the model, we reconstruct the dense velocity and pressure fields in the observation domain, infer the driving force, and determine the unknown fluid viscosity and friction coefficient. Our approach involves training a physics-informed neural network by minimizing the loss function, which penalizes deviations from the provided data and violations of the Navier-Stokes equation. The suggested technique extracts additional information from experimental and numerical observations, potentially enhancing the capabilities of particle image/tracking velocimetry.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of rotating convection due to Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects arising from variations in thermal expansivity are theoretically and numerically studied in the context of rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection under two-dimensional (2D) configuration. The thermal expansivity increases with pressure (depth), and its variation is measured by a dimensionless factor $\epsilon$. Utilizing an asymptotic expansion with weak nonlinearity, we derive an amplitude equation, revealing that NOB effects amplify the magnitude of convection. An order-$\epsilon^2$ NOB correction leads to a symmetry breaking about the horizontal mid-plane, manifested in the strengthening of convection near the bottom and its weakening near the top, forming a bottom-heavy profiles. At order $\epsilon^3$, the conjunction of NOB effects and nonlinear advection leads to a horizontal symmetry breaking. The downward cold plumes become stronger and more concentrated compared to the upward warm plumes. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses in the weak nonlinear regime and confirm robust horizontal asymmetry and stronger downward plumes at very large Rayleigh numbers. This work advances our understanding of hydrothermal plumes in some winter lakes on Earth, and in the subglacial oceans on icy moons as well as tracer transport from the seafloor to the ice shell.</description>

      <title>Freely Decaying Saffman Turbulence Experimentally Generated by Magnetic Stirrers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the decay of three-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence, initially generated by the erratic motions of centimeter-size magnetic stirrers in a closed container. Such zero-mean-flow homogeneous isotropic turbulence is well suited to test Saffman's model and Batchelor's model of freely decaying turbulence. Here, we report a consistent set of experimental measurements (temporal decay of the turbulent kinetic energy, of the energy dissipation rate, and growth of the integral scale) strongly supporting the Saffman model. We also measure the conservation of the Saffman invariant at early times of the decay and show that the energy spectrum scales as $k^{2}$ at large scales and keeps its self-similar shape during the decay. This letter thus presents the first experimental evidence of the validity of the connection between the Saffman invariant and the $k^{2}$-energy spectrum of the large scales. The final decay regime closely corresponds to Saffman's model when the container size is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Two applications of stochastic thermodynamics to hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the theoretical framework of stochastic thermodynamics has been revealed to be useful for macroscopic systems. However, despite its conceptual and practical importance, the connection to hydrodynamics has yet to be explored. In this Letter, we reformulate the thermodynamics of compressible and incompressible Newtonian fluids so that it becomes comparable to stochastic thermodynamics and unveil their connections; we obtain the housekeeping--excess decomposition of entropy production rate (EPR) for hydrodynamic systems and find a lower bound on EPR given by relative fluctuation similar to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. These results not only prove the universality of stochastic thermodynamics but also suggest the potential extensibility of the thermodynamic theory of hydrodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-aware Machine Learning Revolutionizes Scientific Paradigm for Machine Learning and Process-based Hydrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate hydrological understanding and water cycle prediction are crucial for addressing scientific and societal challenges associated with the management of water resources, particularly under the dynamic influence of anthropogenic climate change. Existing reviews predominantly concentrate on the development of machine learning (ML) in this field, yet there is a clear distinction between hydrology and ML as separate paradigms. Here, we introduce physics-aware ML as a transformative approach to overcome the perceived barrier and revolutionize both fields. Specifically, we present a comprehensive review of the physics-aware ML methods, building a structured community (PaML) of existing methodologies that integrate prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into ML. We systematically analyze these PaML methodologies with respect to four aspects: physical data-guided ML, physics-informed ML, physics-embedded ML, and physics-aware hybrid learning. PaML facilitates ML-aided hypotheses, accelerating insights from big data and fostering scientific discoveries. We first conduct a systematic review of hydrology in PaML, including rainfall-runoff hydrological processes and hydrodynamic processes, and highlight the most promising and challenging directions for different objectives and PaML methods. Finally, a new PaML-based hydrology platform, termed HydroPML, is released as a foundation for hydrological applications. HydroPML enhances the explainability and causality of ML and lays the groundwork for the digital water cycle's realization. The HydroPML platform is publicly available at https://hydropml.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Deep FBSDE Neural Networks for Solving Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equation and Cahn-Hilliard Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to the curse of dimensionality. We extend the forward-backward stochastic neural networks (FBSNNs) which depends on forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) to solve incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. For Cahn-Hilliard equation, we derive a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation from a widely used stabilized scheme for original Cahn-Hilliard equation. This equation can be written as a continuous parabolic system, where FBSDE can be applied and the unknown solution is approximated by neural network. Also our method is successfully developed to Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equation. The accuracy and stability of our methods are shown in many numerical experiments, specially in high dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In industrial and environmental monitoring, achieving real-time and precise fluid flow measurement remains a critical challenge. This study applies linear quantization in FPGA-based soft sensors for fluid flow estimation, significantly enhancing Neural Network model precision by overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed-point quantization. Our approach achieves up to a 10.10% reduction in Mean Squared Error and a notable 9.39% improvement in inference speed through targeted hardware optimizations. Validated across multiple data sets, our findings demonstrate that the optimized FPGA-based quantized models can provide efficient, accurate real-time inference, offering a viable alternative to cloud-based processing in pervasive autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling fibrous tissue in vascular fluid-structure interaction: a morphology-based pipeline and biomechanical significance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a suite of technologies for analyzing the interaction between anisotropic arterial walls and blood flow for subject-specific geometries. Utilizing an established lumen modeling strategy, we present a comprehensive pipeline for generating the thick-walled artery models. Through a specialized mesh generation procedure, we obtain the meshes for the arterial lumen and wall with mesh continuity across the interface ensured. Exploiting the centerline information, a series of procedures is introduced for generating local basis vectors within the arterial wall. The procedures are tailored to handle thick-walled and, in particular, aneurysmatic tissues in which the basis vectors may exhibit transmural variations. Additionally, we propose methods to accurately identify the centerline in multi-branched vessels and bifurcating regions. The developed fiber generation method is evaluated against the strategy using linear elastic analysis, demonstrating that the proposed approach yields satisfactory fiber definitions in the considered benchmark. Finally, we examine the impact of anisotropic arterial wall models on the vascular fluid-structure interaction analysis through numerical examples. For comparison purposes, the neo-Hookean model is considered. The first case involves an idealized curved geometry, while the second case studies an image-based abdominal aorta model. The numerical results reveal that the deformation and stress distribution are critically related to the constitutive model of the wall, while the hemodynamic factors are less sensitive to the wall model. This work paves the way for more accurate image-based vascular modeling and enhances the prediction of arterial behavior under physiologically realistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously construct the first steady traveling wave solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation that take the form of a contiguous vortex-patch dipole, which can be viewed as the vortex-patch counterpart of the well-known Lamb-Chaplygin dipole. Our construction is based on a novel fixed-point approach that determines the patch boundary as the fixed point of a certain nonlinear map. Smoothness and other properties of the patch boundary are also obtained.</description>
