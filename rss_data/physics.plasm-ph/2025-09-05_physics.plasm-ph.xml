      <title>Thermodynamically consistent modelling and simulation of two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposes a thermodynamically consistent two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic model based on the Helmholtz free energy framework, which strictly satisfies both the principles of energy conservation and entropy increase in the two-fluid model. By constructing the convexe-concave characteristics of the free energy density (convexity with respect to plasma number density and concavity with respect to temperature), the model self-consistently derives key thermodynamic quantities such as chemical potential, entropy density, and internal energy. Based on the proposed modeling framework and the convex-concave properties of the Helmholtz free energy density, we develop a temporally discrete numerical scheme with thermodynamic consistency. We rigorously prove that the proposed method satisfies the first law of thermodynamics (global energy conservation) and the second law (non-decreasing total entropy). Additionally, we provide spatiotemporal error estimates for the 2D degenerate system used in practical computations. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing key plasma phenomena.</description>

      <title>Is There an Exact Magnetic-Moment for Charged Particle Motion in a Homogeneous, Time-Dependent Magnetic Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonperturbative guiding-center model provides an exact alternative to full-orbit simulations of charged particle dynamics in situations where traditional guiding-center theory may fail. We demonstrate that the charged particle motion in a homogeneous, time-varying magnetic field is a solvable example of the nonperturbative guiding-center model. This entails showing that the exact magnetic moment of Qin and Davidson can be constructed to be asymptotic to the adiabatic invariant series of Kruskal. In contrast to the perturbative invariant, the exact invariant contains information about parametric resonances. These resonances destroy the conservation of the usual magnetic moment over very long times. This refutes some previous claims about the all-time invariance of the magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependence of magnetron sputtering: 2D-RZ particle-in-cell and 1D fluid modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reproduce the consistently-seen experimental voltage versus pressure (V-P) dependence of DC magnetron sputtering (DCMS) with 2D-RZ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. Informed by PIC simulation, we develop a steady-state, 1D-axial fluid model of the sheath and presheath that also reproduces this V-P dependence. The V-P dependence is the relationship between the steady-state voltage needed to maintain a constant discharge current and the neutral gas pressure. V-P dependence is fundamental to device performance, but has not previously been reproduced with simulation or satisfactorily explained. In this work, we compare the V-P curve of our simulated device and fluid model with past experiments and then present a theoretical explanation for this V-P dependence. We find that the decrease in voltage with increasing pressure is not due to electron recapture at the cathode. Rather, the constant current dictates a constant global ionization rate, so the voltage decrease compensates for the increase in neutral gas density by lowering the energy of the plasma electrons, which decreases their ionization probability. The PIC simulations also reveal that the presheath and bulk plasma are unaffected by the electron reflection coefficient at the cathode; the only effect of increasing reflection is a reduction in the sheath voltage and width. In addition to the potential structure, we explore how pressure affects the plasma density, particle drifts, and particle energy distributions.</description>

      <title>Plasma wakefield: from accelerators to black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commemorating the 2024 S. Chandrasekhar Prize, this review provides a retrospective on the genesis and evolution of plasma wakefield acceleration. It traces the journey from prehistory and the invention of the Plasma Wakefield Accelerator (PWFA), the establishment of its theoretical cornerstones, to its profound reverberations across fundamental physics, including astrophysics and analog gravity. The narrative emphasizes conceptual evolution, key theoretical breakthroughs, and future outlook, culminating in a vision for hybrid schemes and next-generation colliders. In addition to application to particle accelerators and high energy collider physics, it is found that plasma wakefield, with its ultra-intense acceleration, can also be applied to investigate gravity effects in the laboratory based on Einstein's equivalence principle. A specific example is accelerating flying relativistic plasma mirrors to investigate the celebrated black hole Hawking evaporation and the associated information loss paradox. We describe an ongoing experiment, AnaBHEL (Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers), which aims at shedding some lights on the black hole information loss paradox.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian features of turbulent transport in tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the Lagrangian properties of ion turbulent transport driven by drift-type turbulence in tokamak plasmas. Despite the compressible and inhomogeneous nature of Eulerian gyrocenter drifts, numerical simulations with the T3ST code reveal approximate ergodicity, stationarity, and time-symmetry. These characteristics are attributed to broad initial phase-space distributions that support ergodic mixing. Moreover, relatively minor constraints on the initial distributions are found to have negligible effects on transport levels.</description>

      <title>Energy Confinement Time Scaling for the Negative Triangularity Scenario in DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results from the 2023 negative triangularity campaign on DIII-D demonstrate encouraging energy confinement properties, similar to or exceeding the scaling of the IPB98(y,2) law. This paper describes the procedure with which a new scaling law was regressed specifically from the data from the DIII-D campaign. Given the relatively small size of the single-machine dataset, measures were taken to minimize sampling bias and give a realistic estimate of the large uncertainties from the regression. The resulting power law shows a robustly stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation as compared to the H-mode scaling law.</description>

      <title>Assessing time-dependent temperature profile predictions using reduced transport models for high performing NSTX plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent, predictive simulations were performed with the 1.5D tokamak integrated modeling code TRANSP on a large set of well-analyzed, high performing discharges from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) in order to evaluate how well modern reduced transport models can reproduce experimentally observed temperature profiles in spherical tokamaks. Overall, it is found that simulations using the Multi-Mode Model (MMM) more consistently agree with the NSTX observations than those using the Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) model, despite TGLF requiring orders of magnitude greater computational cost. When considering all examined discharges, MMM has median overpredictions of electron temperature ($T_e$) and ion temperature ($T_i$) profiles of 28% and 27%, respectively, relative to the experiment. TGLF overpredicts $T_e$ by 46%, with much larger variance than MMM, and underpredicts $T_i$ by 25%. As $\beta$ is increased across NSTX discharges, TGLF predicts lower $T_e$ and significant flattening of the $T_i$ profile, conflicting with NSTX observations. When using an electrostatic version of TGLF, both $T_e$ and $T_i$ are substantially overpredicted, underscoring the importance of electromagnetic turbulence in the high $\beta$ spherical tokamak regime. Additionally, calculations with neural net surrogate models for TGLF were performed outside of TRANSP with a time slice flux matching transport solver, finding better agreement with experiment than the TRANSP simulations, highlighting the impact of different transport solvers and simulation techniques. Altogether, the reasonable agreement with experiment of temperature profiles predicted by MMM motivates a more detailed examination of the sensitivities of the TRANSP simulations with MMM to different NSTX plasma regimes in a companion paper, in preparation for self-consistent, time-dependent predictive modeling of NSTX-U scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sensitivities of time-dependent temperature profile predictions for NSTX with the Multi-Mode Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Mode Model (MMM) for turbulent transport was applied to a large set of well-analyzed discharges from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) in order to evaluate its sensitivities to a wide range of plasma conditions. MMM calculations were performed for hundreds of milliseconds in each discharge by performing time-dependent predictive simulations with the 1.5D tokamak integrated modeling code TRANSP. A closely related study concluded that MMM predicted electron ($T_e$) and ion ($T_i$) temperature profiles that were in reasonable agreement with NSTX observations, generally outperforming a different reduced transport model, TGLF, motivating a more thorough investigation of the characteristics of the MMM predictions. The simulations with MMM have electron energy transport dominated by electron temperature gradient modes for relatively low plasma $\beta$ and high collisionality, transitioning to a mixture of different modes for higher $\beta$ and lower collisionality. The thermal ion diffusivity predicted by MMM is much smaller than the neoclassical contribution, in line with previous experimental analysis of NSTX. Nonetheless, the $T_e$ and $T_i$ profiles are coupled via collisional energy exchange and thus sensitive to which transport channels are predicted. The simulations with MMM are robust to the simulation start time, converging to remarkably similar temperatures later during the discharge. MMM typically overpredicts confinement relative to NSTX observations, leading to the prediction of overly steep profiles. Plasmas with spatially broader $T_e$ profiles, higher $\beta$, and longer energy confinement times tend to be predicted by MMM with better agreement with the experiment. These findings provide useful context for understanding the regime-dependent tendencies of MMM in anticipation of self-consistent, time-dependent predictive simulations of NSTX-U discharges.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Effective Viscosity to Quantify Collisional Behavior in Collisionless Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dissipation in collisional plasma is defined in terms of viscosity and resistivity, the exact functional form of dissipation i.e., the so-called dissipation function in nearly collisionless plasma is unknown. Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that there exists viscous-like energy conversion in collisionless plasma with scaling characteristics analogous to collisional plasma, and in particular that the average dissipation is proportional to the square of the rate of strain as in hydrodynamics. In this study, using 2.5D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of collisionless plasma turbulence, we provide an estimate of effective viscosity at each scale, obtained via a scale-filtering approach. We then compare the turbulent dynamics of the PIC simulation with that from MHD and two-fluid simulations in which with the viscosity is equal to the effective viscosity estimate obtained from the PIC simulation. We find that the global behavior in these MHD and two-fluid simulations has a striking similarity with that in its kinetic/PIC counterpart. In addition, we explore the scale dependence of the effective viscosity, and discuss implications of this approach for space plasmas.</description>

      <title>The nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale convective flows of magnetized plasma, generated by the inhomogeneous microturbulenc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale two-dimensional compressed-sheared non-diffusive convective flows of a magnetized plasma generated by the inhomogeneous microturbulence. This theory bases on the two-scales approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations for magnetized plasma, in which the self-consistent evolution of the plasma and of the electrostatic field on the microscales, commensurable with the wavelength of the microscale instabilities and of the ion gyroradius, as well as on the macroscales of a bulk of plasma, is accounted for. It includes the theory of the formation of the macroscale spatially inhomogeneous compressed-sheared convective flows by the inhomogeneous microturbulence, the theory of the back reaction of the macroscale convected flows on the microturbulence, and of the slow macroscale responce of a bulk of plasma on the development of the compressed-sheared convective flows.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Multi-Machine Scaling Laws for Fuel and Impurity Puffing Rates Sufficient for Detachment Access: a Systematic Review of Magnetic Confinement Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a database of 457 experimental and numerical data from 32 machines among solid-walled tokamaks, stellarators and linear plasma devices, we derive physics-informed multi-machine scaling laws predictive of fuel and impurity puffing rates sufficient to access plasma detachment -- leading candidate for a reactor-relevant solution to the open issue of plasma-wall interaction. Validation of our laws in up to 40 plasmas in low- and high-confinement mode also featuring advanced configurations demonstrates accuracy within a factor 1.5 in up to 50% of the instances, and within a factor 2 on average. Divertor volume alone is found to correlate to fuelling. The addition of plasma opaqueness leads to the empirically-calibrated law $\Gamma_{\text{D}}\propto [n_{\text{sep}}\times a\times(S_{\text{div}}/V_{\text{div}})^{-1.5}]^{1.05}$ valid across all toroidal devices. Its simplification to $\Gamma_{\text{D}}^{\text{HDL}}\propto 0.43\times a^{1.58}\times\lambda_q^{-0.89}$ avoids a dependence on $n_{\text{sep}}$ and bears intrinsic significance provided by the H/L density limit and the power fall-off length. Non-linearities of the impurity dynamics manifest in the seeding rate -- which the present work identifies both a generalised formula for, and the Greenwald-Eich-Scarabosio simplification $\Gamma_{\text{Z}}^{\text{GES}}\propto a^{1.51}\times\lambda_q^{-0.27}$. Similar relationships are defined for stellarators, closely following the mainstream but without providing data for validation -- which should stimulate further investigations. In the era of nuclear fusion reactor design, these results find immediate applicability in informing reactor fuel cycle design and edge plasma modelling. More generally, this study demonstrates that physics-based 0D laws able to relate detachment to the engineering actuators exist.</description>
