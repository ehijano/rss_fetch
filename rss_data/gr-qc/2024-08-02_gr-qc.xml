      <title>Cosmography in $f(Q,T)$ gravity with the specific $H(z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of perfect fluid as a source in the context of modified gravity, specifically $f(Q,T)$ gravity, are examined within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model. This gravity is a generic function of the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and its trace $T$. We investigate the characteristics of the derived cosmological model using a parameterized form of Hubble's parameter, $H(z) = H_0\left[\Omega_{0m}(1+z)^3 + (1-\Omega_{0m})\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}$ (Mahmood et al. Int. J. Geom. Methods Mod. Phys., https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219887824502049). Our examination reveals how physical parameters such as energy density, pressure, and the equation of state parameter, among others, in our model accurately describe the physical behavior of the cosmos. Furthermore, we explore the kinematic parameters in our model, which provide valuable insights into the cosmos's expansion history, including its acceleration, deceleration, and the evolution of its large-scale structure. By exploring these aspects, we gain a deeper understanding of the cosmos's dynamics and evolution within the context of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Electric Penrose process and the accretion disk around a 4D charged Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to examine the electric Penrose process (PP) around a charged black hole in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity and bring out the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling parameter $\alpha$ and black hole charge on the efficiency of the energy extraction from the black hole. This research is motivated by the fact that electrostatic interactions significantly influence the behavior of charged particles in the vicinity of a charged static black hole. Under this interaction, decaying charged particles can have negative energies, causing energy to be released from black holes with no ergosphere. We show that the GB coupling parameter has a significant impact on the energy efficiency of the electric PP, but the efficiency can be strongly enhanced by the black hole charge due to the Coulomb force. Finally, we consider the accretion disk around the black hole and investigate in detail its radiation properties, such as the electromagnetic radiation flux, the temperature, and the differential luminosity. We show that the GB coupling parameter can have a significant impact on the radiation parameters, causing them to increase in the accretion disk in the vicinity of the black hole. Interestingly, it is found that the 4D EGB charged black hole is more efficient and favorable for the accretion disk radiation compared to a charged black hole in Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Strong gravity beyond General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the application of numerical relativity methods to the solutions of problems in strong gravity. Our goal is the study of mergers of compact objects in the strong field regime where non-linear dynamics manifest and deviations from General Relativity could be found. We develop a new formulation of the Einstein equations in d+1 spacetime dimensions in the moving punctures approach, which leads to a well-posed set of equations for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB), as well as for the most general parity-invariant scalar-tensor theory of gravity up to four derivatives (4$\partial$ST). Using this formulation, we have implemented the equations of the 4$\partial$ST theory in GRFolres, an open-source extension of our numerical relativity code GRChombo. This has enabled us to evolve equal and unequal-mass Binary Black Hole mergers in this effective field theory of gravity, as well as to study the loss of hyperbolicity and its relation to the weak coupling condition, among other topics of interest left for further study.</description>

      <title>Comments on graviton detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is possible to make a detector which clicks after absorbing a single graviton. Similarly, it is possible to make a gravitational wave detector which can see the quantum noise induced by certain highly squeezed states of the graviton. However, contrary to some recent arguments in the literature, observation of either or both of these signals would not constitute proof or even evidence that the gravitational field is quantized. This is a simple technical statement: a classical gravitational wave can produce the same output data in a detector. Here we explain this result, presented earlier in arXiv:2308.12988, which is a straightforward extension of an ancient argument in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Positive Mass in General Relativity Without Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in physics is why observed masses are always positive. While energy conditions in quantum field theory can partly answer this problem, in this paper we find evidence that classical general relativity abhors negative masses, without the need for quantum theory or energy conditions. This is done by considering many different models of negative-mass ``stars'' and showing they are dynamically unstable. \emph{A fortiori}, we show that any barotropic negative-mass star whose pressure is not a monotonically increasing function of the energy density must be dynamically unstable. Furthermore, we argue that all acceptable barotropic models of negative-mass stars must be in this class, and are thus unstable.</description>

      <title>Regular Kerr black holes: The fellowship of the string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their interesting article entitled "Kerrr" black hole: The lord of the string [Phys. Lett. B bf 688, 82 (2010)], Smailagic and Spallucci report on a regular Kerr-like black hole spacetime with a string in the central region. The metric is of the Kerr-Schild form with a particular mass function, that is chosen in order to avoid the ring singularity of the Kerr metric. However, as it is known, even for a class of well-behaved mass functions, the curvature scalars present a discontinuity in the equatorial plane at the ring. The authors associate such a discontinuity with the presence of a string of matter and join the interior and exterior regions of the string by making a particular choice of the orientations of the normal vectors at each side of the ring. Differently from what was interpreted by the authors, we show here that the string is not rotating in the scenario of that work. We also show that the choice regarding the normal vector orientation leads to a geometry that is not compatible with the center of a rotating black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime. We then consider all the four possible combinations of the normal vector orientation at each side of the ring and, by using the Darmois-Israel formalism, interpret each resulting solution. We show that, out of the four possibilities, only one of the four models for the thin shell solution at the ring yields the appropriate geometry. More importantly, this solution does not correspond to the one obtained by Smailagic and Spallucci. Finally, we also discuss a scenario where the string is indeed rotating.</description>

      <title>Shadow of a Renormalization Group Improved Regular Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on quantum gravity effects on the shadow of a regular rotating black hole (BH) obtained in the setting of the asymptotic safety (AS) gravity. We show that the rotating metric, which results from a static regular one recently presented in the literature, remains regular after being constructed using the generalized Newman-Janis (NJ) algorithm.. The novelty of the static regular metric lies in the fact that it is the outcome of an effective Lagrangian which describes dust whose spherically symmetric collapse is non-singular as a consequence of the antiscreening character of gravity at small distances. The effective Lagrangian includes a multiplicative coupling, denoted as chi, with the Lagrangian of the collapsing fluid. The resulting exterior metric for large radii depends on a free parameter xi which captures the quantum gravity effects. The form of the coupling chi and its connection with the quantum parameter xi are determined by the running of the Newton coupling G(k) along a renormalization group trajectory that stops at the ultraviolet (UV) non-gaussian fixed point of the AS theory. Varying both the spin parameter a/M and the quantum parameter xi, we explore the quantum gravity effects on several astronomical observables used to describe the shadow features of rotating BHs. In order to obtain constraints on the parameter xi, we confront our results with the recent EHT observations of the shadows of the supermassive BHs M87 and Sgr A. We find that the ranges of variation of all the studied shadow observables fall entirely within the ranges determined by the EHT collaboration. We then conclude that the current astronomical data do not rule out the renormalization group improved regular rotating BH.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Anisotropic Buchdahl's Relativistic Models in $f(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{T})$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs three different anisotropic extensions of the existing isotropic solution to the modified field equations through the gravitational decoupling in $f(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{T})$ theory. For this, we take a static sphere that is initially filled with the isotropic fluid and then add a new gravitational source producing anisotropy in the system. The field equations now correspond to the total matter configuration. We transform the radial metric component to split these equations into two sets characterizing their parent sources. The unknowns comprising in the first set are determined by considering the Buchdahl isotropic solution. On the other hand, we employ different constraints related to the additional gravitational source and make the second system solvable. Further, the constant triplet in Buchdahl solution is calculated by means of matching criteria between the interior and exterior geometries at the spherical boundary. The mass and radius of a compact star LMC X-4 are used to analyze the physical relevancy of the developed models. We conclude that our resulting models II and III are in well-agreement with acceptability conditions for the considered values of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Recalculating Total Number of e-folds in Loop Quantum Cosmology in View of Generalized Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In loop quantum cosmology, the slow-roll inflation is generic, and when the kinetic energy of the scalar field dominates at the bounce, the evolution of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe will go through three distinguishable epochs, bouncing, transition, and finally slow-roll inflation, before the reheating commences. The bouncing dynamics are insensitive of the potential and initial conditions, so that the expansion factor and the scalar field can be described uniquely by a universal solution during this epoch. After about $10^5$ Planck time, the epoch of transition starts and the universe rapidly turns over from the kinetic energy dominated state to the potential energy dominated one, whereby the slow-roll inflationary phase begins. In this paper, we consider the power law plateau potential and study the pre-inflationary cosmology for different sets of initial conditions, so that during the slow-roll inflation epoch enough e-folds will be produced. Considering the generalized reheating and comparing with the recent Planck 2018 data, we are able to constrain the total number of e-folds ($N_T$) from the bounce till today to be consistent with the current observable universe. Depending on the matter driving the reheating (subject to the different dominant equations of states), we report the observationally allowed $N_T$ and reheating temperature and find in particular $N_T \simeq 127$, which is significantly different from the one $N_T \gtrsim 141$ obtained previously without considering the reheating phase.</description>

      <title>Quasilocal Newtonian limit of general relativity and galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies, offering an explanation for their observed rotation curves. Halos of abundant cold dark matter particles are not required.</description>

      <title>The CR Volume for Black Holes and the Corresponding Entropy Variation: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the work done on black hole interior volume, entropy, and evaporation. An insight into the basics for understanding the interior volume is presented. A general analogy to investigate the interior volume of a black hole, the associated quantum mode's entropy, and the evolution relation between the interior and exterior entropy is explained. Using this analogy, we predicted the future of information stored in a BH, its radiation, and evaporation. The results are noted in tables (\ref{tab:1}) and (\ref{tab:2}). To apply this analogy in BH space-time, we investigated the interior volume, entropy, and evaluation relation for different types of BHs. Finally, we also investigated the nature of BH radiation and the probability of particle emission during the evaporation process.</description>

Abstract: Among the recent extensions to standard General Relativity, $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity has risen an interest given the possibility of coupling between geometry and matter. We examine the simplest model with non-minimal coupling in the context of cosmology. We pay special attention to the question of how far this model could reproduce the observational fact of our universe.</description>

      <title>Embedding Warm Natural Inflation in $f(\phi)T$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study warm inflation in the framework of $f(\phi)T$ gravity, where $\phi$ is the inflaton and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The inflaton field is assumed to roll on the natural potential and the result is analyzed in light of Planck 2018 and BICEP/Keck 2021 data. We start our work by obtaining the field equations under slow-roll approximations. We then evaluate the scalar and tensor power spectra and their corresponding spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio with a temperature-dependent form of the dissipation coefficient during the inflationary era. We find that the warm inflation model in $f(\phi)T$ gravity is compatible with observational bands.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling at Quantum Hall Interfaces and Their Analog to Black Hole Event Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole information paradox has been hotly debated for the last few decades without a full resolution. This makes it desirable to find analogues of this paradox in simple and experimentally accessible systems, whose resolutions may shed light on this longstanding and fundamental problem. Here, we review and resolve the apparent "information paradox" in two different interfaces separating Abelian and non-Abelian quantum Hall states. In both cases, the information carried by the pseudospin degree of freedom of the Abelian anyons get scrambled when they cross the interface and enter the non-Abelian quantum Hall liquid. Nevertheless, it is found that the scrambling mechanism depends on the nature of the interface. The corresponding analogues of different concepts in black hole physics such as event horizon, black hole interior, Hawking radiation, and Page curve will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Loops, Recursions, and Soft Limits for Fermionic Correlators in (A)dS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Study of correlation functions in AdS/CFT and in-in correlators in de Sitter space often requires the computation of Witten diagrams. Due to the complexity of evaluating radial integrals for these correlators, several indirect approaches have been developed to simplify computations. However, in momentum space, these methods have been limited to fields with integer spin. In this paper, we formulate tools for evaluating Witten diagrams with spin$-\frac12$ fields in momentum space and discuss where they differ from the corresponding integer-spin analysis. We formulate our tools explicitly for massless fermions and present how appropriate Weight shifting operators with respect to the external kinematics can be used to obtain the generalization to fermions with integer mass. We apply these tools to loop Witten diagrams and also discuss their use for evaluating in-in correlators in dS. In cases where we can evaluate the loop integrals, we find their transcendentality is lower than the corresponding scalar field results. Further, we classify the nature of IR divergences encountered for interacting massive scalars and fermions. We also prove a novel Weinberg-like soft theorem for gauge fields coupled to matter in AdS and show that the universal terms in the leading soft factor are sensitive to the spin of the matter field. These generalize the recently discovered soft theorems for pure Yang-Mills to Yang-Mills with matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Noetherian Conformal Cheshire Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational Cheshire effect refers to the possibility of turning off the gravitational field while still leaving an imprint of the nonminimal coupling of matter to gravity. This allows nontrivial solutions in flat spacetime for which no backreaction is possible. The effect was originally shown to manifest itself for standard nonminimal couplings, such as those allowing conventional conformally invariant scalar fields. Recently, the most general scalar field action yielding a conformally invariant second-order equation was constructed, and entails a more involved nonminimal coupling explicitly breaking the conformal invariance of the action without spoiling it in the equation. We have succeeded in fully describing the spherically symmetric stealth solutions on flat spacetime supporting the Cheshire effect within this general non-Noetherian conformal theory. The allowed configurations are divided into two branches: The first one essentially corresponds to an extension of the solutions already known for the standard Noetherian conformal theory. The second branch is only possible due to the non-Noetherian conformal contribution of the action. The complete characterization of this branch is expressed by a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation. We have found the general solution of this equation using both seemingly new and well-established mathematical tools.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Spin of the Galactic Center Supermassive Black Hole with Two Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a key science project of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the discovery and timing observations of radio pulsars in the Galactic Center would provide high-precision measurements of the spacetime around the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and initiate novel tests of general relativity. The spin of Sgr A* could be measured with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$ by timing one pulsar with timing precision that is achievable for the SKA. However, the real measurements depend on the discovery of a pulsar in a very compact orbit, $P_b\lesssim0.5\,{\rm yr}$. Here for the first time we propose and investigate the possibility of probing the spin of Sgr A* with two or more pulsars that are in orbits with larger orbital periods, $P_b\sim 2- 5\,{\rm yr}$, which represents a more realistic situation from population estimates. We develop a novel method for directly determining the spin of Sgr A* from the timing observables of two pulsars and it can be readily extended for combining more pulsars. With extensive mock data simulations, we show that combining a second pulsar improves the spin measurement by $2-3$ orders of magnitude in some situations, which is comparable to timing a pulsar in a very tight orbit.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Cosmological Research with the FAST Array: 21-cm Intensity Mapping Survey Observation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00268</link>

Abstract: Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FAST would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamics of a five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress on the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics for black holes in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space, we investiggate the hologrphic thermodynamics for the five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole in the context of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Through the extended bulk thermodynamics for the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole, we derive the first law of the CFT thermodynamics which is obtained by directly translating the arbitrary conformal factors in the dual CFT. In addition to the newly defined chemical potential $\mu$ conjugating to the central charge $C$, we obtain other pairs of thermodynamics for the CFT, such as the temperature $\tilde{T}$ and the entropy $S$, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\tilde{\alpha}$ and its conjugate variable $ \tilde{\mathcal{A}}$, the pressure $\mathcal{P}$ and its conjugate volume $\mathcal{V}$. In the fixed $C$, $\mathcal{V}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ canonical ensemble, we obtain the canonical description of the CFT thermodynamics and observe the standard swallowtail behavior in the Helmholtz free energy vs the temperature plot. The self-intersection point of the Helmholtz free energy indicates the phase transition between the high and low entropy states of the CFT. By using Maxwell's equal area law, we get the critical point and coexistence curve for the high and low entropy phases of the CFT. Besides, we get the critical exponents for the CFT, and find that the critical point and critical exponents associated with the $\tilde{T}-S$ criticality of the CFT are the same as those of the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Speed of Gravity and the Cosmic Expansion with Time Delays between Gravity and Light from Binary Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first observation of a gravitational wave (GW) and a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) emitted by the same binary neutron star (BNS) merger officially opened the field of GW multi-messenger astronomy. In this paper, we define and address \textit{lagging sirens}, a new class of multi-messenger BNSs for which associated GWs and sGRBs are observed without the identification of their host galaxy. We propose a new methodology to use the observed time delay of these sources to constrain the speed of gravity that is, the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the Hubble constant and the prompt time delay distribution between GWs and sGRBs, even though a direct redshift estimation from the host galaxy is unavailable. Our method exploits the intrinsic relation between GWs and sGRBs observed and prompt time delays to obtain a statistical redshift measure for the cosmological sources. We show that this technique can be used to infer the Hubble constant at the $10\%$~level of precision with future-generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and only 100 observations of this kind. The novel procedure that we propose has systematics that differ completely from the ones of previous GW methods for cosmology. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time that the speed of gravity and the distribution of the prompt time-delays between GWs and sGRBs can be inferred conjointly with less than 10 sources even with current GW detector sensitivities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmological neutrino-dominated accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) based on the results of our fallback core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. We find that the predicted SGWB is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the SGWB from NDAFs without disk outflows might be detected by next-generation space-based interferometers such as Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and Big Bang Observer (BBO). In the low-frequency regime $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz, this background is comparable to that expected from standard inflationary models. Therefore, the SGWB from NDAFs may become a foreground for searches of the SGWB generated in the inflationary epoch. Combining the diffuse NDAF neutrino background and SGWB from NDAFs, one may constrain the properties of the CCSNe and NDAFs.</description>

      <title>Spinning waveforms in cubic effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive analytic all-order-in-spin expressions for the leading-order time-domain waveforms generated in the scattering of two Kerr black holes with arbitrary masses and spin vectors in the presence of all independent cubic deformations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. These are the two parity-even interactions $I_1$ and $G_3$, and the parity-odd ones $\tilde{I}_1$ and $\tilde{G}_3$. Our results are obtained using three independent methods: a particularly efficient direct integration and tensor reduction approach; integration by parts combined with the method of differential equations; and finally a residue computation. For the case of the $G_3$ and $\tilde{G}_3$ deformations we can express the spinning waveform in terms of the scalar waveform with appropriately shifted impact parameters, which are reminiscent of Newman-Janis shifts. For $I_1$ and $\tilde{I}_1$ similar shifts occur, but are accompanied by additional contributions that cannot be captured by simply shifting the scalar $I_1$ and $\tilde{I}_1$ waveforms. We also show the absence of leading-order corrections to gravitational memory. Our analytic results are notably compact, and we compare the effectiveness of the three methods used to obtain them. We also briefly comment on the magnitude of the corrections to observables due to cubic deformations.</description>

Abstract: We explore the multi-scatter capturing of the massive dark matter (DM) particle inside the neutron star via a momentum-dependent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section. We find that the capturing enhanced for the positive velocity and momentum transfer dependent DM-nucleon scattering in comparison with the constant cross-section case. Further, a large capture of the DM particles can be thermalized and lead to black hole formation and, therefore, destroy the neutron star. Using the observation of the old neutron star in the DM-dominated region, we obtain strong constraints on massive DM parameters.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz gravitational waves from a quasar-based supermassive black hole binary population model as dark sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have detected evidence of the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, providing confidence in detecting individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the future. Nanohertz GWs emitted by inspiraling SMBHBs encode the luminosity distances of SMBHBs. They can serve as dark sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history via a statistical method to obtain the redshift information of GW sources' host galaxies using galaxy catalogs. The theoretical analysis of the dark siren method relies on the modeling of the population of SMBHBs. Using a population model consistent with the latest SGWB observations is essential, as the SGWB provides significant information about the distribution of SMBHBs. In this work, we employ a quasar-based model, which can self-consistently account for the SGWB amplitude, to estimate the population of SMBHBs. We constrain the Hubble constant using the mock GW data from different detection cases of PTAs in the future. Our results show that a PTA consisting of 100 pulsars with a white noise level of 20 ns could measure the Hubble constant with a precision close to $1\%$ over a 10-year observation period, and a PTA with 200 pulsars may achieve this goal over a 5-year observation period. The results indicate that modeling the SMBHB population significantly influences the analysis of dark sirens, and SMBHB dark sirens have the potential to be developed as a valuable cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters on oscillation modes in hot Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that certain nuclear parameters are more dominant than others in governing global neutron star properties, such as its structure or oscillation mode characteristics. Although neutron stars can in general assumed to be cold, in astrophysical scenarios such as newly born neutron stars or remnants of binary neutron star mergers, finite temperature effects play a non-negligible role. In this work, we perform a consistent and systematic investigation of the role of nuclear parameters and thermal effects on neutron star properties and fluid oscillation modes within a full general relativistic scheme. We impose constraints on the parameter space of the relativistic mean field model using state-of-the-art information from terrestrial experiments and multi-messenger astrophysical data. We find effective nucleon mass to be the most important nuclear parameter controlling astrophysical observables of hot neutron stars, similar to the cold beta equilibrated matter. However, we conclude that the interplay among saturation properties and astrophysical observables depends not only on the thermal configurations considered but also on the constraints imposed. We also investigated the role of nuclear saturation parameters on some universal relations for hot NSs which are important in gravitational wave asteroseismology. Our investigation confirmed that these relations are mostly insensitive to nuclear saturation properties and mainly affected by variation of charge fraction in the star.</description>

Abstract: The theory of cosmic inflation has received a great amount of deserved attention in recent years due to it's stunning predictions about the early universe. Alongside the usual cold inflation paradigm, warm inflation has garnered a huge amount of interest in modern inflationary studies. It's peculiar features and specifically different predictions from cold inflation have led to a substantial amount of literature about it. Various modified cosmological scenarios have also been studied in the warm inflationary regime. In this work, we introduce the exact solution approach for warm inflation. This approach allows one to directly study warm inflationary regime in a variety of modified cosmological scenarios. We begin by outlining our method and show that it generalizes the modified Friedmann approach of Del Campo , and reduces to the well known Hamilton-Jacobi formalism for inflation in particular limits. We also find the perturbation spectra for cosmological and tensor perturbations in the early universe, and then apply our method to study warm inflation in a Tsallis entropy modified Friedmann universe. We end our paper with some concluding remarks on the domain of applicability of our work.</description>

      <title>Answers to frequently asked questions about the pulsar timing array Hellings and Downs curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the Hellings and Downs correlation curve -- the "smoking-gun" signature that pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have detected gravitational waves (GWs). Many of these questions arise from inadvertently applying intuition about the effects of GWs on LIGO-like detectors to the case of pulsar timing, where not all of it applies. This is because Earth-based detectors, like LIGO and Virgo, have arms that are short (km scale) compared to the wavelengths of the GWs that they detect (approx 100-10,000 km). In contrast, PTAs respond to GWs whose wavelengths (tens of light-years) are much shorter than their arms (a typical PTA pulsar is hundreds to thousands of light-years from Earth). To demonstrate this, we calculate the time delay induced by a passing GW along an Earth-pulsar baseline (a "one-arm, one-way" detector) and compare it in the "short-arm" (LIGO-like) and "long-arm" (PTA) limits. This provides qualitative and quantitative answers to many questions about the Hellings and Downs curve. The resulting FAQ sheet should help in understanding the "evidence for GWs" recently announced by several PTA collaborations.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of understanding the mysteries surrounding dark energy has sparked significant interest within the field of cosmology. While conventional approaches, such as the cosmological constant, have been extensively explored, alternative theories incorporating scalar field-based models and modified gravity have emerged as intriguing avenues. Among these, teleparallel theories of gravity, specifically the $f(T,\phi)$ formulation, have gained prominence as a means to comprehend dark energy within the framework of teleparallelism. In this study, we investigate two well-studied models of teleparallel dark energy and examine the presence of cosmological singularities within these scenarios. Using the Goriely-Hyde procedure, we examine the dynamical systems governing the cosmological equations of these models. Our analysis reveals that both models exhibit Type IV singularities, but only for a limited range of initial conditions. These results could indicate a potential edge for teleparallel cosmological models over their other modified gravity counterparts, as the models we examine seem to be only allowing for weak singularities that too under non general conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and introduce the BEC vortex in $1+2$ dimensions. We focus on two types of gapped excitations induced by the modes of two-component BECs with relative phases of $0$ and $\pi$, analogous to the massive scalar field with positive and negative mass squared, respectively. The inclusion of space-dependent Rabi coupling can induce an effective space-dependent mass term. We study superradiant instabilities resulting from the quasibound states corresponding to positive mass squared and the tachyonic instabilities arising from negative mass squared in both the frequency and time domains. These instabilities resemble two possible mechanisms that make Kerr black holes unstable in scalar-tensor gravity with the presence of matter around the black hole. Our proposed phenomena could potentially be implemented in future experiments, drawing from the success of recent analog rotating black hole implementations.</description>

      <title>Late-time tail and echoes of Damour-Solodukhin wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Damour-Solodukhin wormholes are intriguing theoretical constructs, closely mimicking many properties of black holes. This study delves into two distinct characteristics of the waveforms emitted from such wormholes, namely, the late-time tails and echoes, which can substantially be used to distinguish its identity. Notably, both features appear in the latter stages of quasinormal oscillations and stem from the singularities of the Green's function. The late-time tail, on the one hand, arises due to the branch cuts in the relevant Green's function. Within the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole paradigm, singularities are present in both ingoing and outgoing waveforms, which entails a generalization of the existing recipe for black hole metrics. On the other hand, the echoes are attributed to a new set of quasinormal poles, supplementing those of the respective black holes, reminiscent of the scenario where the spacetime metric possesses a discontinuity. It is inferred that both features are observationally relevant in distinguishing a wormhole from its black hole counterpart. Moreover, we suggest a potential interplay concerning the late-time evolution between the two mechanisms in question.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of renormalization group improved gravity from the kinematics of SPARC galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR) proposes a logarithmic running of the gravitational coupling $\left(G\right)$, resulting in a modified description of gravity. This has the potential to explain the observed kinematics of the galaxies, including the missing-mass problem. We, for the first time, based on the galaxy morphological types, investigate the dynamics of a diverse collection of galaxies present in the Spitzer Photometry for Accurate Rotation Curve (SPARC) catalog. We phenomenologically constrain the RGGR model parameter $\left(\bar\nu\right)$ along with the mass-to-light ratio for a sample of 100 SPARC galaxies, selected from four different morphological types, viz. early, spiral, late, and starburst. Our statistical analysis finds RGGR to fit the observed galaxy kinematics consistently. The constrained RGGR model parameter also supports the claim that it has a near-linear dependence on the galactic baryonic mass. From our morphology study, we find that the parameter $\bar\nu$ decreases from the early-type to the starburst galaxies. Finally, the renormalization group improved gravity is tested against the two established empirical relations for the SPARC catalog, viz., the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) and the Baryonic Tully Fisher relation (BTFR), both are found to be satisfied consistently.</description>

      <title>Dark energy as a geometrical effect in geodetic brane gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the modified geodetic brane gravity, conformed by the Regge-Teitelboim model and enhanced with a linear term in the extrinsic curvature of the brane, the possibility that under an FRW geometry this theory emulates the so-called dark energy is discussed. The cosmological behavior of this model displays a self-(non-self)-accelerated expansion of this universe which is caused by a combination of usual matter and gravitational geometric effects controlled by a $\beta$ parameter that accompanies the correction $K$ term. Indeed, the self-accelerated branch, provided by the trace $K$ model raises the question of whether the extrinsic curvature correction terms might be suitable for dark energy candidates. We discuss the analytical expression obtained for $\rd$ in addition to the main cosmological parameters such as the state parameter $\omega_{\text{\tiny eff}}$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. Moreover, when we call for the contribution of dark radiation-like energy to be switched off, $\Odr \to 0$, we find the same acceleration behavior, as well as the same dark energy content provided by the DGP theory. The relationship of our findings to the analysis for $\rd$ performed by Davidson and Gurwich within the unified brane cosmology is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>GW230529_181500: A Potential Primordial Binary Black Hole Merger in the Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected a coalescing compact binary, GW230529_181500, with component masses of $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ at the $90\%$ credible level. The gravitational-wave data alone is insufficient to determine whether the components are neutron stars or black holes. In this paper, we propose that GW230529_181500 originated from the merger of two primordial black holes (PBHs). We estimate a merger rate of $5.0^{+47.0}_{-4.9} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to GW230529_181500. Assuming the source is a PBH-PBH merger, GW230529-like events lead to approximately $1.7^{+36.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter in the form of PBHs. The required abundance of PBHs to explain this event is consistent with existing upper limits derived from microlensing, cosmic microwave background observations and the null detection of gravitational wave background by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Constraining a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in DHOST theories with the orbit of the S2 star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the observed data of the S2 orbit around the black hole Sgr A$^*$ and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we make a constraint on parameters of a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. This black hole belongs to a class of non-stealth solutions and owns an extra disformal parameter described the deviation from general relativity. Our results show that the best fit value of the disformal parameter is positive. However, in the range of $1\sigma$, we also find that general relativity remains to be consistent with the observation of the S2 orbit.</description>

      <title>Form Invariance of Raychaudhuri equation in the presence of Inflaton-type fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Raychaudhuri equation remains form invariant for certain solutions of scalar fields $\phi$ whose Lagrangian is non-canonical and of the form $\mathcal{L}(X,\phi)=-V(\phi)F(X)$, with $X=\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} \nabla^{\mu}\phi \nabla^{\nu} \phi$ and $V(\phi)$ the potential. Solutions exist for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields that are like inflatons. Certain recent observations indicate that the cosmos is inhomogeneous and thus our results are in sync with the latest observations. So the Raychaudhuri equation can accommodate primordial inhomogeneities as well as cosmologically relevant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Charged analogues of a singularity-free anisotropic compact star under linear $f(Q)$- action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study simulates the characteristics of spherically symmetric, anisotropic compact stellar bodies with electrical charge within the context of the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. Employing the Krori-Barua metric ansatz (K.D. Krori, J. Barua, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 8 (1975) 508) along with a linear form of $f(Q)$ model, {\it viz.}, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we obtain a tractable set of exact relativistic solutions of the field equations. A specific form of charge $(q=q_{0}r^{3})$ is considered here for the present analysis. Using the data sets of $\rho$ and $p_{r}$ along with the method of curve fitting, we have obtained the best fit equation of state in the model, which is incorporated in the numerical solutions of the TOV equations to determine the maximum mass and radius in this scenario. With increasing charge intensity $(q_{0})$ from 0.0002 to 0.0006, the maximum mass ranges from $2.838-2.869~M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding radii range from $12.0039-12.0822~Km$. Moreover, the predicted radii of some recently observed pulsars and GW 190814 show that our model also complies with the estimated radii based on the observational results. Our model is found to satisfy all the characteristic features, such as behaviour of matter variables, causality condition, energy constraints and stability criteria, which are pertinent in the context of a stable stellar configuration to emerge as a viable and physically acceptable stellar model in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the discovery of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a novel proof on this relation using a completely new geometric approach, in which the stable and unstable photon spheres are determined by Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of photon spheres near black holes with proper asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we proved that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis in this study is limited to the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime (with the spacetime metric $ds^{2}=g_{tt}dt^{2}+g_{rr}dr^{2}+g_{\theta\theta}d\theta^{2}+g_{\phi\phi}d\phi^{2}$).</description>

      <title>Resolving the Stellar-Collapse and Hierarchical-Merger origins of the Coalescing Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin and mass properties provide essential clues in distinguishing the origins of coalescing black holes (BHs). With a dedicated semiparametric population model for the coalescing binary black holes (BBHs), we identify two distinct categories of BHs among the GWTC-3 events, which is {favored over the one population scenario by} a logarithmic Bayes factor ($\ln\mathcal{B}$) of 7.5. One category, with a mass ranging from $\sim 25M_\odot$ to $\sim 80M_\odot$, is distinguished by the high spin magnitudes ($\sim0.75$) and consistent with the hierarchical merger origin. The other category, characterized by low spins, has a sharp mass cutoff at $\sim 40M_\odot$, which is natural for the stellar-collapse origin and in particular the pair-instability explosion of massive stars. We infer the local hierarchical merger rate density as $0.46^{+0.61}_{-0.24}~{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. Additionally, we find that a fraction of the BBHs has a cosine-spin-tilt-angle distribution concentrated preferentially around $1$, and the fully isotropic distribution for spin orientation is disfavored by a $\ln\mathcal{B}$ of -6.3, suggesting that the isolated field evolution channels are contributing to the total population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the dark matter(DM) production processes and its parameters space in the background of reheating obtained from two chief systems in the early Universe: the inflaton $\phi$ and the primordial black holes (PBHs). We concentrated on the mechanism where DMs are universally produced only from the PBH decay and the generation of the standard model plasma from both inflton and PBHs. Whereas the distribution of Primordial Black Holes behaves like dust, the inflaton phenomenology depends strongly on its equation of state after the inflationary phase, which in turn is conditioned by the nature of the potential $V(\phi)$. Depending upon the initial mass and population of PBHs, a large range of DM mass is shown to be viable if reheating is controlled by PBHs itself. Inflaton-dominated reheating is observed to further widen such possibilities depending on the initial population of black holes and its mass as well as the coupling of the inflaton to the standard model sector.</description>

      <title>Improved model of large-field inflation with primordial black hole production in Starobinsky-like supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A viable model of large-field (chaotic) inflation with efficient production of primordial black holes is proposed in Starobinsky-like (modified) supergravity leading to the "no-scale-type" K\"ahler potential and the Wess-Zumino-type ("renormalizable") superpotential. The cosmological tilts are in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations has a large peak at smaller scales, which leads to a production of primordial black holes from gravitational collapse of large perturbations with the masses about $10^{17}$ g. The masses are beyond the Hawking (black hole) evaporation limit of $10^{15}$ g, so that those primordial black holes may be viewed as viable candidates for part or the whole of the current dark matter. The parameters of the superpotential were fine-tuned for those purposes, while the cubic term in the superpotential is essential whereas the quadratic term should vanish. The vacuum after inflation (relevant to reheating) is Minkowskian. The energy density fraction of the gravitational waves induced by the production of primordial black holes and their frequency were also calculated in the second order with respect to perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to explore the possibility that cold dark matter (CDM) and early dark energy (EDE) can be described by canonical scalar fields that are coupled at the level of its conservation equations. The formalism covers dynamical aspects at the background and linear perturbation levels for an arbitrary coupling function, followed by an example of it. We emphasize the impact of this model on the Matter Power Spectrum and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra, with or without direct interaction. Our findings indicate that the presence of a scalar field can partially counteract the known effects of the other, opening the possibility to avoid some undesired aspects, such as the increase in $\Omega_{m}$ that usually is needed in the case of a purely EDE scalar field scenario, in order to fit the CMB spectra. This opens up the possibility to analyzing whether the interaction can help to ameliorate the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>The Ages of the Oldest Astrophysical Objects in an Ellipsoidal Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) observations since its launch have shown us that there could be very massive and very large galaxies, as well as massive quasars very early in the history of the universe, conflicting expectations of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This so-called ''impossibly early galaxy problem'' requires too rapid star formation in the earliest galaxies than appears to be permitted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. In fact, this might not be a high masses problem, but a ''time-compression problem'': time too short for the observed large and massive structures to form from the initial seeds. A cosmological model that could allocate more time for the earliest large structures to form would be more conforming to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work we are going to discuss how the recently proposed $\gamma\delta$CDM model might ease and perhaps resolve the time-compression problem. In the $\gamma\delta$CDM model, different energy densities contribute to the Hubble parameter with different weights. Additionally, in the formula for the Hubble parameter, energy densities depend on the redshift differently than what their physical nature dictates. This new way of relating universe's energy content to the Hubble parameter leads to a modified relation between cosmic time and redshift. We test the observational relevance of the $\gamma\delta$CDM model to the age problem by constraining its parameters with the ages of the oldest astronomical objects (OAO) together with the cosmic chronometers (CC) Hubble data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data of the late universe at low redshift. We find that, thanks to a modified time-redshift relation, the $\gamma\delta$CDM model has a more plausible time period at high redshift for large and massive galaxies and massive quasars to form, whereas the age of the universe today is not modified significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that equality in the Minkowski inequality for asymptotically flat static manifolds is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space. To show this, we establish uniqueness of *quasi-spherical* static metrics: rotationally symmetric regions of Schwarzschild are the only static vacuum metrics which are quasi-spherical with vanishing shear vector. In addition, we observe that the static Minkowski inequality extends to all dimensions for a connected boundary and to asymptotically flat static manifolds of any positive decay order. Altogether, this yields a robust rigidity criterion for Schwarzschild space.
  Using this criterion, we recover Israel's static black hole uniqueness theorem under this mild decay assumption. Likewise, the uniqueness theorems for photon surfaces and static metric extensions from the prequel extend to all dimensions under these weaker asymptotics. Finally, as a notable by-product of our analysis, we establish regularity of weak inverse mean curvature flow in asymptotically flat manifolds -- that is, a weak IMCF is eventually smooth in an arbitrary asymptotically flat background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Spinning binary dynamics in cubic effective field theories of gravity</title>

Abstract: We study the binary dynamics of two Kerr black holes with arbitrary spin vectors in the presence of parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of gravity. We first derive the tree-level Compton amplitudes for a Kerr black hole in cubic gravity, which we then use to compute the two-to-two amplitudes of the massive bodies to leading order in the deformation and the post-Minkowskian expansion. The required one-loop computations are performed using the leading singularity approach as well as the heavy-mass effective field theory (HEFT) approach. These amplitudes are then used to compute the leading-order momentum and spin kick in cubic gravity in the KMOC formalism. Our results are valid for generic masses and spin vectors, and include all the independent parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. We also present spin-expanded expressions for the momentum and spin kicks, and the all-order in spin deflection angle in the case of aligned spins.</description>

      <title>The quasilocal energy and thermodynamic first law in accelerating AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the conserved energy of an accelerating AdS black hole by employing the off-shell quasilocal formalism, which amalgamates the ADT formalism with the covariant phase space approach. In the presence of conical singularities in the accelerating black hole, the energy expression is articulated through the surface term derived from our formalism. The essence of our analysis of the quasilocal energy resides in the surface contributions coming from the conical singularities as well as the conventional radial boundary. Consequently, the resultant conserved quasilocal energy naturally conforms the thermodynamic first law for the black hole without necessitating any augmentation of thermodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation in Gravitationally-Unstable Collapsar Disks and Sub-Solar Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although stable neutron stars (NS) can in principle exist down to masses Mns ~ 0.1Msun, standard models of stellar core-collapse predict a robust lower limit Mns &gt;~ 1.2Msun, roughly commensurate with the Chandrasekhar mass Mch of the progenitor's iron core (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.5). However, this limit may be circumvented in sufficiently dense neutron-rich environments (Ye &lt;&lt; 0.5) for which Mch ~ Ye^2 is reduced to &lt; Msun. Such physical conditions could arise in the black hole accretion disks formed from the collapse of rapidly-rotating stars ("collapsars"), as a result of gravitational instabilities and cooling-induced fragmentation, similar to models for planet formation in protostellar disks. We confirm that the conditions to form sub-solar mass NS (ssNS) may be marginally satisfied in the outer regions of massive neutrino-cooled collapsar disks. If the disk fragments into multiple ssNS, their subsequent coalescence offers a channel for precipitating sub-solar mass LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave mergers that does not implicate primordial black holes. The model makes several additional predictions: (1) ~Hz frequency Doppler modulation of the ssNS-merger gravitational wave signals due to the binary's orbital motion in the disk; (2) at least one additional gravitational wave event (coincident within &lt;~ hours), from the coalescence of the ssNS-merger remnant(s) with the central black hole; (3) an associated gamma-ray burst and supernova counterpart, the latter boosted in energy and enriched with r-process elements from the NS merger(s) embedded within the exploding stellar envelope ("kilonovae inside a supernova").</description>
