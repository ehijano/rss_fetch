      <title>First $D^0+\overline{D}^0$ measurement in heavy-ion collisions at SPS energies with NA61/SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of open charm meson production provides a tool for the investigation of the properties of the hot and dense matter created in nucleus-nucleus collisions at relativistic energies. In particular, charm mesons are of vivid interest in the context of the study of the nature of the phase-transition between confined hadronic matter and the quark-gluon plasma. Recently, the experimental setup of the NA61/SHINE experiment was upgraded with the high spatial resolution Vertex Detector which enables the reconstruction of secondary vertices from open charm meson decays.
  In this presentation the first $D^0$ meson yields at the SPS energy regime will be shown. The analysis used the most central 20\% of Xe+La collisions at 150A GeV/c from the data set collected in 2017. This allowed the estimation of the corrected yields (dN/dy) for $D^0+\overline{D}^0$ via its $\pi^{+/-} + K^{-/+}$ decay channel at mid-rapidity in the center-of-mass system. The results will be compared and discussed in the context of several model calculations including statistical and dynamical approaches</description>

      <title>Is $^{102}$Sb particle-bound or a proton emitter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-proton emission from the $^{102}$Sb nucleus is discussed, assuming an inert $^{100}$Sn core and the valence proton and neutron. There are experimentally measured bound states in the $^{100}$Sn-neutron system, whereas no particle-bound $^{100}$Sn-proton state has been observed. With time-dependent three-body calculations, the $1^+$ ground state of $^{102}$Sb is suggested as a possible proton emitter. This conclusion is reached by assuming a weakening effect on the proton-neutron ($pn$) interaction with respect to a bare deuteron. An analogous phenomenon is necessary to reproduce the empirical binding energies of $^{42}$Sc and $^{18}$F. Continuous shift from the unbound to bound regions by changing the $pn$-interaction strength is demonstrated. The lower limit of lifetime is evaluated as $\tau \gtrsim 4.4 \times 10^{-18}$ seconds in the no-$pn$-interaction limit. However, the actual lifetime is expected as longer with a finite $pn$ interaction. Observation of a resonant state in $^{102}$Sb and its decay would provide a benchmark of the $pn$-pairing correlation.</description>

      <title>A two-body femtoscopy approach to the proton-deuteron correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-deuteron correlation function measured by the ALICE collaboration in high multiplicity p+p collisions shows a momentum dependence which is in contradiction with the predictions of the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism of the two-body interaction. This result motivated a more sophisticated three-body description in terms of a composed deuteron. Encouraged by the good description of other deuteron observables in the context of heavy-ion collisions we revisit this correlation function under the two-body approximation not relying on the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation, but using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation incorporating both strong and Coulomb interactions. The two-body description provides a reasonable agreement to ALICE data for natural values of the source size. Interpreting the previously assumed attractive character of the $(L,S)=(0,3/2)$ channel of the $pd$ interaction into a more-likely repulsion, the results agree better not only with the ALICE measurements but also with recent STAR data in Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal asymmetries in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in UPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of highly charged ions are investigated. The modulations in the azimuthal angles of the sum and difference of the transverse momenta of the pair of particles in the final state, as well as of the transverse impact parameter, arise from the collisions of unpolarized and polarized photons. A full description of the cross section in terms of Generalized Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) for photons is given including a careful consideration of the Fourier transform to impact parameter space. In particular, this leads to a feed-in mechanism among harmonics of different orders, which in principle generates harmonics of all (even) orders. Wherever comparable, our analytical results for the azimuthal modulations agree with those presented in other papers on this topic. Compared to these other works, we separate effects that arise from the anisotropies of the GTMDs from those that do not and retain terms proportional to the mass of the produced particles, as they are relevant for muon, charm and bottom quark production. We show that the normalized differential cross section changes considerably with the produced particle mass, which should be discernible in UPCs at RHIC and LHC. For the numerical results we adopt several models for the photon GTMD correlator, and find that all of them are in fairly good agreement with each other and with UPC data from STAR. We also present results for various azimuthal modulations for RHIC kinematics and compare $e^+ e^-$ production with the production of heavier particles. These results exhibit interesting mass-dependent features in the asymmetries that may help study the anisotropies arising from the underlying photon GTMD description.</description>

      <title>Constraining the p{\Lambda} interaction from a combined analysis of scattering data and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides the first combined analysis of low-energy p$\Lambda$ scattering, considering both cross section and correlation data. The obtained results establish the most stringent constraints to date on the two-body p$\Lambda$ interaction, pointing to a weaker attraction than so far accepted. The best set of scattering lengths for the spin singlet and triplet are found to range from $f_0, f_1 = (2.1, 1.56)$ to $(3.34, 1.18)~$fm. With a chiral NY potential fine-tuned to those scattering parameters, the in-medium properties of the $\Lambda$ are explored and a potential depth of $U_\Lambda= -36.3\pm 1.3 \mathrm{(stat)}^{+2.5}_{-6.2}\mathrm{(syst)}$ MeV is found at nuclear matter saturation density.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background contributing sources, and thus is not a clean measure of the CME.</description>

      <title>Exposing the parton-hadron transition within jets with energy-energy correlators in pp collisions at $\sqrt{\textit s}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully-corrected measurement of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) within jets in pp collisions. The EEC traces the energy flow as a highly energetic parton undergoes a QCD shower followed by the confinement of partons into hadrons, probing the correlation function of the energy flow inside jets. The EEC observable is measured as a function of the charged particle pair angular distance, $R_{\rm L}$, for $20 &lt; p_{\rm T}^{\rm ch \, jet} &lt; 80$ GeV/$c$. In the perturbative region (large $R_{\rm L}$), a good agreement between the data and a next-to-leading-log perturbative QCD calculation is observed. In the non-perturbative region (small $R_{\rm L}$), the data exhibits a linear $R_{\rm L}$ dependence. There is a transition region in between, characterized by a turnover in the EEC distribution, corresponding to the confinement process. The peak of this transition region is located at $2.39 \pm 0.17$ GeV/$c/\langle p_{\rm T}^{\rm ch \, jet}\rangle$ for jets of various energies, indicating a common energy scale for the hadronization process. State-of-the-art Monte Carlo event generators are compared with the measurements, and can be used to constrain the parton shower and hadronization mechanisms.</description>
