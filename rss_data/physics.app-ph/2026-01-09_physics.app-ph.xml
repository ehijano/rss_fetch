      <title>Reversible vertical positioning of acoustically levitated particle using a spiral reflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic positioning in acoustic levitation typically depends on active control of the transducers phases, which necessitates complex driving electronics. While mechanically actuated reflectors offer a simpler alternative, achieving reversible transport along the vertical axis solely through mechanical actuation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate vertical particle translation using a rotating spiral reflector with a half-wavelength pitch. With the rotation axis laterally offset relative to the acoustic focus, the spiral surface functions as a series of translating slopes. Experimental and numerical results confirm stable, bidirectional transport, yielding a vertical displacement of approximately $0.58\lambda$ per revolution and a maximum height of $3.18\lambda$, with radial confinement maintained within $0.24\lambda$. This approach provides a cost-effective solution for non-contact sample handling without active phase control.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Power Division Strategy for Nonlinear Components in Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel adaptive power division strategy, which uses two rectifying diodes with nonlinear impedance characteristics that are configured in parallel to function optimally at their individual power levels. Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly. This conductance-based power allocation method ensures that the power is rectified consistently by the most appropriate diode, regardless of the power level, and, thus, enables efficient rectification across an extended range. This letter presents a rectifier typology to substantiate the proposed strategy. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the adaptive power division strategy, with the rectifier showing efficiency in excess of 60% from 5 to 29.5 dBm, giving a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB.</description>

      <title>Ultra-shallow EUV and soft X-ray gratings fabricated by broad-beam nitrogen ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled and precise fabrication of structures with heights in the range of single digit nanometres is one of the challenges for diffraction gratings operating near-normal incidence in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray range. Here, we expand on previous research utilizing swelling of silicon after irradiation with ions as alternative to conventional dry etching. By irradiating silicon through a mask with a broad beam of nitrogen ions, we realized lamellar gratings in a precise and well controlled process. We were able to fabricate gratings with structure heights between (1.00 +/- 0.05) nm to (10.0 +/- 0.5) nm and a pitch of 1 micrometre, which is suitable for both EUV and soft X-ray applications. A variation of ion energy from 20 keV to 40 keV further expands the foundations of this process and yielded an additional parameter to control the resulting structure height and shape.</description>

      <title>Biomechanically Informed Image Registration for Patient-Specific Aortic Valve Strain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aortic valve (AV) biomechanics play a critical role in maintaining normal cardiac function. Pathological variations, particularly in bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs), alter leaflet loading, increase strain, and accelerate disease progression. Accurate, patient-specific characterization of valve geometry and deformation is essential for predicting disease progression and guiding durable repair. Current imaging and computational methods often fail to capture rapid valve motion and complex patient-specific features. To address these challenges, we combined image registration with finite element method (FEM) to enhance AV tracking and biomechanical assessment. Patient-specific valve geometries from 4D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and CT were used in FEM to model AV closure and generate intermediate deformation states. The FEM-generated states facilitated leaflet tracking, while the registration algorithm corrected mismatches between simulation and image. Across 20 patients, FEM-augmented registration improved accuracy by 40% compared with direct registration (33% for TEE, 46% for CT). This improvement enabled more reliable strain estimation directly from imaging and reducing uncertainties from boundary conditions and material assumptions. Areal and Green-Lagrange strains, as well as effective strain, were quantified in adult trileaflet/bicuspid, and pediatric patients. Trileaflet adults showed uniform deformation, BAVs exhibited asymmetric strain, and pediatric valves had low mean areal strain with high variability. Convergence between trileaflet adult and pediatric valves in mean effective strain suggests volumetric deformation drives age- and size-related differences. The FEM-augmented registration framework enhances geometric tracking and provides clinically relevant insights into patient-specific AV deformation, supporting individualized intervention planning.</description>

      <title>Photonic Temporal Illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with unusual optical properties are central to advanced control of light. Yet, in nature, such materials may be exceedingly rare and often difficult to obtain. To overcome this limitation, here we introduce the concept of temporal illusion: A temporally dynamic framework in which carefully programmed temporal variations in effective parameters generate responses akin to those of, in principle, any arbitrary time-invariant structure. We theoretically demonstrate that proper modulation of the permittivity of a conventional dielectric in space and time replicates the optical behavior associated with exotic materials. Besides, we reveal that, beyond steady-state effects, temporal illusion also enables control over transient responses, for instance, by effectively lowering the time constant of high-quality-factor resonators, therefore, allowing faster energy accumulation. Moreover, by incorporating detuning between modulation and excitation, we show that the framework unlocks additional functionalities. The temporal illusion paradigm thus broadens the capabilities of space-time varying systems, offering a powerful route to synthesize material responses on demand and paving the way for new theoretical and experimental directions in optics and wave physics.</description>

      <title>Local Multimodal Dynamics in Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors and Their Fingerprints in Organic Electrochemical Transistor Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors host tightly coupled interactions among mobile ions, electronic charges, and the polymer matrix, giving rise to complex multimodal responses spanning electrical, mechanical, and morphological transformations. These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights. Our work provides a new framework for probing and understanding mixed conduction in ion-electron coupled systems.</description>
