      <title>The separation modulus of unitarily invariant matrix norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $X=(M_n(\mathbb{R}),\|\cdot\|)$ is a unitarily invariant normed space on , then we prove (via exact computations for a Jacobi orthogonal random matrix ensemble) that the spectral gap of the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit ball $B_X$ of $X$ satisfies $\lambda(X)\asymp n^3 \|I\|^2$. This leads to a confirmation of the weak isomorphic reverse isoperimetry conjecture for $X$, namely, we demonstrate that there exists a convex body $L=L_X\subset B_X$ such that $\mathrm{vol}_{n^2}(L)^{1/n^2}\asymp \mathrm{vol}_{n^2}(B_{X})^{1/n^2}$, yet its isoperimetric quotient is at most a universal constant multiple of $n$. As a corollary (and motivation) of these results, we deduce that the separation modulus of $X$ satisfies $\mathsf{SEP}(X)\asymp \sqrt{n}\|I_n\|_X\mathrm{diam}(B_X)$, where $\mathrm{diam}(B_X)$ is the diameter of $B_X$ with respect to the standard Euclidean metric on $M_n(\mathbb{R})$. Assuming oracle access to norm evaluations in $X$, by combining this with a new deterministic algorithm for efficiently computing a $O(1)$-approximation of the diameter of convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are given by a weak membership oracle and are symmetric with respect to coordinate permutations and reflections about the axes, we obtain an oracle polynomial time algorithm whose output is guaranteed to be the separation modulus of $X$ up to positive universal constant factors. We also deduce an upper bound on the Lipschitz extension modulus of $X$ that improves over the previously best-known bound even in the special case when $X$ is $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ equipped with the $\ell_{2}^n\to \ell_{2}^n$ operator norm.</description>

      <title>Strict concavity properties of cross covariograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the cross covariogram of two convex bodies in n dimensions is 1/n-concave on its support. This paper provides conditions for strict 1/n-concavity in dimension n&gt;1, and an analysis of how it can fail. Among the implications are that (i.) the cross covariogram of strictly convex bodies is strictly 1/n-concave, unless one body contains a translate of the other in its interior, and (ii.) the cross covariogram of an arbitrary convex body with its reflection through the origin is strictly log-concave.</description>

      <title>The canonical form, scissors congruence and adjoint degrees of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the canonical form $\Omega$ as a valuation in the context of scissors congruence for polytopes. We identify the degree of its numerator - the adjoint polynomial $\operatorname{adj}_P$ - as an important invariant in this context. More precisely, for a polytope $P$ we define the degree drop that measures how much smaller than expected the degree of the adjoint polynomial of $P$ is. We show that this drop behaves well under various operations, such as decompositions, restrictions to faces, projections, products and Minkowski sums. Next we define the reduced canonical form $\Omega_0$ and show that it is a translation-invariant 1-homogeneous valuation on polytopes that vanishes if and only if $P$ has positive degree drop. Using it we can prove that zonotopes can be characterized as the $d$-polytopes that have maximal possible degree drop $d-1$. We obtain a decomposition formula for $\Omega_0$ that expresses it as a sum of edge-local quantities of $P$. Finally, we discuss valuations $\Omega_s$ that can distinguish higher values of the degree drop.</description>

      <title>Coarse and pointwise tangent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alberti, Cs\"ornyei and Preiss introduced a notion of a "pointwise (weak) tangent field" for a subset of Euclidean space -- a field that contains almost every tangent line of every curve passing through the set -- and showed that all area-zero sets in the plane admit one-dimensional tangent fields. We extend their results in two distinct directions. First, a special case of our pointwise result shows that each doubling subset of Hilbert space admits a pointwise tangent field in this sense, with dimension bounded by the Nagata (or Assouad) dimension of the set.
  Second, inspired by the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem of Jones, we introduce new, "coarse" notions of tangent field for subsets of Hilbert space, which take into account both large and small scale structure. We show that doubling subsets of Hilbert space admit such coarse tangent fields, again with dimension bounded by the Nagata (or Assouad) dimension of the set. For porous sets in the plane, this result can be viewed as a quantitative version of the Alberti--Cs\"ornyei--Preiss result, though our results hold in all (even infinite) dimensions.</description>

      <title>Symplectically self-polar polytopes of minimal capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of symplectically self-polar convex bodies started in arXiv:2211.14630. We construct symplectically self-polar convex bodies of the minimal Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity. This in turn proves that the lower bound for the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity for centrally symmetric convex bodies obtained in arXiv:1801.00242 cannot be improved. We also make some numerical experiments and speculations regarding the minimal volume of symplectically self-polar convex bodies.</description>

      <title>A coarse geometric approach to graph layout problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a range of new coarse geometric invariants based on various graph-theoretic measures of complexity for finite graphs, including: treewidth, pathwidth, cutwidth and bandwidth. We prove that, for bounded degree graphs, these invariants can be used to define functions which satisfy a strong monotonicity property, namely they are monotonically non-decreasing with respect to a large-scale geometric generalisation of graph inclusion, and as such have potential applications in coarse geometry and geometric group theory. On the graph-theoretic side, we prove asymptotically optimal bounds on most of the above widths for the family of all finite subgraphs of any bounded degree graph whose separation profile is known to be of the form $r^a\log(r)^b$ for some $a&gt;0$. This large class includes Diestel-Leader graphs, all Cayley graphs of non-virtually cyclic polycyclic groups, uniform lattices in almost all connected unimodular Lie groups, and many hyperbolic groups.</description>

Abstract: A {\it paper torus\/} is an embedded polyhedral torus that is isometric to a flat torus in the intrinsic sense.
  We prove that there
  does not exist a paper torus with $7$ vertices,
  and that there does exist a paper torus with $8$ vertices.
  This settles the question of the minimum number of
  vertices needed for a paper torus.</description>

      <title>Trigonometry of partially truncated triangles and tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first main results of this note establish forms of the hyperbolic laws of cosines and sines for certain classes of quadrilaterals and pentagons in the hyperbolic plane, having at least one ideal vertex and right angles at non-ideal vertices, in which the length of a horocyclic cross-section at an ideal vertex plays the role filled by the dihedral angle in the usual versions of these laws. The second set of main results concern transversal length, meaning the distance from a designated internal edge to its opposite, of partially truncated tetrahedra in three-dimensional hyperbolic space whose non-truncated vertices are ideal. Transversal lengths of such tetrahedra are proved to depend only on the entire collection of internal edge lengths (interpreted at ideal vertices in terms of horospherical cross-sections), and bounds on these lengths are established. The case of ideal tetrahedra (no truncated vertices) is also considered. All main results are established using the unifying perspective of the hyperboloid model and Lorentzian geometry. A thorough introduction to this perspective is provided, with references as appropriate.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of symmetrized AMV operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetrized Asymptotic Mean Value Laplacian $\tilde{\Delta}$, obtained as limit of approximating operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$, is an extension of the classical Euclidean Laplace operator to the realm of metric measure spaces. We show that, as $r \downarrow 0$, the operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ eventually admit isolated eigenvalues defined via min-max procedure on any compact locally Ahlfors regular metric measure space. Then we prove $L^2$ and spectral convergence of $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ to the Laplace--Beltrami operator of a compact Riemannian manifold, imposing Neumann conditions when the manifold has a non-empty boundary.</description>
