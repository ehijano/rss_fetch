      <title>Flow-augmentation III: Complexity dichotomy for Boolean CSPs parameterized by the number of unsatisfied constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the parameterized problem of satisfying ``almost all'' constraints of a given formula $F$ over a fixed, finite Boolean constraint language $\Gamma$, with or without weights. More precisely, for each finite Boolean constraint language $\Gamma$, we consider the following two problems. In Min SAT$(\Gamma)$, the input is a formula $F$ over $\Gamma$ and an integer $k$, and the task is to find an assignment $\alpha \colon V(F) \to \{0,1\}$ that satisfies all but at most $k$ constraints of $F$, or determine that no such assignment exists. In Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma$), the input additionally contains a weight function $w \colon F \to \mathbb{Z}_+$ and an integer $W$, and the task is to find an assignment $\alpha$ such that (1) $\alpha$ satisfies all but at most $k$ constraints of $F$, and (2) the total weight of the violated constraints is at most $W$. We give a complete dichotomy for the fixed-parameter tractability of these problems: We show that for every Boolean constraint language $\Gamma$, either Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is FPT; or Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard but Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is FPT; or Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard. This generalizes recent work of Kim et al. (SODA 2021) which did not consider weighted problems, and only considered languages $\Gamma$ that cannot express implications $(u \to v)$ (as is used to, e.g., model digraph cut problems). Our result generalizes and subsumes multiple previous results, including the FPT algorithms for Weighted Almost 2-SAT, weighted and unweighted $\ell$-Chain SAT, and Coupled Min-Cut, as well as weighted and directed versions of the latter. The main tool used in our algorithms is the recently developed method of directed flow-augmentation (Kim et al., STOC 2022).</description>

      <title>Rank Bounds and PIT for $\Sigma^3 \Pi \Sigma \Pi^d$ circuits via a non-linear Edelstein-Kelly theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a non-linear Edelstein-Kelly theorem for polynomials of constant degree, fully settling a stronger form of Conjecture 30 in Gupta (2014), and generalizing the main result of Peleg and Shpilka (STOC 2021) from quadratic polynomials to polynomials of any constant degree.
  As a consequence of our result, we obtain constant rank bounds for depth-4 circuits with top fanin 3 and constant bottom fanin (denoted $\Sigma^{3}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{d}$ circuits) which compute the zero polynomial. This settles a stronger form of Conjecture 1 in Gupta (2014) when $k=3$, for any constant degree bound; additionally this also makes progress on Conjecture 28 in Beecken, Mittmann, and Saxena (Information \&amp; Computation, 2013). Our rank bounds, when combined with Theorem 2 in Beecken, Mittmann, and Saxena (Information \&amp; Computation, 2013) yield the first deterministic, polynomial time PIT algorithm for $\Sigma^{3}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{d}$ circuits.</description>
