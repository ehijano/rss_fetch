      <title>Graph-based Scalable Sampling of 3D Point Cloud Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Point clouds (PCs) are commonly used to represent 3D scenes. They can have millions of points, making subsequent downstream tasks such as compression and streaming computationally expensive. PC sampling (selecting a subset of points) can be used to reduce complexity. Existing PC sampling algorithms focus on preserving geometry features and often do not scale to handle large PCs. In this work, we develop scalable graph-based sampling algorithms for PC color attributes, assuming the full geometry is available. Our sampling algorithms are optimized for a signal reconstruction method that minimizes the graph Laplacian quadratic form. We first develop a global sampling algorithm that can be applied to PCs with millions of points by exploiting sparsity and sampling rate adaptive parameter selection. Further, we propose a block-based sampling strategy where each block is sampled independently. We show that sampling the corresponding sub-graphs with optimally chosen self-loop weights (node weights) will produce a sampling set that approximates the results of global sampling while reducing complexity by an order of magnitude. Our empirical results on two large PC datasets show that our algorithms outperform the existing fast PC subsampling techniques (uniform and geometry feature preserving random sampling) by 2dB. Our algorithm is up to 50 times faster than existing graph signal sampling algorithms while providing better reconstruction accuracy. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of PC attribute sampling within a compression scenario, showing that pre-compression sampling of PC attributes can lower the bitrate by 11% while having minimal effect on reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Latent Diffusion Model for Training-Free Image Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown the ability to generate high-quality images. However, controlling its generation process still poses challenges. The image style transfer task is one of those challenges that transfers the visual attributes of a style image to another content image. Typical obstacle of this task is the requirement of additional training of a pre-trained model. We propose a training-free style transfer algorithm, Style Tracking Reverse Diffusion Process (STRDP) for a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Our algorithm employs Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) function in a distinct manner during the reverse diffusion process of an LDM while tracking the encoding history of the style image. This algorithm enables style transfer in the latent space of LDM for reduced computational cost, and provides compatibility for various LDM models. Through a series of experiments and a user study, we show that our method can quickly transfer the style of an image without additional training. The speed, compatibility, and training-free aspect of our algorithm facilitates agile experiments with combinations of styles and LDMs for extensive application.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Parameter Potential of Neural Representation for Efficient Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades, video compression technology has been a prominent research area. Traditional hybrid video compression framework and end-to-end frameworks continue to explore various intra- and inter-frame reference and prediction strategies based on discrete transforms and deep learning techniques. However, the emerging implicit neural representation (INR) technique models entire videos as basic units, automatically capturing intra-frame and inter-frame correlations and obtaining promising performance. INR uses a compact neural network to store video information in network parameters, effectively eliminating spatial and temporal redundancy in the original video. However, in this paper, our exploration and verification reveal that current INR video compression methods do not fully exploit their potential to preserve information. We investigate the potential of enhancing network parameter storage through parameter reuse. By deepening the network, we designed a feasible INR parameter reuse scheme to further improve compression performance. Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly enhances the rate-distortion performance of INR video compression.</description>

      <title>RADAR: Robust Two-stage Modality-incomplete Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection (MIAD), utilizing 3D point clouds and 2D RGB images to identify the abnormal region of products, plays a crucial role in industrial quality inspection. However, the conventional MIAD setting presupposes that all 2D and 3D modalities are paired, overlooking the fact that multimodal data collected from the real world is often imperfect due to missing modalities. Consequently, MIAD models that demonstrate robustness against modal-incomplete data are highly desirable in practice. To address this practical challenge, we introduce a first-of-its-kind study that comprehensively investigates Modality-Incomplete Industrial Anomaly Detection (MIIAD), to consider the imperfect learning environment in which the multimodal information may be incomplete. Not surprisingly, we discovered that most existing MIAD approaches are inadequate for addressing MIIAD challenges, leading to significant performance degradation on the MIIAD benchmark we developed. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage Robust modAlity-imcomplete fusing and Detecting frAmewoRk, abbreviated as RADAR. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to enhance two stages in MIIAD, improving the robustness of the Multimodal Transformer: i) In feature fusion, we first explore learning modality-incomplete instruction, guiding the pre-trained Multimodal Transformer to robustly adapt to various modality-incomplete scenarios, and implement adaptive parameter learning based on a HyperNetwork; ii) In anomaly detection, we construct a real-pseudo hybrid module to highlight the distinctiveness of modality combinations, further enhancing the robustness of the MIIAD model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RADAR significantly surpasses conventional MIAD methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness on our newly created MIIAD dataset, underscoring its practical application value.</description>

      <title>DiffSSD: A Diffusion-Based Dataset For Speech Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech generators are ubiquitous. These methods can generate very high quality synthetic speech and several recent incidents report their malicious use. To counter such misuse, synthetic speech detectors have been developed. Many of these detectors are trained on datasets which do not include diffusion-based synthesizers. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing detectors trained on one such dataset, ASVspoof2019, do not perform well in detecting synthetic speech from recent diffusion-based synthesizers. We propose the Diffusion-Based Synthetic Speech Dataset (DiffSSD), a dataset consisting of about 200 hours of labeled speech, including synthetic speech generated by 8 diffusion-based open-source and 2 commercial generators. We also examine the performance of existing synthetic speech detectors on DiffSSD in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. The results highlight the importance of this dataset in detecting synthetic speech generated from recent open-source and commercial speech generators.</description>

      <title>Spatial Visibility and Temporal Dynamics: Revolutionizing Field of View Prediction in Adaptive Point Cloud Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-of-View (FoV) adaptive streaming significantly reduces bandwidth requirement of immersive point cloud video (PCV) by only transmitting visible points in a viewer's FoV. The traditional approaches often focus on trajectory-based 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) FoV predictions. The predicted FoV is then used to calculate point visibility. Such approaches do not explicitly consider video content's impact on viewer attention, and the conversion from FoV to point visibility is often error-prone and time-consuming. We reformulate the PCV FoV prediction problem from the cell visibility perspective, allowing for precise decision-making regarding the transmission of 3D data at the cell level based on the predicted visibility distribution. We develop a novel spatial visibility and object-aware graph model that leverages the historical 3D visibility data and incorporates spatial perception, neighboring cell correlation, and occlusion information to predict the cell visibility in the future. Our model significantly improves the long-term cell visibility prediction, reducing the prediction MSE loss by up to 50% compared to the state-of-the-art models while maintaining real-time performance (more than 30fps) for point cloud videos with over 1 million points.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Audio: Advancing Multi-Audio Processing in Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various audio-LLMs (ALLMs) have been explored recently for tackling different audio tasks simultaneously using a single, unified model. While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human annotations. The proposed MALLM opens the door for ALLMs towards multi-audio processing era and brings us closer to replicating human auditory capabilities in machines.</description>
