      <title>Rotating Quantum Droplets in Low Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum droplets formed by rubidium, lithium, and sodium atoms have been analyzed in this paper by using a logarithmic-type Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Variational methods and numerical techniques were employed to solve the corresponding nonlinear equations. A disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate was analyzed to assess its radial evolution. Additionally, free expansion under rotation of the BEC was studied. Compression and expansion around the equilibrium radius were observed in different scenarios, predicting self-confinement, which implies the formation of quantum droplets originating from a BEC state. Briefly, the physical aspects of the system and the possible formation of Bose-nova effects are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

      <title>Observation of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universal scaling in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. Here we propose a previously unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This novel MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. Our results are demonstrated in semimetal WTe$_2$ thin films.</description>

      <title>Collision-assisted information scrambling on a configurable photonic chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interference and entanglement are in the core of quantum computations. The fast spread of information in the quantum circuit helps to mitigate the circuit depth. Although the information scrambling in the closed systems has been proposed and tested in the digital circuits, how to measure the evolution of quantum correlations between systems and environments remains a delicate and open question. Here, we propose a photonic circuit to investigate the information scrambling in an open quantum system by implementing the collision model with cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We numerically simulate the photon propagation and find that the tripartite mutual information strongly depends on the system-environment and environment-environment interactions. We further reduce the number of observables and the number of shots required to reconstruct the density matrix by designing an enhanced compressed sensing. Our results provide a reconfigurable photonic platform for simulating open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring controllable dissipation and non-Markovianity in discrete-variable photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Flat Midgap Topological Surface and Hypersurface Bands without Parameter Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is extended to the three and higher dimensional systems. Nearly or absolutely flat midgap surface and hypersurface bands are predicted based on the topological analysis, which do not require fine tuning of parameters. By adding the on-site Coulomb interaction for the three dimensional systems, we computationally show that the large difference in the band widths between the surface and the bulk leads to the strongly correlated phenomena, specifically magnetism, confined only on the surface. Possible experimental realizations in solid state materials and metamaterials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Effect for 2-D Non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson Model in Cylinder Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge offers a powerful route to engineer novel topological phenomena. Here, we systematically investigate a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model incorporating SU(2) non-Abelian gauge, demonstrating the emergence of Hopf-link bulk braiding topology in the complex energy spectrum solely with x-direction nearest-neighbor couplings. Because of the limitations of exceptional point (EP) topology in fully capturing the rich non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under non-Abelian influence, we introduce a novel polarization parameter derived from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). This parameter quantitatively discerns left-, right-, and notably, bipolar skin modes, with its accuracy corroborated by directly encoding real-space eigenstate. Our findings reveal that non-Abelian gauge provides unprecedented influence over NHSE, compared with Abelian gauge and without gauge cases. Furthermore, we uncover unique characteristics of zero-imaginary-energy eigenstates at these topological boundaries, including pronounced degeneracy and bipolar localization which is unaffected by size effects, investigated via dynamical evolution and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). This work establishes a new paradigm for synthesizing and manipulating non-Hermitian topological phases driven by non-Abelian structures, opening avenues for topological engineering and holding promise for experimental realization in synthetic dimensional platforms.</description>

      <title>Emergent broadband polarization entanglement from electronic and phononic Stokes-anti-Stokes indistinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it has been shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two-photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>
