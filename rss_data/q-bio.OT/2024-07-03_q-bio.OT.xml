      <title>From Cognition to Computation: A Comparative Review of Human Attention and Transformer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention is a cornerstone of human cognition that facilitates the efficient extraction of information in everyday life. Recent developments in artificial intelligence like the Transformer architecture also incorporate the idea of attention in model designs. However, despite the shared fundamental principle of selectively attending to information, human attention and the Transformer model display notable differences, particularly in their capacity constraints, attention pathways, and intentional mechanisms. Our review aims to provide a comparative analysis of these mechanisms from a cognitive-functional perspective, thereby shedding light on several open research questions. The exploration encourages interdisciplinary efforts to derive insights from human attention mechanisms in the pursuit of developing more generalized artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Systematizing Cellular Complexity: A Hilbertian Approach To Biological Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04627v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Examining individual components of cellular systems has been successful in uncovering molecular reactions and interactions. However, the challenge lies in integrating these components into a comprehensive system-scale map. This difficulty arises due to factors such as missing links (unknown variables), overlooked nonlinearities in high-dimensional parameter space, downplayed natural noisiness and stochasticity, and a lack of focus on causal influence and temporal dynamics. Composite static and phenomenological descriptions, while appearing complicated, lack the essence of what makes the biological systems truly "complex".
  The formalization of system-level problems is therefore important in constructing a meta-theory of biology. Addressing fundamental aspects of cellular regulation, adaptability, and noise management is vital for understanding the robustness and functionality of biological systems. These aspects encapsulate the challenges that cells face in maintaining stability, responding to environmental changes, and harnessing noise for functionality. This work examines these key problems that cells must solve, serving as a template for such formalization and as a step towards the axiomatization of biological investigations. Through a detailed exploration of cellular mechanisms, particularly homeostatic configuration, ion channels and harnessing noise, this paper aims to illustrate complex concepts and theories in a tangible context, providing a bridge between abstract theoretical frameworks and concrete biological phenomena.</description>
