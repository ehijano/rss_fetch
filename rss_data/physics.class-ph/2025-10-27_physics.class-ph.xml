      <title>The swinging counterweight trebuchet. On internal friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical energy is lost to friction during a shot with a trebuchet. The losses are mainly due to sliding friction at the bearings for the throwing arm and at the hinge for the swinging counterweight, but the aerodynamic force on the sling also contributes. Generalized forces for these sliding and aerodynamic frictions are derived and included in the equations for the internal movement of the engine. The equations are solved by the use of perturbation theory and calculated losses are compared with results from an experimental engine of small dimensions. Scaling to full-size trebuchets is discussed.</description>

      <title>An extensive search for stable periodic orbits of the equal-mass zero angular momentum three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A special 2D initial conditions' domain of the equal-mass zero angular momentum planar three-body problem, which has been formerly studied, is analyzed to deepen the knowledge of the stability regions in it. The decay times in the domain are carefully computed. Four stability regions are established. 971 verified initial conditions for linearly stable periodic collisionless orbits are found. Many of these identified initial conditions are new ones. The periodic orbits of each stability region are characterized by a certain pattern in their syzygy sequences. Additional computations show that the orbits found should be considered as candidates for KAM-stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Note on Jackson's formalism of gauge transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An outline is given of the derivation of two inhomogeneous wave equations in an influential 2002 AJP paper of Jackson on the transformation from the Lorenz gauge to other electromagnetic gauges. The derivation shows that, contrary to a statement in the paper, the function satisfying one of the equations is not associated with the Coulomb-gauge vector potential but is associated with the Lorenz-gauge vector potential instead.</description>
