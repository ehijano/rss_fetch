      <title>Dynamical System Analysis for Scalar Field Potential in Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have presented a power law cosmological model and its dynamical system analysis in $f(T,\phi)$ gravity, where $T$ is the torsion scalar and $\phi$ is the canonical scalar field. The two well-motivated forms of the non-minimal coupling function $F(\phi)$, the exponential form and the power law form, with exponential potential function, are investigated. The dynamical system analysis is performed by establishing the dimensionless dynamical variables, and the critical points were obtained. The evolution of standard density parameters is analysed for each case. The behaviour of the equation of state (EoS) and deceleration parameter show agreement with the result of cosmological observations. The model parameters are constrained using the existence and the stability conditions of the critical points describing different epochs of the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Non-comoving description of adiabatic radial perturbations of relativistic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study adiabatic, radial perturbations of static, self-gravitating perfect fluids within the theory of general relativity employing a new perturbative formalism. We show that by considering a radially static observer, the description of the perturbations can be greatly simplified with respect to the standard comoving treatment. The new perturbation equations can be solved to derive analytic solutions to the problem for a general class of equilibrium solutions. We discuss the thermodynamic description of the fluid under isotropic frame transformations, showing how, in the radially static, non-inertial frame, the stress-energy tensor of the fluid must contain momentum transfer terms. As illustrative examples of the new approach, we study perturbations of equilibrium spacetimes characterized by the Buchdahl I, Heintzmann IIa, Patwardhan-Vaidya IIa, and Tolman VII solutions, computing the first oscillation eigenfrequencies and the associated eigenfunctions. We also analyze the properties of the perturbations of cold neutron stars composed of a perfect fluid verifying the Bethe-Johnson model I equation of state, computing the oscillation eigenfrequencies and the $e$-folding time.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes captured by neutron stars: simulations in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present self-consistent numerical simulations in general relativity of putative primordial black holes inside neutron stars. Complementing a companion paper in which we assumed the black hole mass $m$ to be much smaller than the mass $M_*$ of the neutron star, thereby justifying a point-mass treatment, we here consider black holes with masses large enough so that their effect on the neutron star cannot be neglected. We develop and employ several new numerical techniques, including initial data describing boosted black holes in neutron-star spacetimes, a relativistic determination of the escape speed, and a gauge condition that keeps the black hole hole at a fixed coordinate location. We then perform numerical simulations that highlight different aspects of the capture of primordial black holes by neutron stars. In particular, we simulate the initial passage of the black hole through the star, demonstrating that the neutron star remains dynamically stable provided the black-hole mass is sufficiently small, $m \lesssim 0.05 M_*$. We also model the late evolution of a black hole oscillating about the center of an initially stable neutron star while accreting stellar mass and ultimately triggering gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH), in turn leading to an expression for its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This allowed as well the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations. The concepts of \textit{extracted} and \textit{extractable} energy soon followed. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show that these processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, including the BH capture of the particle falling into the horizon, the increase of the irreducible mass is much larger than the extracted energy. Correspondingly, the horizon radius increases. The energy extraction process saturates and stops when the horizon reaches the decay radius. Thus, reaching a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state by this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for three selected decay radii, $r= 1.2 M$, $1.5 M$, and $1.9 M$. The energy extracted until saturation is only $2.75\%$, $4.54\%$, and $2.45\%$ of the BH initial mass, while the extractable energy is reduced by $25\%$, $56\%$, and $92\%$. The BH rotational energy is mostly converted into irreducible mass, which increases to $75\%$, $83\%$, and $95\%$ of the initial BH mass. Therefore, evaluating the effect of the irreducible mass increase in the energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is now mandatory.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy with ground-based atom interferometer and space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection has enabled us to test General Relativity in an entirely new regime. A prominent role in tests of General Relativity takes the detection of the Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) that arise as the highly distorted remnant formed after the merger emits GWs until it becomes a regular Kerr BH. According to the no-hair theorem, the frequencies and damping times of these QNMs are determined solely by the mass and spin of the remnant BH. Therefore, detecting the QNMs offers a unique way to probe the nature of the remnant BH and to test General Relativity. We study the detection of a merging binary black hole (BBH) in the intermediate mass range, where the inspiral-merger phase is detected by space-based laser interferometer detectors TianQin and LISA while the ringdown is detected by the ground-based atom interferometer (AI) observatory AION. The analysis of the ringdown is done using the regular broadband mode of AI detectors as well as using the resonant mode where the detection band is optimized to the frequencies of the QNMs predicted from the inspiral-merger phase. We find that using the regular broadband mode allows constraining the parameters of the BBH with relative errors of at most $10^{-6}$ from the ringdown while the frequencies and the damping times of the QNMs can be determined with total errors below $0.2\,{\rm Hz}$ and $115\,{\rm \mu s}$, respectively. Furthermore, we find that using the resonant mode can improve the parameter estimation for the BBH from the ringdown by up to one order of magnitude. Utilizing the resonant mode significantly limits the detection of the frequency of the QNMs but improves the detection error of the damping times by one to four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Observational test of ${\cal R}^{2}$ spacetimes with the S2 star in the Milky Way galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel class of vacuum metrics expressible in analytical form was recently found for pure $\mathcal R^2$ gravity, based on a groundwork put forth by Buchdahl in 1962. These Buchdahl-inspired solutions offer a practical framework for testing ${\cal R}^2$ gravity through empirical observations. Within a subclass of asymptotically flat Buchdahl-inspired vacuum spacetimes, we identified a parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the deviation from the classic Schwarzschild metric, which corresponds to $\epsilon=0$. In this paper, we employ observational data from the S2 star's orbit around Sgr A* in the Milky Way galactic center and perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations to probe the effects of the new metrics on the orbit of S2 star. Our analysis presented herein reports a range at 95\% confidence level on the deviation parameter as $\epsilon\in(-0.4930,\ 0.5001)$. While no decisive evidence either in favor or in disfavor of the asymptotically flat Buchdahl-inspired spacetimes has been achieved, the obtained bound is compatible with the tighter results using other data of different nature as recently reported in Eur.\,Phys.\,J.\,C $\bf 84$, 330 (2024). As a meaningful test probing into a strong-field regime, our present study calls for further observations with prolonged period and improved accuracy in order to tighten the bound for $\epsilon$ using the S2 star orbit.</description>

      <title>Partial Derivatives on Causal Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will discuss two approaches to estimating partial derivatives and the metric components; one utilizing past work describing a causal set $\Box$ operator, and one using a construction from linear algebra called the Moore-Penrose inverse. After running numerical tests on a causal diamond in $\mathbb{M}^2$, we find that the approach using the Moore-Penrose inverse is significantly more accurate. Despite the large variances in the method using the $\Box$ operator, there is reason to believe both approaches should become more accurate at higher densities.</description>

      <title>KG-oscillators in Som-Raychaudhuri rotating cosmic string spacetime in a mixed magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a G\"{o}% del-type Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime in a mixed magnetic field (given by the vector potential $A_{\mu }=\left( 0,0,A_{\varphi },0\right) $, with $% A_{\varphi }=B_{1}r^{2}/2+B_{2}r$). The resulting KG equation takes a Schr% \"{o}dinger-like form (with an oscillator plus a linear plus a Coulomb-like interactions potential) that admits a solution in the form of biconfluent Heun functions/series $H_{B}\left( \alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta ,z\right) $% . The usual power series expansion of which is truncated to a polynomial of \ order $n_{r}+1=n\geq 1$ through the usual condition $\gamma =2\left( n_{r}+1\right) +\alpha $. However, we use the very recent recipe suggested by Mustafa \cite{1.29} as an alternative parametric condition/correlation. i.e., $\delta =-\beta \left( 2n_{r}+\alpha +3\right) $, to facilitate conditional exact solvability of the problem. We discuss and report the effects of the mixed magnetic field as well as the effects of the G\"{o}del-type SR-spacetime background on the KG-oscillators' spectroscopic structure.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cosmic space and horizon thermodynamics in the context of the quantum-deformed entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the quantum deformation approach to quantum gravity, the thermodynamical entropy of a quantum-deformed (q-deformed) black hole with horizon area $A$ established by Jalalzadeh is expressed as $S_q = \pi\sin \left( \frac{A}{8G\mathcal N} \right) /\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2\mathcal N}\right)$, where $\mathcal N=L_q^2/L_{p}^2$ is the q-deformation parameter, $L_{p}$ denotes the Planck length, and $L_q$ denotes the quantum-deformed cosmic apparent horizon distance. In this paper, assuming that the q-deformed entropy is associated with the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, we derive the Friedmann equation from the unified first law of thermodynamics, ${dE = T_q dS_q + WdV}$. And this one obtained is in line with the Friedmann equation derived from the law of emergence proposed by Padmanabhan. It clearly shows the connection between the law of emergence and the unified first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, in the context of the q-deformed horizon entropy, we investigate the constraints of entropy maximization, and result demonstrates the consistency of the law of emergence with the maximization of the q-deformed horizon entropy. Hence, the law of emergence can be understood as a tendency to maximize the q-deformed horizon entropy.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector: a dynamical system perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between the dark sectors from a dynamical systems perspective. A general setup for interacting dark energy models that incorporates both quintessence and phantom fields through a switch parameter, allowing an interaction in the dark sectors has been considered. In the first part of our analysis, we have not assumed any specific form of the interaction and in the second part, we invoked examples in general framework of the interaction. The potentials of the scalar field are classified into two broad classes of potentials: exponential and non-exponential. We identify the potential late-time attractors of the system which have a complete dark energy domination. From our analysis, it is evident there could be an interaction between the dark sector. The interaction, if any, weakens over time. We find for the quintessence field the transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy can flip the direction and on the contrary, for the phantom field, it is only from dark matter to dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model with two real Maxwell fields (or equivalently, a complex Maxwell field) minimally coupled to Einsteins gravity with a negative cosmological constant in four spacetime dimensions. Assuming a specific harmonic dependence of the vector fields, we show the existence of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) self-gravitating boson-star-like solitonic solutions, which are static and axially symmetric. Analytical solutions are found in the test-field limit, where the Maxwell equations are solved on a fixed AdS background. The fully nonlinear solutions are constructed numerically.</description>

Abstract: We present de Sitter Teukolsky waves -- linearised quadrupolar gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge in de Sitter spacetime. In the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ going to zero limit, our solutions match to Teukolsky solutions. For non-zero $\Lambda$, we compare our solutions to the wider literature, where different authors have constructed linearised gravitational perturbations in de Sitter spacetime with varied motivations. For de Sitter Teukolsky waves, we compute the energy flux across future timelike infinity $\mathcal{I}^{+}$ and show that it is manifestly positive.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations with Timelike Scalar Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study static tidal Love numbers (TLNs) of a static and spherically symmetric black hole for odd-parity metric perturbations. We describe black hole perturbations using the effective field theory (EFT), formulated on an arbitrary background with a timelike scalar profile in the context of scalar-tensor theories. In particular, we obtain a static solution for the generalized Regge-Wheeler equation order by order in a modified-gravity parameter and extract the TLNs uniquely by analytic continuation of the multipole index $\ell$ to non-integer values. For a stealth Schwarzschild black hole, the TLNs are vanishing as in the case of Schwarzschild solution in general relativity. We also study the case of Hayward black hole as an example of non-stealth background, where we find that the TLNs are non-zero (or there is a logarithmic running). This result suggests that our EFT allows for non-vanishing TLNs and can in principle leave a detectable imprint on gravitational waves from inspiralling binary systems, which opens a new window for testing gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau meets Gravity: A Calabi-Yau three-fold at fifth post-Minkowskian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11371v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study geometries occurring in Feynman integrals that contribute to the scattering of black holes in the post-Minkowskian expansion. These geometries become relevant to gravitational-wave production during the inspiralling phase of binary black hole mergers through the classical conservative potential. At fourth post-Minkowskian order, a K3 surface is known to occur in a three-loop integral, leading to elliptic integrals in the result. In this letter, we identify a Calabi-Yau three-fold in a four-loop integral, contributing at fifth post-Minkowskian order. The presence of this Calabi-Yau geometry indicates that completely new functions occur in the full analytical results at this order.</description>

      <title>Alleviating $H_0$ and $S_8$ Tensions Simultaneously in K-essence Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05843v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the growth of structure parameter $S_8$ can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, our model can reduce $H_0$ tension to roughly $2.2 \sigma$ and the $S_8$ discrepancy diminishes to $0.82\sigma$.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Limits of Bosonic and Heterotic Double Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The known stringy non-relativistic (NR) limit of the universal NS-NS sector of supergravity has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the metric and the $B$-field. We demonstrate that in Double Field Theory (DFT) and generalised geometry these cancellations already happen at the level of the generalised metric, which is convergent in the limit $c \rightarrow \infty$. On the level of bosonic DFT this implies that the NR limit can be taken before imposing the strong constraint and breaking the duality symmetry. At the (finite) leading order this reproduces the Non-Riemannian formulation of DFT. Assuming a convergent generalised metric for heterotic DFT, we derive a novel $c$-expansion for heterotic supergravity which is, by construction, O$(D,D)$-invariant.</description>

      <title>The fate of boundary terms in dimensional reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at 1-loop in the Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute 1-loop corrections to the bispectrum in the decoupling limit of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFToI). We regulate the divergences by employing dimensional regularization and work in $d=3+\delta$ dimensions. We find that the final results feature analytic structures of the form $\log{\left(k_i/k_T\right)}$ and $\log{\left(H/\mu\right)}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\mu$ is the renormalisation scale. An interesting outcome of our calculations is that unlike the 1-loop correction to the power-spectrum computed in arXiv:0912.2734 the unrenormalised answers always produce unphysical logarithms of co-moving momenta. These unphysical logarithms are cancelled only after renormalisation. We expect this to be a generic feature for loop computations unless there is some cancellation as in the previously computed 1-loop result for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Stealth Bias in LISA observations of Double White Dwarf Binaries due to Tidal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double white dwarfs are important gravitational wave sources for LISA, as they are some of the most numerous compact systems in our universe. Here we consider finite-sized effects due to tidal interactions, as they are expected to have a measurable impact on these systems. Previous studies suggested that tidal effects would allow the individual masses to be measured, but there was a subtle error in those analyses. Using a fully Bayesian analysis we find that while tidal effects do not allow us to constrain the individual masses, they do yield informative lower bounds on the total mass of the system. Including tidal effects is crucial to the accuracy of our estimation of the chirp and total mass. Neglecting tidal effects leads to significant biases towards higher chirp masses, and we see that the lower bound of the total masses is biased towards a higher value as well. For many systems observed by LISA, tidal effects can lead to a "stealth" bias, since only the first derivative of the frequency can be measured. To separate tidal effects from the usual point particle decay we need to be able to measure the change in the second derivative of the frequency cause by the tides. This can only be done for high frequency systems observed with high signal-to-noise. The bias, if not accounted for, can have significant astrophysical implications; for example, it could lead to an incorrect estimation of the population of potential Type IA supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <title>$k$-e$\mu$lator: emulating clustering effects of the $k$-essence dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build an emulator based on the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) technique to efficiently model the non-linear effects associated with the clustering of the $k$-essence dark energy in the effective field theory (EFT) framework. These effects can be described through a modification of Poisson's equation, denoted by the function $\mu(k,z)$, which in general depends on wavenumber $k$ and redshift $z$. To emulate this function, we perform $200$ high-resolution $N$-body simulations sampled from a seven-dimensional parameter space with the Latin hypercube method. These simulations are executed using the $\texttt{k-evolution}$ code on a fixed mesh, containing $1200^3$ dark matter particles within a box size of $400~\text{Mpc}/ h$. The emulation process has been carried out within $\texttt{UQLab}$, a $\texttt{MATLAB}$-based software specifically dedicated to emulation and uncertainty quantification tasks. Apart from its role in emulation, the PCE method also facilitates the measurement of Sobol indices, enabling us to assess the relative impact of each cosmological parameter on the $\mu$ function. Our results show that the PCE-based emulator efficiently and accurately reflects the behavior of the $k$-essence dark energy for the cosmological parameter space defined by $w_0 c_s^2 \text{CDM} +\sum m_{\nu}$. Compared against actual simulations, the emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy up to the wavenumber $k \approx 9.4 ~h \text{Mpc}^{-1} $ for redshifts $z \leq 3$. Our emulator provides an efficient and reliable tool for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, and its capability to closely mimic the properties of the $k$-essence dark energy makes it a crucial component in Bayesian parameter estimations.

      <title>A Relativistic Formula for the Multiple Scattering of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discovered analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of photons that are multiply scattered in relativistic flows, under the assumption of isotropic and inelastic scattering. These expressions characterize the collective dynamics of these photons, ranging from free-streaming to diffusion regions. The PDF, defined within the light cone to ensure the preservation of causality, is expressed in a three-dimensional space at a constant time surface. This expression is achieved by summing the PDFs of photons that have been scattered $n$ times within four-dimensional spacetime. We have confirmed that this formulation accurately reproduces the results of relativistic Monte Carlo simulations.We found that the PDF in three-dimensional space at a constant time surface can be represented in a separable variable form. We demonstrate the behavior of the PDF in the laboratory frame across a wide range of Lorentz factors for the relativistic flow. When the Lorentz factor of the fluid is low, the behavior of scattered photons evolves sequentially from free propagation to diffusion, and then to dynamic diffusion, where the mean effective velocity of the photons equates to that of the fluid. On the other hand, when the Lorentz factor is large, the behavior evolves from anisotropic ballistic motion, characterized by a mean effective velocity approaching the speed of light, to dynamic diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

      <title>Constraining possible $\gamma$-ray burst emission from GW230529 using Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW230529 is the first compact binary coalescence detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration with at least one component mass confidently in the lower mass-gap, corresponding to the range 3-5$M_{\odot}$. If interpreted as a neutron star-black hole merger, this event has the most symmetric mass ratio detected so far and therefore has a relatively high probability of producing electromagnetic (EM) emission. However, no EM counterpart has been reported. At the merger time $t_0$, Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM together covered 100$\%$ of the sky. Performing a targeted search in a time window $[t_0-20 \text{s},t_0+20 \text{s}]$, we report no detection by the Swift-BAT and the Fermi-GBM instruments. Combining the position-dependent $\gamma-$ray flux upper limits and the gravitational-wave posterior distribution of luminosity distance, sky localization and inclination angle of the binary, we derive constraints on the characteristic luminosity and structure of the jet possibly launched during the merger. Assuming a top-hat jet structure, we exclude at 90$\%$ credibility the presence of a jet which has at the same time an on-axis isotropic luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in the bolometric band 1 keV-10 MeV, and a jet opening angle $\gtrsim 15$ deg. Similar constraints are derived testing other assumptions about the jet structure profile. Excluding GRB 170817A, the luminosity upper limits derived here are below the luminosity of any GRB observed so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy behavior of the de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. In the de Sitter spacetime, a cosmological horizon that constrains the causal accessible region of an observer, exhibits thermal properties analogous to the event horizon of a black hole. From the principle of holography, the entropy within the causally connected region for an observer is constrained by the area of its boundary. This entropy bound is violated in the late stage of inflation. To address the issue of entropy bound violation from a perspective of quantum information, we adopt the stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. To reformulate the issue of entropy bound in the inflation, we follow the derivation of the Page curve in the black hole context. By adopting the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we obtain a meaningful entropy behavior in the de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are a common prediction in many grand unified theories and a promising source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$, exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency $f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale $v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1805.07240v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian formalisms provide powerful tools for the computation of approximate analytic solutions of the Einstein field equations. The post-Newtonian computations of the explicit analytic dynamics and motion of compact binaries are discussed within the most often applied Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism. The obtention of autonomous Hamiltonians is achieved by the transition to Routhians. Order reduction of higher derivative Hamiltonians results in standard Hamiltonians. Tetrad representation of general relativity is introduced for the tackling of compact binaries with spinning components. Compact objects are modeled by use of Dirac delta functions and their derivatives. Consistency is achieved through transition to $d$-dimensional space and application of dimensional regularization. At the fourth post-Newtonian level, tail contributions to the binding energy show up for the first time. The conservative dynamics of binary systems finds explicit presentation and discussion through the fifth post-Newtonian order for spinless masses. For masses with spin Hamiltonians are known through (next-to)$^3$-leading-order spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings as well as through next-to-leading order cubic and quartic in spin interactions. Parts of those are given explicitly. Tidal-interaction Hamiltonians are considered through (next-to)$^2$-leading post-Newtonian order. The radiation reaction dynamics is presented explicitly through the third-and-half post-Newtonian order for spinless objects, and, for spinning bodies, to leading-order in the spin-orbit and spin1-spin2 couplings. The most important historical issues get pointed out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a regular rotating black hole evaporating under the Hawking emission of a single scalar field. The black hole is described by the Kerr-black-bounce metric with a nearly extremal regularizing parameter $\ell=0.99r_+$. We compare the results with a Kerr black hole evaporating under the same conditions. Firstly, we compute the gray-body factors and show that the Kerr-black-bounce evolves towards a non-Schwartzchild-like asymptotic state with $a_* \sim 0.47$, differently from a Kerr black hole whose asymptotic spin would be $a_* \sim 0.555$. We show that this result depends on the combined contributions of the differences in the gray-body factors and the surface gravity affected by the regularizing parameter. We also discuss how the surface gravity affects the temperature and the primary emissivity and decreases those quantities with respect to the Kerr black hole. Consequently, the regular black hole has a longer lifetime. Finally, we briefly comment on the possibility of investigating the beyond-the-horizon structure of a black hole exploiting its Hawking emission.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and polarization-dependent lensing of gravitational waves in strong gravitational fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of gravitational waves can be described in terms of null geodesics by using the geometrical optics approximation. However, at large but finite frequencies the propagation is affected by the spin-orbit coupling corrections to geometrical optics, known as the gravitational spin Hall effect. Consequently, gravitational waves follow slightly different frequency- and polarization-dependent trajectories, leading to dispersive and birefringent phenomena. We study the potential for detecting the gravitational spin Hall effect in hierarchical triple black hole systems, consisting of an emitting binary orbiting a more massive body acting as a gravitational lens. We calculate the difference in time of arrival with respect to the geodesic propagation and find that it follows a simple power-law dependence on frequency with a fixed exponent. We calculate the gravitational spin Hall-corrected waveform and its mismatch with respect to the original waveform. The waveform carries a measurable imprint of the strong gravitational field if the source, lens, and observer are sufficiently aligned, or for generic observers if the source is close enough to the lens. We present constraints on dispersive time delays from GWTC-3, translated from limits on Lorentz invariance violation. Finally, we address the sensitivity of current and future ground detectors to dispersive lensing. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational spin Hall effect can be detected, providing a novel probe of general relativity and the environments of compact binary systems.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes in Noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of a massless scalar field in a Schwarzschild black hole, which is deformed due to noncommutative corrections. We introduce the deformed Schwarzschild black hole solution, which depends on the noncommutative parameter $\Theta$. We then extract the master equation as a Schr\"odinger-like equation, giving the explicit expression of the effective potential which is modified due to the noncommutative corrections. After that, we solve the master equation numerically. The significance of these results is twofold. Firstly, our results can be related to the detection of gravitational waves by the near future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA, which will have a significantly increased accuracy. In particular, these observed gravitational waves produced by binary strong gravitational systems have oscillating modes which can provide valuable information. Secondly, our results can serve as an additional tool to test the predictions of GR, as well as to examine the possible detection of this kind of gravitational corrections.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy for spherically symmetric regular black holes</title>

Abstract: The Bardeen and Hayward spacetimes are here considered as standard configurations of spherically symmetric regular black holes. Assuming the thermodynamics of such objects to be analogous to standard black holes, we compute the island formula in the regime of small topological charge and large vacuum energy, respectively for Bardeen and Hayward spacetimes. Late and early-time domains are separately discussed, with particular emphasis on the island formations. We single out conditions under which it is not possible to find out islands at early-times and how our findings depart from the standard Schwarzschild case. Motivated by the fact that those configurations extend Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Schwarzschild-de Sitter metrics through the inclusion of regularity behavior at $r=0$, we show how the effect of regularity induces modifications on the overall entanglement entropy. Finally, the Page time is also computed, showing its asymptotic behavior. Specifically, the Page time exhibits slight departures with respect to the Schwarzschild case, more evident in the Hayward metric only. Conversely, our findings on Page time show that the Bardeen regular black hole is quite indistinguishable from the Schwarzschild case.</description>

      <title>Black holes, white holes, and near-horizon physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black and white holes play remarkably contrasting roles in general relativity versus observational astrophysics. While there is overwhelming observational evidence for the existence of compact objects that are "cold, dark, and heavy", which thereby are natural candidates for black holes, the theoretically viable time-reversed variants -- the "white holes" -- have nowhere near the same level of observational support. Herein we shall explore the possibility that the connection between black and white holes is much more intimate than commonly appreciated. We shall first construct "horizon penetrating" coordinate systems that differ from the standard curvature coordinates only in a small near-horizon region, thereby emphasizing that ultimately the distinction between black and white horizons depends only on near-horizon physics. We shall then construct an explicit model for a "black-to-white transition" where all of the nontrivial physics is confined to a compact region of spacetime -- a finite-duration finite-thickness, (in principle arbitrarily small), region straddling the naive horizon. Moreover we shall show that it is possible to arrange the "black-to-white transition" to have zero action -- so that it will not be subject to destructive interference in the Feynman path integral. This then raises the very intriguing possibility that astrophysical black holes might be interpratable in terms of a quantum superposition of black and white horizons.</description>

      <title>Second-order perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime: practical, covariant and gauge-invariant formalisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-accuracy gravitational-wave modeling demands going beyond linear, first-order perturbation theory. Particularly motivated by the need for second-order perturbative models of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and black hole ringdowns, we present practical spherical-harmonic decompositions of the Einstein equation, Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, and Teukolsky equation at second perturbative order in a Schwarzschild background. Our formulations are covariant on the $t$--$r$ plane and on the two-sphere, and we express the field equations in terms of gauge-invariant metric perturbations. In a companion Mathematica package, PerturbationEquations, we provide these invariant formulas as well as the analogous formulas in terms of raw, gauge-dependent metric perturbations. Our decomposition of the second-order Einstein equation, when specialized to the Lorenz gauge, was a key ingredient in recent second-order self-force calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 021101 (2020); ibid. 127, 151102 (2021); ibid. 130, 241402 (2023)].</description>

Abstract: Massive particle and antiparticle pair production and oscillation on the horizon form a holographic and massive pair plasma state in the Friedman Universe. Via this state, the Einstein cosmology term (dark energy) interacts with matter and radiation and is time-varying $\tilde\Lambda$ in the Universe's evolution. It is determined by a close set of ordinary differential equations for dark energy, matter, and radiation energy densities. The solutions are unique, provided the initial conditions given by observations. In inflation and reheating, dark energy density decreases from the inflation scale, converting to matter and radiation energy densities. In standard cosmology, matter and radiation energy densities convert to dark energy density, reaching the present Universe. By comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, quintessence and dark energy interacting models, we show that these results can be the possible solutions for cosmological fine-tuning and coincidence problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warp-drives are solutions of general relativity widely considered unphysical due to high negative energy requirements. While the majority of the literature has focused on macroscopic solutions towards the goal of interstellar travel, in this work we explore what happens in the small radius limit. In this regime the magnitude of the total negative energy requirements gets smaller than the energy contained in a lightning bolt, more than 70 orders of magnitude less than the original Alcubierre warp drive. Such an amount could conceivably be generated with current technology by scaling up Casimir-like apparatuses. We then describe a tubular distribution of externally-generated negative energy which addresses the major issues plaguing macroscopic warp-drives and propose a concrete mechanism to accelerate and decelerate a warp. A byproduct of warp deceleration is the emission of a ray of high-energy particles. The detection of such particles could be used as the backbone of a faster-than-light communication device, reminiscent of the hyperwave of science fiction, even though significant engineering challenges remain to achieve practical communication.</description>

Abstract: This research focus on the investigation of relativistic quantum dynamics of spin0 scalar particles/fields through the utilization of the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation within the framework of an electrovacuum space-time in the presence of an external scalar potential. Specifically, we focus on a cylindrical symmetric Bonnor-Melvin magnetic universe with a cosmological constant, where the magnetic field aligns along the symmetry axis direction. We derive the radial wave equation of the KG-equation by considering a Cornell-type scalar potential in the background of magnetic universe and successfully obtain an analytical eigenvalue solution for spin-0 quantum system. Notably, our findings reveal that both the energy spectrum and the corresponding radial wave function are significantly influenced by the presence of the cosmological constant, the topology parameter of the space-time geometry, which induces a deficit in the angular coordinates, and the potential parameters.</description>

Abstract: Wormholes are geometric passages in spacetime which can connect two faraway regions of the same universe or two different universes with a shortcut. Although they are currently considered as hypothetical, they might be important observable structures that allow even time travel. But their general relativistic construction requires an exotic matter with negative energy density. The construction of wormholes containing realistic matter is a very important challenge. Therefore, in this work we investigate wormholes in the model which is non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields to gravity. Then we give some traversable wormhole geometries with realistic matter.</description>

      <title>On the linear stability of nonrelativistic selfinteracting boson stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the linear stability of selfinteracting boson stars in the nonrelativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory. For this purpose, based on a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we determine the behavior of general linear perturbations around the stationary and spherically symmetric solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson system. In particular, we conclude that ground state configurations are linearly stable if the selfinteraction is repulsive, whereas there exist a state of maximum mass that divides the stable and the unstable branches in case the selfinteraction is attractive. Regarding the excited states, they are in general unstable under generic perturbations, although we identify a stability band in the first excited states of the repulsive theory. This result is independent of the mass of the scalar field and the details of the selfinteraction potential, and it is in contrast to the situation of vanishing selfinteraction, in which excited states are always unstable.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) uniquely describe the gravitational-wave ringdown of post-merger black holes. While the linear QNM regime has been extensively studied, recent work has highlighted the importance of second-perturbative-order, quadratic QNMs (QQNMs) arising from the nonlinear coupling of linear QNMs. Previous attempts to quantify the magnitude of these QQNMs have shown discrepant results. Using a new hyperboloidal framework, we resolve the discrepancy by showing that the QQNM/QNM ratio is a function not only of the black hole parameters but also of the ratio between even- and odd-parity linear QNMs: the ratio QQNM/QNM depends on what created the ringing black hole, but only through this ratio of even- to odd-parity linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>The classical double copy in curved spacetimes: Perturbative Yang-Mills from the bi-adjoint scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a version of the double copy for classical fields in curved spacetimes. We provide a correspondence between perturbative solutions to the bi-adjoint scalar equations and those of the Yang-Mills equations in position space. At the linear level, we show that there exists a map between these solutions for maximally symmetric spacetime backgrounds, that provides every Yang-Mills solution by the action of an appropriate differential operator on a bi-adjoint scalar solution. Given the existence of a linearized map, we show that it is possible to cast the solutions of the Yang-Mills equations at arbitrary perturbation order in terms of the corresponding bi-adjoint scalar solutions. This all-order map is reminiscent of the flat space BCJ double copy, and works for any curved spacetime where the perturbative expansion holds. We show that these results have the right flat space limit, and that the correspondence is agnostic to the choice of gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10384v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gubser flow is an axis-symmetric and boost-invariant evolution in a relativistic quantum field theory which is best studied by mapping $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$ to $dS_{3}\times \mathbf{R}$ when the field theory has conformal symmetry. We show that at late de-Sitter time, which corresponds to large proper time and central region of the future wedge within $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, the holographic conformal field theory plasma can reach a state in which $\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$, with $\varepsilon$, $P_T$ and $P_L$ being the energy density, transverse and longitudinal pressures, respectively. We further determine the full sub-leading behaviour of the energy-momentum tensor at late time. Restricting to flows in which the energy density decays at large transverse distance from the central axis in $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, we show that this decay should be faster than any power law. Furthermore, in this case the energy density also vanishes in $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$ faster than any power as we go back to early proper time. Hydrodynamic behavior can appear in intermediate time.</description>

Abstract: The linear dilaton background is the keystone of a string-derived holographic correspondence beyond AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$. This motivates an exploration of the $(d+1)$-dimensional linear dilaton spacetime (LD$_{d+1}$) and its holographic properties from the low-energy viewpoint. We first notice that the LD$_{d+1}$ space has simple conformal symmetries, that we use to shape an effective field theory (EFT) on the LD background. We then place a brane in the background to study holography at the level of quantum fields and gravity. We find that the holographic correlators from the EFT feature a pattern of singularities at certain kinematic thresholds. We argue that such singularities can be used to bootstrap the putative $d$-dimensional dual theory using techniques analogous to those of the Cosmological Bootstrap program. Turning on finite temperature, we study the holographic fluid emerging on the brane in the presence of a bulk black hole. We find that the holographic fluid is pressureless for any $d$ due to a cancellation between Weyl curvature and dilaton stress tensor, and verify consistency with the time evolution of the theory. From the fluid thermodynamics, we find a universal temperature and Hagedorn behavior for any $d$. This matches the properties of a CFT$_2$ with large $T\overline T$ deformation, and of little string theory for $d=6$. Both the fluid equation of state and the spectrum of quantum fluctuations suggest that the $d$-dimensional dual theory arising from LD$_{d+1}$ is generically gapped.</description>

      <title>One- and two-argument equation of state parametrizations with continuous sound speed for neutron star simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe two fitting schemes that aim to represent the high-density part of realistic equations of state for numerical simulations such as neutron star oscillations. The low-density part of the equation of state is represented by an arbitrary polytropic crust, and we propose a generic procedure to stitch any desired crust to the high-density fit, which is performed on the internal energy, pressure and sound speed of barotropic equations of state that describe cold neutron stars in $\beta$-equilibrium. An extension of the fitting schemes to equations of state with an additional compositional argument is proposed. In particular we develop a formalism that ensures the existence of a $\beta$-equilibrium at low densities. An additional feature of this low-density model is that it can be, in principle, applied to any parametrization. The performance of the fits is checked on mass, radius and tidal deformability as well as on the dynamical radial oscillation frequencies. To that end, we use a pseudospectral isolated neutron star evolution code based on a non-conservative form of the hydrodynamical equations. A comparison to existing parametrizations is proposed, as far as possible, and to published radial frequency values in the literature. The static and dynamic quantities are well reproduced by the fitting schemes. Our results suggest that, even though the radius is very sensitive to the choice of the crust, this choice has little influence on the oscillation frequencies of a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Quasi-universal relations in the context of future neutron star detections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state dependence of neutron star's astrophysical features modeling is key to our understanding of dense matter. However, there exists a series of almost equation-of-state independent relations reported in the literature, called quasi-universal relations, that are used to determine neutron star radii and moments of inertia from X-ray and gravitational wave signals. Using sets of equations of state constrained by multi-messenger astronomy measurements and nuclear-physics theory, we discuss quasi-universal relations in the context of future gravitational-wave detectors Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, and X-ray detector STROBE-X. We focus on relations that involve the moment of inertia $I$, the tidal deformability $\Lambda$ and the compactness $C$: $C(\Lambda)$, $I(\Lambda)$ and $I(C)$. The quasi-universal fits and their associated errors are constructed with three different microphysics approaches which include state of the art nuclear physics theory and astrophysical constraints. Gravitational-wave and X-ray signals are simulated with the sensitivity of the next generation of detectors. Equation of state inference on those simulated signals is performed to assess if quasi-universal relations will offer a better precision on the extraction of neutron star's macroscopic parameters than equation of state dependent relations. We show that detections with the 3rd generation of gravitational wave detectors and the X-ray detector STROBE-X will be sensitive to the fit error marginalization technique. We also find that the sensitivity of those detectors will be sufficient that using full equation of state distributions will offer better precision on extracted parameters than quasi-universal relations.We also note that nuclear physics theory offers a more pronounced equation of state invariance of quasi-universal relations than current astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Double-well instantons in finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a toroidal space with finite volume, we derive analytically the full one-loop vacuum energy for a scalar field tunnelling between two degenerate vacua, taking into account discrete momentum. The Casimir energy is computed for an arbitrary number of dimensions using the Abel-Plana formula, while the one-loop instanton functional determinant is evaluated using the Green's functions for the fluctuation operators. The resulting energetic properties are non-trivial: both the Casimir effect and tunnelling contribute to the Null Energy Condition violation, arising from a non-extensive true vacuum energy. We discuss the relevance of this mechanism to induce a cosmic bounce, requiring no modified gravity or exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes from runaway mergers and accretion in nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid formation of supermassive black holes occurs in dense nuclear star clusters that are initially gas-dominated. Stellar-mass black hole remnants of the most massive cluster sink into the core, where a massive runaway black hole forms as a consequence of combined effects of repeated mergers and Eddington-limited gas accretion. The associated gravitational wave signals of high-redshift extreme mass-ratio inspirals are a unique signature of the nuclear star cluster scenario.</description>
