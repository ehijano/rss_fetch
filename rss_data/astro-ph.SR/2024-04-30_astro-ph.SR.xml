      <title>Effects of an Explicit Time-Dependent Radiation Pressure Force on Trajectories of Primary Neutral Hydrogen in the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation pressure exerted by solar photon output is salient to the motion of primary neutral hydrogen atoms streaming into the inner heliosphere directly from the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM). The action of a time-dependent radiation pressure force, when coupled with the usual gravitational force, changes the characteristic velocities, and therefore energies, of the atoms when they reach regions in which explorer probes are present. A study is presented that uses a 2D code to backtrace neutral hydrogen trajectories from representative target points located 1 au from the Sun. It makes use of both a radiation pressure function and a function for the photoionization rate at 1 au that oscillate with time based on measurements over a typical solar cycle, as well as a time-independent charge exchange ionization rate at 1 au. Assuming a Maxwellian distribution in the distant upwind direction, phase space data is calculated at the target points, at different moments in time. The dependence of the force on the radial particle velocity has been omitted in the analysis, such that the emphasis is on the effects of the global solar UV intensity variations through the solar cycle. This process allows for analysis of direct and indirect Maxwellian components through time and space in the time-dependent force environment. Additionally, pseudo-bound orbits caused by energy losses associated with this force environment are observed and their properties evaluated with the aim of determining their effects on potential measurements by explorer probes.</description>

      <title>Deneb is a Large Amplitude Polarimetric Variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We write to report the discovery that Deneb is a large amplitude polarization variable. Over a ~400 d time span from August 2022 Deneb's polarization was typically around 3900 parts-per-million (ppm) in the SDSS g'-band. Yet, it varied by several hundred ppm in an irregular way on a timescale of weeks. The largest polarization change, amounting to 2500 ppm, occurred shortly after the last pulsation ``resumption'' event identified by Abt et al. (2023) in TESS photometry. The relationship between the observed polarization -- particularly corresponding to the resumption event -- and its brightness and H-alpha spectra suggests a mechanism involving density changes in its wind and/or extended atmosphere. Smaller effects due to pulsations are not ruled out and further study is recommended.</description>

      <title>Shaping the nebula around the symbiotic system R Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) obtained with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) at the 2.1 m telescope of the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory (Mexico). An interpretation of these data is presented by means of the shape software to disclose the morpho-kinematics of the nebulosities associated with R Aqr. The best model that reproduces narrow-band images and position-velocity diagrams is composed by three structures: an outer (large) hourglass structure surrounding an inner bipolar with a spiral-like filament entwined around the later. Different expansion velocity patterns are predefined for each structure, which predict kinematic ages of $\tau_{1}$=450$\pm$25 yr (outer hourglass), $\tau_{2}$=240$\pm$20 yr (inner bipolar) and $\tau_{3}$=215$\pm$20 yr (spiral-like filament). We suggest that the spiral-like filament is tracing the regions of interaction of the precessing jet with the circumstellar material, which simultaneously carves the inner bipolar structure. If a similar process created the large hourglass structure, it means that the action of the jet ceased for about 230 yr. We discuss the implication for other unresolved symbiotic systems detected in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators and Other Short-Period Variable Stars in OGLE-IV Fields for the Outer Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we search the OGLE-IV outer Galactic bulge fields for short-period variable objects. The investigation focuses on unexplored timescales roughly below one hour in an area containing about 700 million stellar sources down to approximately I=20 mag. We concentrate mainly on Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs), which represent a recently discovered enigmatic class of short-period hot subluminous stars. We find 33 BLAPs in the period range from 7.5 to 66.5 min. Thirty-one of them are new discoveries, which increases the number of known stars of this class to over one hundred. Additional eighteen objects with pulsation-like light curve shapes and periods ranging from 17.3 to 53.7 min are presented. Very likely, these are $\delta$ Sct/SX Phe-type stars, but some of them could be pulsating hot subdwarfs or BLAPs. We also report on the detection of five eclipsing binary systems with orbital periods between 61.2 and 121.9 min and three mysterious variable objects with I-band amplitudes larger than 0.9 mag. A spectroscopic follow-up would help in the final classification of the variables.</description>

      <title>Numerous Bidirectionally Propagating Plasma Blobs near the Reconnection Site of a Solar Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current sheet is a common structure involved in solar eruptions. However, it is observed in minority of the events and the physical properties of its fine structures during a solar eruption are rarely investigated. Here, we report an on-disk observation that displays 108 compact, circular or elliptic bright structures, presumably plasma blobs, propagating bidirectionally along a flare current sheet during a period of $\sim$24 minutes. From extreme ultraviolet images, we have investigated the temporal variation of the blob number around the flare peak time. The current sheet connects the flare loops and the erupting filament. The width, duration, projected velocity, temperature, and density of these blobs are $\sim$1.7$\pm$0.5\,Mm, $\sim$79$\pm$57\,s, $\sim$191$\pm$81\,\kms, $\sim$10$^{6.4\pm0.1}$ K, and $\sim$10$^{10.1\pm0.3}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The reconnection site rises with a velocity of $\leqslant$69\,\kms. The observational results suggest that plasmoid instability plays an important role in the energy release process of solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Parameters and Evolutionary Status of V454 Aurigae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binary systems have a unique feature, which enables scientists to obtain precise fundamental star parameters, which opens to greater area of astrophysics studies. In this study, we have derived the fundamental parameters, the evolutionary status, and the birthplace of V454 Aur in the Galaxy by combining radial velocity, photometric, and spectral energy distribution data. We have updated ephemerides and period of V454 Aur as $2458850.80136_{-0.00001}^{\,+0.00001}$ and $27.0198177_{-0.0000003}^{\,+0.0000003}$, respectively. We obtain $1.173^{\,+0.016}_{-0.016}$ $M_\odot$ and $1.203^{\,+0.022}_{-0.026}$ $R_\odot$ for the primary component and $1.045^{\,+0.015}_{-0.014}$ $M_\odot$ and $0.993^{\,+0.034}_{-0.027}$ $R_\odot$ for the secondary component. The effective temperatures for the components are accurately determined via SED data as $6250^{\,+150}_{-150}$ K and $5966^{\,+109}_{-89}$ K for the primary component and the secondary component, respectively. The metallicity of the components is derived from evolutionary tracks, which implies slightly higher than Solar metallicity. According to analysis, the components of V454 Aur are on the main sequence. Our distance calculation for the system is, which is $65.07^{\,+2}_{-3}$ pc, in excellent agreement with \textit{Gaia} astrometric data, which is $65.07^{\,+0.09}_{-0.09}$ pc. The current age of the system is $1.19_{-0.09}^{\,+0.08}$ Gyr, and it will start to mass transfer between components in 5 Gyr from now on. Dynamical orbital analysis shows that V454 Aur follows a boxy pattern around the Galactic centre and is a member of the thin-disc component of the Galaxy. Considering the age and metallicity of this system, it was found to have formed just outside the Solar circle.</description>

      <title>The Asymmetric Bipolar Fe II Jet and H2 Outflow of TMC1A Resolved with JWST's NIRSpec IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Protostellar outflows exhibit large variations in their structure depending on the observed gas emission. This study analyzes the atomic jet and molecular outflow in the Class I protostar, TMC1A to characterize morphology and identify previously undetected spatial features with JWST's NIRSpec IFU. In addition to identifying a large number of Fe II and H2 lines, we have detected the bipolar Fe jet by revealing, for the first time, the presence of a red-shifted atomic jet. Similarly, the red-shifted component of the H2 slower wide-angle outflow is observed. Both Fe II and H2 red-shifted emission exhibit significantly lower flux densities compared to their blue-shifted counterparts. Additionally, we report the detection of a collimated high-velocity (100 km s-1), blue-shifted H2 outflow, suggesting the presence of a molecular jet in addition to the well-known wider angle low-velocity structure. The Fe II and H2 jets show multiple intensity peaks along the jet axis, which may be associated with ongoing or recent outburst events. In addition to the variation in their intensities, the H2 wide-angle outflow exhibits a "ring"-like structure. The blue-shifted H2 outflow also shows a left-right brightness asymmetry likely due to interactions with the surrounding ambient medium and molecular outflows. Using the Fe II line ratios, the extinction along the atomic jet is estimated to be between Av = 10-30 on the blue-shifted side, with a trend of decreasing extinction with distance from the protostar. A similar Av is found for the red-shifted side, supporting the argument for an intrinsic red-blue outflow lobe asymmetry rather than environmental effects such as extinction. This intrinsic difference revealed by the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST, suggests that younger outflows already exhibit the red-blue side asymmetry more commonly observed towards jets associated with Class II disks.</description>

      <title>Broad and Bi-directional narrow quasi-periodic fast-propagating wave trains associated with a filament-driven halo CME on 2023 April 21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents three distinct wave trains that occurred on 2023 April 21: a broad quasi-periodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave train and a bi-directional narrow QFP wave train. The broad QFP wave train expands outward in a circular wavefront, while bi-directional narrow QFP wave trains propagate in the northward and southward directions, respectively. The concurrent presence of the wave trains offers a remarkable opportunity to investigate their respective triggering mechanisms. Measurement shows that the broad QFP wave train's speed is 300- 1100 km/s in different propagating directions. There is a significant difference in the speed of the bi-directional narrow QFP wave trains: the southward propagation achieves 1400 km/s, while the northward propagation only reaches about 550 km/s accompanied by a deceleration of about 1- 2 kms-2. Using the wavelet analysis, we find that the periodicity of the propagating wave trains in the southward and northward directions closely matches the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) exhibited by the flares. Based on these results, the narrow QFP wave trains were most likely excited by the intermittent energy release in the accompanying flare. In contrast, the broad QFP wave train had a tight relationship with the erupting filament, probably attributed to the unwinding motion of the erupting filament or the leakage of the fast sausage wave train inside the filament body.</description>

      <title>Cool matter distribution in inner solar corona from 2023 total solar eclipse observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar corona has been judged to consist of free electrons and highly ionized ions with extremely high temperature as a widely accepted knowledge. This view is changed by our eclipse observations. Distributions of cool matter represented by neutral iron atoms in hot inner solar corona are presented via derived global maps of solar Fraunhofer(F-) and Emission(E-) coronae, compared with those of continuum(Kontinuierlich, K-) corona formed by free electrons. The maps are obtained from simultaneous observations of dual filtering bands centered respectively at 659.4nm and 660.1nm, performed from twin telescopes during the total solar eclipse on April 20, 2023 at Com town of East Timor, assisted for judgement via spectral images obtained by a portable spectrograph. They show respectively presences of these neutral iron atoms yielding 659.3nm and 659.4nm lines in both the quiet sun and active regions. The distribution of the cool matter in form of line depression forms an inner F-corona, different from that of the cool matter in form of line enhancement. Both the distributions show a crucial difference from that of the free electrons represented by the K-corona map. It is also found that intensities of the F-corona and the E-corona induced by these neutral atoms are only small fractions of the K-corona, and the diffusion can be seen clearly in all these maps. They uncover also that the coronal heating resources do not distribute pervasively but likely form a thermodynamic griddle where minor photospheric neutral atoms can escape from the heating into the corona globally.</description>

      <title>The catalog of Hvar Observatory solar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compile the catalog of Hvar Observatory solar observations in the time period corresponding to regular digitally stored chromospheric and photospheric observations 2010-2019. We make basic characterisation of observed phenomena and compare them to catalogs which are based on full disc solar images. We compile a catalog of observed ARs consisting of 1100 entries, where each AR is classified according to McIntosh and Mt Wilson classifications. We find that HVAR observations are biased towards more frequently observing more complex ARs and observing them in longer time periods, likely related to the small FOV not encompassing the whole solar disc. In H$\alpha$ observations we catalog conspicuous filaments/prominences and flares. We characterise filaments according to their location, chirality (if possible) and eruptive signatures. Analysis of the eruptive filaments reveals a slight bias in HVAR catalog towards observation of partial eruptions, possibly related to the observers tendency to observe filament which already showed some activity. In the flare catalog we focus on their observed eruptive signatures (loops or ribbons) and their shape. In addition, we associate them to GOES soft X-ray flares to determine their corresponding class. We find that HVAR observations seem biased towards more frequently observing stronger flares and observing them in longer time periods. We demonstrate the feasibility of the catalog on a case study of the flare detected on 2 August 2011 in HVAR H$\alpha$ observations and related Sun-to-Earth phenomena. Through flare-CME-ICME association we demonstrate the agreement of remote and in situ properties. The data used for this study, as well as the catalog, are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Massive stars evolution with new C12+C12 nuclear reaction rate -- the core carbon-burning phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear reactions drive the stellar evolution and contribute to the stellar and galactic chemicals abundances. New determinations of the nuclear reaction rates for key fusion reactions of stellar evolution are now available, paving the way to improved stellar model predictions. We explore the impact of new C12+C12 reaction rates for massive stars evolution, structure, and nucleosynthesis during core carbon-burning phase. We analyse the consequences for stars of different masses including rotation-induced mixing. We computed a grid of massive stars at solar metallicity using the stellar evolution code GENEC. We explored the results using three different references for the rates, with or without rotation. We study the effect in terms of evolution, structure, and critical mass limit between intermediate and massive stars. We explored the consequences for nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase by means of a one-zone nucleosynthesis code. We confirm the significant impact of using the recent nuclear reaction rates following the hindrance hypothesis as well as the mass-dependent effect of a resonance at 2.14 MeV. This impacts the characteristics of the core of stars from the C-ignition and during all the core C-burning phase. The change of rates modifies the central nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase, resulting in an underproduction of s-process elements. The correct and accurate determination of the nuclear reaction rates, with especially the existence and location of resonances, impacts stellar evolution in many aspects affecting the model predictions. The choice of the nuclear reaction rates reference for the C12+C12 fusion reaction changes significantly the behaviour of the core during the C-burning phase. This choice is then to be taken carefully in order to interpret stellar evolution and fate of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Sausage, kink, and fluting MHD wave modes identified in solar magnetic pores by Solar Orbiter/PHI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar pores are intense concentrations of magnetic flux that emerge through the Sun's photosphere. When compared to sunspots, they are much smaller in diameter and hence can be impacted and buffeted by neighbouring granular activity to generate significant magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave energy flux within their confines. However, observations of solar pores from ground-based telescope facilities may struggle to capture subtle motions synonymous with higher-order MHD wave signatures due to seeing effects produced in the Earth's atmosphere. Hence, we have exploited timely seeing-free and high-quality observations of four small magnetic pores from the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) on board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. Through acquisition of data under stable observing conditions, we have been able to measure the area fluctuations and horizontal displacements of the solar pores. Cross correlations between perturbations in intensity, area, line-of-sight velocity, and magnetic fields, coupled with the first-time application of novel Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques on the boundary oscillations, provide a comprehensive diagnosis of the embedded MHD waves as sausage and kink modes. Additionally, the previously elusive m = 2 fluting mode is identified in the most magnetically isolated of the four pores. An important consideration lies in how the identified wave modes contribute towards the transfer of energy into the upper solar atmosphere. We find that the four pores examined have approximately 56%, 72%, 52%, and 34% of their total wave energy associated with the identified sausage modes, and around 23%, 17%, 39%, and 49% to their kink modes, respectively, while the first pore also has around an 11% contribution linked to the fluting mode. This study marks the first-time identification of concurrent sausage, kink, and fluting MHD wave modes in solar magnetic pores.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic tornadoes, characterized as impulsive Alfven waves initiated by photospheric vortices in intergranular lanes, are considered efficient energy channels to the corona. Despite their acknowledged importance for solar coronal heating, their observational counterparts from the corona have not been well understood. To address this issue, we use a radiative MHD simulation of a coronal loop with footpoints rooted in the upper convection zone, and synthesize the chromospheric and coronal emissions corresponding to a magnetic tornado. Considering SDO/AIA 171 A and Solar Orbiter/EUI 174 A channels, our synthesis reveals that the coronal response to magnetic tornadoes can be observed as an EUV brightening of which width is ~2 Mm. This brightening is located above the synthesized chromospheric swirl observed in Ca II 8542 A, Ca II K, and Mg II k lines, which can be detected by instruments such as SST/CRISP, GST/FISS, and IRIS. Considering the height correspondence of the synthesized brightening, magnetic tornadoes can be an alternative mechanism for the small-scale EUV brightenings such as the solar "campfires''. Our findings indicate that coordinated observations encompassing the chromosphere to the corona are indispensable for comprehending the origin of coronal EUV brightenings.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a [O III] Emission Shell Around the X-ray Binary CI Cam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a $8' \times 12'$ emission shell brightest in [O III] centered on the X-ray binary B[e] star, CI Cameleopardalis (CI Cam). This shell, detected during a survey of optical emission associated with the Galactic supernova remnant G150.3+4.5, is seen outside but immediately adjacent to the remnant's optical filaments along its northwestern edge. Assuming this shell is related to CI Cam's strong winds and transient outbursts, the adoption of CI Cam's Gaia DR3 statistically corrected distance of 4.1$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc yields shell dimensions $\simeq$ 9.5 pc $\times$ 14.3 pc. While the distance to the G150.3+4.5 remnant is uncertain, the appearance of CI Cam's emission shell so close to the SNR's optical filaments appears likely to be a chance coincidence.</description>

      <title>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. V. Distance Estimation with Neutrinos Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multi-messenger observations of supernovae. Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to supernovae using quantitative analysis techniques for supernova neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star and the distance to the supernova. The radius of a neutron star is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the supernova can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of supernovae, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multi-messenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to supernovae through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of neutron star radii. This data, via the neutron star mass-radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Turbulence statistics of HI clouds entrained in the Milky Way's nuclear wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is ubiquitously turbulent across many physically distinct environments within the Galaxy. Turbulence is key in controlling the structure and dynamics of the ISM, regulating star formation, and transporting metals within the Galaxy. We present the first observational measurements of turbulence in neutral hydrogen entrained in the hot nuclear wind of the Milky Way. Using recent MeerKAT observations of two extra-planar HI clouds above (gal. lat.$\,\sim7.0^{\circ}$) and below (gal. lat.$\,\sim-3.9^{\circ}$) the Galactic disc, we analyse centroid velocity and column density maps to estimate the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v,\mathrm{3D}}$), the turbulent sonic Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), the volume density dispersion ($\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$), and the turbulence driving parameter ($b$). We also present a new prescription for estimating the spatial temperature variations of HI in the presence of related molecular gas. We measure these turbulence quantities on the global scale of each cloud, but also spatially map their variation across the plane-of-sky extent of each cloud by using a roving kernel method. We find that the two clouds share very similar characteristics of their internal turbulence, despite their varying latitudes. Both clouds are in the sub-to-trans-sonic Mach regime, and have primarily compressively-driven ($b\sim1$) turbulence. Given that there is no known active star-formation present in these clouds, this may be indicative of the way the cloud-wind interaction injects energy into the entrained atomic material on parsec scales.</description>

Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) form a mysterious class of variable stars with typical periods of tens of minutes and amplitudes above 0.1 mag. In this work, we present results of a variability search focused on timescales shorter than 1 h, conducted in OGLE-IV Galactic disk fields containing about 1.1 billion stellar sources down to I$\approx$20 mag. Twenty-five BLAPs have been detected, 20 of which are new discoveries. Their periods range from 8.4 min to 62.1 min. We have also found six new eclipsing binary systems with orbital periods from 38.3 min to 121.3 min and five short-period large-amplitude (&gt; 0.17 mag in the I-band) variable stars of unknown type.</description>

      <title>Variability of Blue Supergiants in the LMC with TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blue supergiant (BSG) problem, namely, the overabundance of BSGs inconsistent with classical stellar evolution theory, remains an open question in stellar astrophysics. Several theoretical explanations have been proposed, which may be tested by their predictions for the characteristic time variability. In this work, we analyze the light curves of a sample of 20 BSGs obtained from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. We report a characteristic signal in the low-frequency ($f\lesssim2\;\mathrm{day}^{-1}$) range for all our targets. The amplitude spectrum has a peak frequency at $\sim0.2\;\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, and we are able to fit it by a modified Lorentzian profile. The signal itself shows strong stochasticity across different TESS sectors, suggesting its driving mechanism happens on short ($\lesssim\mathrm{months}$) timescales. Our signals resemble those obtained for a limited sample of hotter OB stars and yellow supergiants, suggesting their possible common origins. We discuss three possible physical explanations: stellar winds launched by rotation, convection motions that reach the stellar surface, and waves from the deep stellar interior. The peak frequency of the signal favors processes related to the convective zone caused by the iron opacity peak, and the shape of the spectra might be explained by the propagation of high-order, damped gravity waves excited from that zone. We discuss the uncertainties and limitations of all these scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AIMS 1. To use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data to test the accepted theory that type-III radiation is produced by counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the electromagnetic wave at twice the Langmuir frequency. 2. If this theory is found to be incorrect, to replace it with a description of type-III generation that is consistent with the PSP data.
  METHODS To obtain new properties of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics, their phase velocities and density fluctuations were measured. If the harmonic wave was electromagnetic, as in the accepted theory, these quantities would not be measurable. However, in an electrostatic wave, they would be measurable by the PSP instruments.
  RESULTS The Langmuir wave and its harmonics at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 2PI*125 kHz is the Langmuir frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, were measured in an active type-III event. The lowest harmonics contained density fluctuations, so they were electrostatic waves and not type-III emissions. This result was bolstered by measuring their very slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) which are not those of a type-III wave. Thus, the harmonic waves were not a result of the three-wave interaction (as required by the accepted theory) but they were electrostatic antenna waves produced by radiation of the Langmuir wave. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hot post-AGB star in Galactic globular cluster E3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new hot post-asymptotic giant branch (PAGB) star in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) E3, which is one of the first of the identified PAGB stars in a GC to show a binary signature. The star stands out as the brightest source in E3 in the \mbox{{\em Astrosat}}/UVIT images. We confirmed its membership with the cluster E3 using Gaia DR3 kinematics and parallax measurements. We supplemented the photometric observations with radial velocities (RVs) from high-resolution spectroscopic observations at two epochs and with ground- and space-based photometric observations from 0.13 $\mu$m to 22 $\mu$m. We find that the RVs vary over $\sim$6 \kms\ between the two epochs. This is an indication of the star being in a binary orbit. A simulation of possible binary systems with the observed RVs suggests a binary period of either 39.12 days or 17.83 days with mass ratio q$\geq$1.0. The [Fe/H] derived using the high-resolution spectra is $\sim -$0.7 dex, which closely matches the cluster metallicity. The spectroscopic and photometric measurements suggest \Teff\ and $\log g$ of the star as 17\,500$\pm$1\,000~K and 2.37$\pm$0.20~dex, respectively. Various PAGB evolutionary tracks on the Hertzsprung--Russell (H-R) diagram suggest a current mass of the star in the range 0.51$-$0.55 \Msun. The star is enriched with C and O abundances, showing similar CNO abundances compared to the other PAGB stars in GCs with the evidence of the third dredge-up on the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>Tidal Spin-up of Black Hole Progenitor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations indicate the existence of merging black holes (BHs) with high spin ($a\gtrsim0.3$), whose formation pathways are still an open question. A possible way to form those binaries is through the tidal spin-up of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by its BH companion. In this work, we investigate this scenario by directly calculating the tidal excitation of oscillation modes in WR star models, determining the tidal spin-up rate, and integrating the coupled spin-orbit evolution for WR-BH binaries. We find that for short-period orbits and massive WR stars, the tidal interaction is mostly contributed by standing gravity modes, in contrast to Zahn's model of travelling waves which is frequently assumed in the literature. The standing modes are less efficiently damped than traveling waves, meaning that prior estimates of tidal spin-up may be overestimated. We show that tidal synchronization is rarely reached in WR-BH binaries, and the resulting BH spins have $a \lesssim 0.4$ for all but the shortest period ($P_{\rm orb} \! \lesssim 0.5 \, {\rm d}$) binaries. Tidal spin-up in lower-mass systems is more efficient, providing an anti-correlation between the mass and spin of the BHs, which could be tested in future gravitational wave data. Nonlinear damping processes are poorly understood but may allow for more efficient tidal spin-up. We also discuss a new class of gravito-thermal modes that appear in our calculations.</description>

      <title>Open superclusters I: The most populated primordial groups of open clusters in the third quadrant of the Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open supercluster (OSC) is defined as a cluster of at least six open clusters (OCs) born from the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). We survey the recent catalogs of OCs based on Gaia data and relevant literature to find 17 OSCs of the third galactic quadrant, along with 190 likely members of them. OSCs are frequent enough to be considered an extra class of objects in the hierarchy of star formation. Some of these supersystems are new and most of them contain more members than previously thought. The detailed study of some OSCs has leaded to the discovery of four new young clusters that are members of them, named Casado-Hendy 2 to 5. In certain instances, subgroups with distinct PMs or 3D positions have been found within an OSC, suggesting the presence of multiple generations of stars formed from several bursts of star formation within the same GMC. OSCs are typically unbound and tend to disintegrate on timescales of 0.1 Gyr. The present results support the Primordial Group hypothesis (Casado 2022) and suggest that globular clusters are not formed from the accretion of open superclusters, at least in the local Universe at late times.</description>

      <title>Effects of Annihilation with Low-Energy Neutrinos on High-Energy Neutrinos from Binary Neutron Star Mergers and Rare Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that high-energy (HE) neutrinos produced from choked jets can be annihilated with low-energy (LE) neutrinos emitted from the accretion disk around a black hole in binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae. For HE neutrinos produced close to the stellar center ($\lesssim 10^{9}-10^{12}$ cm), we find that the emerging all-flavor spectrum for neutrinos of $E\gtrsim 0.1-1$ PeV could be modified by a factor $E^{-n}$ with $n\gtrsim 0.4-0.5$ under realistic conditions. Flavor evolution of LE neutrinos does not affect this result but can change the emerging flavor composition of HE neutrinos. As a consequence, the above annihilation effect may need to be considered for HE neutrinos produced from choked jets at small radii. We briefly discuss the annihilation effects for different HE neutrino production models and point out that such effects could be tested through precise measurements of the diffuse neutrino spectrum and flavor composition.</description>

      <title>On the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars by studying the population of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach accounts for the measurement uncertainties of individual observations and selection effects. Without correcting for selection effects, as done in previous studies, we find that pulsar initial spin periods follow a Weibull distribution, peaking at 40~ms, which is favoured against the log-normal distribution with a Bayes factor of 200. The known selection effects in radio pulsar surveys, including pulse broadening and a period-dependent beaming fraction, have been quantitatively investigated. We show that, based on measurements of pulsar luminosity and spin period from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue, the impact of pulse broadening on the inference of pulsar period distribution is likely to be insignificant. Correcting for the beaming selection effect, a Weibull distribution remains to be the preferred model, while its peak slightly shifts to longer periods at 50~ms. Our method will prove useful in constraining the birth properties of neutron stars in the Square Kilometre Array era.</description>
