      <title>Categories and functors of universal algebraic geometry. Automorphic equivalence of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal algebraic geometry allows considering of geometric properties of every universal algebra. When two algebras have same algebraic geometry? We must consider the categories of algebraic closed sets of these algebras to answer this question. The complete coincidence of these categories gives us a concept of the geometric equivalence of algebras. Some type of isomorphisms of these categories gives us a concept of the automorphic equivalence of algebras. This concept has been considered since article B. Plotkin, Algebras with the same (algebraic) geometry. Proceedings of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. 242 (2003), 17--207. DOI: 10.1134/S0081543812070048. We will give by language of category theory one more elegant definition of this concept and recall some theorems related to this concept.</description>

      <title>Factorization algebras in quite a lot of generality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a first stab at a mathematical framework in which one can study quantum field theories on spacetimes with quite general geometries. We will study these theories via their factorization algebras. The aim is to identify a minimalist formalism that makes sense of factorization algebras in any geometric context. This formalism extends the technology of factorization algebras to many new contexts, including those arising in arithmetic quantum field theories.
  In order to make sense of factorization algebras on a geometric object X, one needs two ingredients. First, one needs an additional piece of structure on X that we call an "isolability structure." This is the data required to say whether two (generalized) points of X are "distant." This is encoded as a functor from a certain combinatorial category of cographs. Second, one needs some sort of sheaf theory. The isolability structure then induces on the category of sheaves a kind of twofold symmetric monoidal structure. Factorization algebras are then defined in terms of this structure.
  This paper develops this formalism. We describe how some existing theories of factorization algebras fit into this framework, and we give a construction of the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian as a factorization stack that works in quite a lot of generality.</description>

      <title>Auslander correspondence for truncated connective DG-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a $d$-dimensional Auslander correspondence for $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebras via $d$-extended module categories. A $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebra $\Gamma$ is called Auslander if its $d$-extended module category is a $d$-Auslander extriangulated category. Our main theorem gives a one-to-one correspondence: for any $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebra $\Lambda$ whose $d$-extended module category has finitely many indecomposable objects, the DG-endomorphism algebra of an additive generator is Auslander, and conversely every Auslander $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebra arises in this way.</description>

      <title>The $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories in simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory (STT) was introduced by Riehl and Shulman to leverage homotopy type theory to prove results about $(\infty,1)$-categories. Initial work on simplicial type theory focused on "formal" arguments in higher category theory and, in particular, no non-trivial examples of $\infty$-category theory were constructible within STT. More recent work has changed this state of affairs by applying techniques developed initial for cubical type theory to construct the $\infty$-category of spaces. We complete this process by constructing the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories, recovering one of the main foundational results of $\infty$-category theory (straightening--unstraightening) purely type-theoretically. We also show how this construction enables new examples of the directed version of the structure identity principle, the structure homomorphism principle.</description>

      <title>Model Structures Arising from Extendable Cotorsion Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct exact model structures from so called extendable cotorsion pairs. Given a hereditary Hovey triple $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W}, \mathcal{F})$ in a weakly idempotent complete exact category with enough projectives and injectives. If one of the cotorsion pairs $(\mathcal{C}\cap\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{F})$ and $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W}\cap\mathcal{F})$ is extendable, then there is a chain of hereditary Hovey triples whose corresponding homotopy categories coincide. As applications, we obtain a new description of the $Q$-shaped derived categories introduced by Holm and J\o rgensen. We can also interpret the Krause's recollement in terms of ``$n$-dimensional'' homotopy categories. Finally, we have two approaches to get ``$n$-dimensional'' hereditary Hovey triples, which are proved to coincide, in the category Rep$(Q,\mathcal{A})$ of all representations of a rooted quiver $Q$ with values in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$.</description>

      <title>Unstable $1$-semiadditivity as classifying Goodwillie towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stable $\infty$-category is $1$-semiadditive if the norms for all finite group actions are equivalences. In the presence of $1$-semiadditivity, Goodwillie calculus simplifies drastically. We introduce two variants of $1$-semiadditivity for an $\infty$-category $C$ and study their relation to the Goodwillie calculus of functors $C \rightarrow \s(C)$. We demonstrate that these variations of $1$-semiadditivity are complete obstructions to the problem of endowing $\partial_\ast F$ with either a right module or a divided power right module structure which completely classifies the Goodwillie tower of $F$. We find applications to algebraic localizations of spaces, the Morita theory of operads, and bar-cobar duality of algebras. Along the way, we address several milestones in these areas including: Lie structures in the Goodwillie calculus of spaces, spectral Lie algebra models of $v_h$-periodic homotopy theory, and the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality of $E_d$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau structures on derived and singularity categories of symmetric orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $\Lambda$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $\Lambda$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $\Lambda$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $\Lambda$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.</description>

      <title>Higher Verlinde categories of reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define tensor categories ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}(G)$ in characteristic $p$ for connected reductive groups $G$ and positive integers $n$, generalising the semisimple Verlinde categories ${\sf Ver}_p(G)$ originating from Gelfand-Kazhdan and the higher Verlinde categories ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ for ${\rm SL}_2$ defined by Benson-Etingof-Ostrik. The construction is based on the definition of ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ as an abelian envelope of a quotient of a category of tilting modules, but we also introduce an expanded construction which refines the ${\rm SL}_2$ case and gives new results. In particular, the union ${\sf Ver}_{p^\infty}(G)$ can be derived from the perfection of $G$; certain exact sequences in ${\sf Rep}G$ map to exact sequences in ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}(G)$; and the underlying abelian category of ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ can be expressed as a subcategory of ${\sf Rep}{\rm SL}_2$, or as a Serre quotient of a subcategory of ${\sf Rep}{\rm SL}_2$.</description>
