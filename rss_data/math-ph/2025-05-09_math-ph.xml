      <title>Higher symmetries and anomalies in quantum lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an 't Hooft anomaly index for a group acting on a 2d quantum lattice system by finite-depth circuits. It takes values in the degree-4 cohomology of the group and is an obstruction to on-siteability of the group action. We introduce a 3-group (modeled as a crossed square) describing higher symmetries of a 2d lattice system and show that the 2d anomaly index is an obstruction for promoting a symmetry action to a morphism of 3-groups. This demonstrates that 't Hooft anomalies are a consequence of a mixing between ordinary symmetries and higher symmetries. Similarly, to any 1d lattice system we attach a 2-group (modeled as a crossed module) and interpret the Nayak-Else anomaly index as an obstruction for promoting a group action to a morphism of 2-groups. The meaning of indices of Symmetry Protected Topological states is also illuminated by higher group symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the Higher Categorical Structure of Topological Defects in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unifying mathematical framework describing the higher categorical structures formed by topological defects in quantum field theory equipped with tangential structures, such as orientations, framings, or $\operatorname{Pin}^{\pm}$-structures, in terms of structured versions of higher dagger categories. This recovers all previously known results, including the description of oriented topological defects in 2-dimensional quantum field theories by pivotal bicategories. Assuming the stratified cobordism hypothesis, we prove our proposal for topological defects with stable tangential structures that admit a direct sum in fully extended topological quantum field theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Santosh Kumar was an active researcher on the topic of exact results in random matrix theory and their various applications, particularly to quantum chaos and information theory. Barely entering his mid-career, he died unexpectedly on the 18th October 2024. The present article gives an account of some of his research directions and findings. As well as serving as a tribute to his work, this is done also for the purpose of providing a resource for those who may continue along related lines in the future.</description>

      <title>The effective energy of a lattice metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sense in which the continuum limit of a broad class of discrete materials with periodic structures can be viewed as a nonlinear elastic material. While we are not the first to consider this question, our treatment is more general and more physical than those in the literature. Indeed, it applies to a broad class of systems, including ones that possess mechanisms; and we discuss how the degeneracy that plagues prior work in this area can be avoided by penalizing change of orientation. A key motivation for this work is its relevance to mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. Such systems often have ``soft modes'', achieved in typical examples by modulating mechanisms. Our results permit the following more general definition of a soft mode: it is a macroscopic deformation whose effective energy vanishes -- in other words, one whose spatially-averaged elastic energy tends to zero in the continuum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It follows from Grothendieck's little inequality that to any complex (m x n) matrix X of column norm at most 1, and an 0 &lt;e &lt;1, there exist a natural number q, an (m x q) matrix C with
  $(1-e)^2 \leq CC^* \leq (4/\pi) (1 + e)^2$
  and an (q x n ) matrix Z with entries in the complex torus such that X= q$^{-(1/2)}$(CZ). Both of Grothendieck's complex inequalities follow from this factorization result.</description>

      <title>Is spacetime curved? Assessing the underdetermination of general relativity and teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realism about general relativity (GR) seems to imply realism about spacetime curvature. The existence of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) calls this into question, for (a) TEGR is set in a torsionful but flat spacetime, and (b) TEGR is empirically equivalent to GR. Knox (2011) claims that there is no genuine underdetermination between GR and TEGR; we call this verdict into question by isolating and addressing her individual arguments. In addition, we anticipate and evaluate two further worries for realism about the torsionful spacetimes of TEGR, which we call the "problem of operationalisability" and the "problem of visualisability".</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for non-self-adjoint Dirac operators with periodic potentials and inverse scattering transform for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the inverse spectral theory for a non-self-adjoint one-dimensional Dirac operator associated periodic potentials via a Riemann-Hilbert problem approach. We use the resulting formalism to solve the initial value problem for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We establish a uniqueness theorem for the solutions of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, which provides a new method for obtaining the potential from the spectral data. The formalism applies for both finite- and infinite-genus potentials. As in the defocusing case, the formalism shows that only a single set of Dirichlet eigenvalues is needed in order to uniquely reconstruct the potential of the Dirac operator and the corresponding solution of the focusing NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for non-Hermitian Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the modulus of the extreme eigenvalues is investigated for the complex Ginibre and complex induced Ginibre ensembles in the limit of large dimensions of random matrices. The limiting distribution of the scaled spectral radius and the scaled minimum modulus for the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, with a proportional rectangularity index, is the Gumbel distribution. The independence of these extrema is established, at appropriate scaling, for large matrices from the complex Ginibre ensemble as well as from the complex induced Ginbre ensemble for either fixed or proportional rectangularity indexes. The joint distribution of the eigenvalues moduli for the complex Ginibre ensemble is derived in this paper. It is equal to the joint distribution of independent random variables each following a Gamma-Rayleigh distribution. In the limit of a large size of the complex Ginibre matrices, the left and right tail distributions of the minimum modulus are the Rayleigh and Weibull distributions, respectively. The limiting left tail distribution of minimum modulus is the same for these non-Hermitian ensembles when the rectangularity index of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble is equal to zero. This phenomenon is also verified for the right tail distribution of this minimum.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for one-dimensional dynamical Dirac system (BC-method)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A forward problem for the Dirac system is to find $u=\begin{pmatrix}u_1(x,t)\\u_2(x,t)\end{pmatrix}$ obeying $iu_t+\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1\\-1&amp;0\end{pmatrix}u_x+\begin{pmatrix}p&amp;q\\q&amp;-p\end{pmatrix}u=0$ for $x&gt;0,\,t&gt;0$;\,\,$u(x,0)=\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}$ for $x {\geqslant} 0 $, and $u_1(0,t)=f(t)$ for $t&gt;0$, with the real $p=p(x), q=q(x)$. An input--output map $R: u_1(0,\cdot)\mapsto u_2(0,\cdot)$ is of the convolution form $Rf=if+r\ast f$, where $r=r(t)$ is a {\it response function}. By hyperbolicity of the system, for any $T&gt;0$, function $r\big|_{0 {\leqslant} t {\leqslant} 2T}$ is determined by $p,q\big|_{0 {\leqslant} x {\leqslant} T}$.
  An inverse problem is: for an (arbitrary) fixed $T&gt;0$, given $r\big|_{0 {\leqslant} t {\leqslant} 2T}$ to recover $p,q\big|_{0 {\leqslant} x {\leqslant} T}$. The procedure that determines $p,q$ is proposed, and the characteristic solvability conditions on $r$ are provided.
  Our approach is purely time-domain and is based on studying the controllability properties of the Dirac system. In itself the system is not controllable: the local completeness of states does not hold, but its relevant extension gains controllability. It is the fact, which enables one to apply the boundary control method for solving the inverse problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, inspired by Tsallis' probability distribution based on a $q$-deformed Boltzmann factor, we stipulate a new $q$-deformed quantum dynamics by applying the inverse Wick rotation $ \beta \rightarrow i t$ to the Tsallis-deformed Boltzmann factor. We obtain a new time-dependent $q$-deformed Schr\"odinger equation. The free time-evolution of a Gaussian wave packet and that induced by an harmonic interaction are studied within this $q$-deformed quantum mechanical framework.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Markov property on planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit, in a self contained way, the Markov property on planar maps and decorated planar maps from three perspectives. First, we characterize the laws on these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting invariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps, satisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to those obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the Boltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that halt exploration mid-edge.</description>

      <title>RL-DAUNCE: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Data Assimilation with Uncertainty-Aware Constrained Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation. While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort.</description>

      <title>On a Proof of the ADKMV Conjecture -- $3$-KP Integrability of the Topological Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical proof of the Aganagic-Dijkgraaf-Klemm-Mari\~no-Vafa Conjecture proposed in 2006, which states that the generating function of the topological vertex, i.e., the generating function of the open Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{C}^3$, satisfies the $3$-component KP hierarchy. In our proof we introduce a boson-fermionic field assignment which generalizes the well-known boson-fermion correspondence. The proof also works for the generalization to the framed topological vertex case conjectured by Deng and Zhou. As a consequence, open Gromov-Witten theory of all smooth toric Calabi-Yau threefolds are controlled by the multi-component KP hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>Scaling of highly excited Schr\"odinger-Poisson eigenstates and universality of their rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive numerical characterization of the excited spherically symmetric stationary states of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson problem. Through numerical computation of highly excited eigenstates, novel heuristic laws are proposed, which describe how their fundamental features scale with the excitation index $n$. Key characteristics of the eigenfunctions include: the effective support, which exhibits a parabolic dependence on the excitation index; the distances between adjacent nodes, whose pattern varies regularly with $n$; and the oscillation amplitude, which follows a power law with an exponent approaching $-1$ for large $n$. Based on the eigenfunctions, eigenvelocities are conveniently defined. They exhibit a mid-range oscillatory region with an average linear trend, whose slope approaches zero in the large $n$ limit; and they are characterized by heuristic scaling relationships with the excitation index $n$, revealing an intrinsic universal behavior.</description>

      <title>Quasi-critical fluctuations for 2d directed polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 2d directed polymer in random environment in a novel *quasi-critical regime*, which interpolates between the much studied sub-critical and critical regimes. We prove Edwards-Wilkinson fluctuations throughout the quasi-critical regime, showing that the diffusively rescaled partition functions are asymptotically Gaussian. We deduce a corresponding result for the critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow. A key challenge is the lack of hypercontractivity, which we overcome deriving new moment estimates.</description>

      <title>Martingale Suitable Weak Solutions of $3$-D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Vorticity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct martingale suitable weak solutions for $3$-dimensional incompressible stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with generally non-linear noise. In deterministic setting, as widely known, ``suitable weak solutions'' are Leray-Hopf weak solutions enjoying two different types of local energy inequalities (LEIs). In stochastic setting, we apply the idea of ``martingale solution", avoid transforming to random system, and show new stochastic versions of the two local energy inequalities. In particular, in additive and linear multiplicative noise case, OU-processes and the exponential formulas DO NOT play a role in our formulation of LEIs. This is different to \cite{FR02,Rom10} where the additive noise case is dealt. Also, we successfully apply the concept of ``a.e. super-martingale'' to describe this local energy behavior. To relate the well-known ``dissipative weak solutions" come up with in \cite{DR00}, we derive a local energy equality and extend the concept onto stochastic setting naturally. For further regularity of solutions, we are able to bound the $L^\infty\big([0,T];L^1(\Omega\times\mathbb T^3)\big)$ norm of the vorticity and $L^{\frac{4}{3+\delta}}\big(\Omega\times[0,T]\times\mathbb T^3\big)$ norm of the gradient of the vorticity, in case that the initial vorticity is a finite regular signed measure.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic estimates of large gaps between directions in certain planar quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quasicrystals of cut-and-project type in $\mathbb{R}^d$, it was proved by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson that the limit local statistical properties of the directions to the points in the set are described by certain $\operatorname{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$-invariant point processes. In the present paper we make a detailed study of the tail asymptotics of the limiting gap statistics of the directions, for certain specific classes of planar quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory of random graphs with prescribed degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical field theory methods have been very successful with a number of random graph and random matrix problems, but it is challenging to apply these methods to graphs with prescribed degree sequences due to the extensive number of constraints that enforce the desired degree at each vertex. Building on top of recent results where similar methods are applied to random regular graph counting, we develop an accurate statistical field theory description for the adjacency matrix spectra of graphs with prescribed degrees. For large graphs, the expectation values are dominated by functional saddle points satisfying explicit equations. For the case of regular graphs, this immediately leads to the known McKay distribution. We then consider mixed-regular graphs with N1 vertices of degree d1, N2 vertices of degree d2, etc, such that the ratios N_i/N are kept fixed as N goes to infinity. For such graphs, the eigenvalue densities are governed by nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. Solving these equations numerically reproduces with an excellent accuracy the empirical eigenvalue distributions.</description>

      <title>Conformal Dimensions On Causal Random Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between matter and causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) in the context of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We focus on the Ising model coupled to CDT, contrasting this with Liouville gravity and the relation to the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) formula. We demonstrate analytically for the quenched model that the conformal dimensions of fields on CDT align with those on a fixed lattice. We do this using a combination of lattice methods and adapting the Duplantier-Sheffield framework to CDT, emphasizing the one-dimensional nature of CDT and its description via a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel modification of the original Enskog equation is proposed. The modification is much simpler than that is made in the modified (or revised) Enskog equation proposed by van Beijeren \&amp; Ernst in 1973 and does not require a consideration of many-body configuration. The proposed modification is general enough to be adapted to various equations of states for non-ideal gases. It is shown that the H-theorem can be established for the Enskog and the Enskog--Vlasov equation with the proposed modification.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\be^2 &gt; 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing a physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and establishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative Gaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\be^2 = 2\pi$. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for cone multipliers. Moreover, the probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\be^2 = 6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite surprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold at $\be^2 =8\pi$.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>
