      <title>Hyperfine spectroscopy of optical-cycling transitions in singly ionized thulium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic investigation of $^{169}\mathrm{Tm}^+$ that provides two key foundations for its use as a platform for advanced quantum applications. First, we establish the complete spectroscopic road map for optical cycling (including laser cooling) by performing high-resolution spectroscopy on $^{169}\mathrm{Tm}^+$ ions in an ion trap. We characterize the primary $313\,\mathrm{nm}$ and complementary $448/453\,\mathrm{nm}$ cycling transitions, identify the essential near-infrared repumping frequencies, and determine the magnetic-dipole hyperfine $A$ constants for all relevant levels. Second, we report detailed characterization of a metastable state as a candidate for hosting a robust qubit, performing lifetime measurements and Zeeman-resolved microwave hyperfine spectroscopy with $\mathrm{kHz}$ precision.</description>

      <title>Bound-electron self-energy calculations in Feynman and Coulomb gauges: detailed analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy correction associated with the self-energy diagram is the leading (in magnitude) contribution to the Lamb shift in hydrogen-like ions. All conventional approaches to this correction rely on partial-wave expansions, which are a stumbling block limiting accuracy. To elucidate an issue, we perform a comparative analysis of partial-wave-expansion convergence in two gauges: Feynman and Coulomb. Some tricks for improving convergence are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution optical trapping of multiple cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrays of optical tweezers form the backbone of neutral atoms analog and digital quantum processors. However, the inter-trap distance remains generally much larger than the size of the tweezers to avoid interference-induced trap distortions, limiting the trap density. Here, we report single-atom trapping in four super-resolved tweezers, meaning with a separation below the Sparrow diffraction limit. The optical pattern is generated using superoscillatory phenomenon leading to subwavelength traps with full control of the trap relative phases. We investigate two sets of relative phases that impede or allow the hopping and the reshuffling of atoms. We envision that superoscillatory light structuring will bridge the gap between large-distance traps generated by tweezer arrays and short-distance traps formed with optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Multielectron ionization of three-electron strongly driven Ne at high intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed three-dimensional semiclassical model to study double and triple ionization of Ne driven by infrared laser pulses at various intensities. This model fully accounts for the Coulomb singularity of each electron with the core, as well as for the interaction of a recolliding electron with a bound electron. The model avoids artificial autoionization by employing effective Coulomb potentials to describe the interaction between bound electrons. Using the extended effective-Coulomb-potential for bound-bound electrons (ECBB) model, we compute triple and double ionization spectra. For instance, we compute the distributions of the sum of the final momenta along the laser field of the escaping electrons. Taking focal volume averaging into account, we find very good agreement with experimental results, particularly for triple ionization. Also, we identify the main pathways of triple and double ionization and explain how these pathways give rise to the main features of the triple and double ionization spectra.</description>

      <title>Splitting and connecting singlets in atomic quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of anomalous three-body loss in a population-imbalanced three-component Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.</description>

      <title>Unified laboratory-frame analysis of atomic gravitational-wave sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks usually rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.</description>
