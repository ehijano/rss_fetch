      <title>Deep Transfer $Q$-Learning for Offline Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic decision-making scenarios across business and healthcare, leveraging sample trajectories from diverse populations can significantly enhance reinforcement learning (RL) performance for specific target populations, especially when sample sizes are limited. While existing transfer learning methods primarily focus on linear regression settings, they lack direct applicability to reinforcement learning algorithms. This paper pioneers the study of transfer learning for dynamic decision scenarios modeled by non-stationary finite-horizon Markov decision processes, utilizing neural networks as powerful function approximators and backward inductive learning. We demonstrate that naive sample pooling strategies, effective in regression settings, fail in Markov decision processes.To address this challenge, we introduce a novel ``re-weighted targeting procedure'' to construct ``transferable RL samples'' and propose ``transfer deep $Q^*$-learning'', enabling neural network approximation with theoretical guarantees. We assume that the reward functions are transferable and deal with both situations in which the transition densities are transferable or nontransferable. Our analytical techniques for transfer learning in neural network approximation and transition density transfers have broader implications, extending to supervised transfer learning with neural networks and domain shift scenarios. Empirical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate the advantages of our method, showcasing its potential for improving decision-making through strategically constructing transferable RL samples in non-stationary reinforcement learning contexts.</description>

      <title>RieszBoost: Gradient Boosting for Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering causal questions often involves estimating linear functionals of conditional expectations, such as the average treatment effect or the effect of a longitudinal modified treatment policy. By the Riesz representation theorem, these functionals can be expressed as the expected product of the conditional expectation of the outcome and the Riesz representer, a key component in doubly robust estimation methods. Traditionally, the Riesz representer is estimated indirectly by deriving its explicit analytical form, estimating its components, and substituting these estimates into the known form (e.g., the inverse propensity score). However, deriving or estimating the analytical form can be challenging, and substitution methods are often sensitive to practical positivity violations, leading to higher variance and wider confidence intervals. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient boosting algorithm to directly estimate the Riesz representer without requiring its explicit analytical form. This method is particularly suited for tabular data, offering a flexible, nonparametric, and computationally efficient alternative to existing methods for Riesz regression. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our algorithm performs on par with or better than indirect estimation techniques across a range of functionals, providing a user-friendly and robust solution for estimating causal quantities.</description>

      <title>Optimality and Adaptivity of Deep Neural Features for Instrumental Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a convergence analysis of deep feature instrumental variable (DFIV) regression (Xu et al., 2021), a nonparametric approach to IV regression using data-adaptive features learned by deep neural networks in two stages. We prove that the DFIV algorithm achieves the minimax optimal learning rate when the target structural function lies in a Besov space. This is shown under standard nonparametric IV assumptions, and an additional smoothness assumption on the regularity of the conditional distribution of the covariate given the instrument, which controls the difficulty of Stage 1. We further demonstrate that DFIV, as a data-adaptive algorithm, is superior to fixed-feature (kernel or sieve) IV methods in two ways. First, when the target function possesses low spatial homogeneity (i.e., it has both smooth and spiky/discontinuous regions), DFIV still achieves the optimal rate, while fixed-feature methods are shown to be strictly suboptimal. Second, comparing with kernel-based two-stage regression estimators, DFIV is provably more data efficient in the Stage 1 samples.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding the bias in decision trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a widespread and longstanding belief that machine learning models are biased towards the majority (or negative) class when learning from imbalanced data, leading them to neglect or ignore the minority (or positive) class. In this study, we show that this belief is not necessarily correct for decision trees, and that their bias can actually be in the opposite direction. Motivated by a recent simulation study that suggested that decision trees can be biased towards the minority class, our paper aims to reconcile the conflict between that study and decades of other works. First, we critically evaluate past literature on this problem, finding that failing to consider the data generating process has led to incorrect conclusions about the bias in decision trees. We then prove that, under specific conditions related to the predictors, decision trees fit to purity and trained on a dataset with only one positive case are biased towards the minority class. Finally, we demonstrate that splits in a decision tree are also biased when there is more than one positive case. Our findings have implications on the use of popular tree-based models, such as random forests.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic analysis of the performance of the penalized least trimmed squares in sparse models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The least trimmed squares (LTS) estimator is a renowned robust alternative to the classic least squares estimator and is popular in location, regression, machine learning, and AI literature. Many studies exist on LTS, including its robustness, computation algorithms, extension to non-linear cases, asymptotics, etc. The LTS has been applied in the penalized regression in a high-dimensional real-data sparse-model setting where dimension $p$ (in thousands) is much larger than sample size $n$ (in tens, or hundreds). In such a practical setting, the sample size $n$ often is the count of sub-population that has a special attribute (e.g. the count of patients of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Leukemia, or ALS, etc.) among a population with a finite fixed size N. Asymptotic analysis assuming that $n$ tends to infinity is not practically convincing and legitimate in such a scenario. A non-asymptotic or finite sample analysis will be more desirable and feasible.
  This article establishes some finite sample (non-asymptotic) error bounds for estimating and predicting based on LTS with high probability for the first time.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning with Evolving Tasks and Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple supervised learning scenarios are composed by a sequence of classification tasks. For instance, multi-task learning and continual learning aim to learn a sequence of tasks that is either fixed or grows over time. Existing techniques for learning tasks that are in a sequence are tailored to specific scenarios, lacking adaptability to others. In addition, most of existing techniques consider situations in which the order of the tasks in the sequence is not relevant. However, it is common that tasks in a sequence are evolving in the sense that consecutive tasks often have a higher similarity. This paper presents a learning methodology that is applicable to multiple supervised learning scenarios and adapts to evolving tasks. Differently from existing techniques, we provide computable tight performance guarantees and analytically characterize the increase in the effective sample size. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the performance improvement of the proposed methodology in multiple scenarios and the reliability of the presented performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Robust Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposed in Hyv\"arinen (2005), score matching is a parameter estimation procedure that does not require computation of distributional normalizing constants. In this work we utilize the geometric median of means to develop a robust score matching procedure that yields consistent parameter estimates in settings where the observed data has been contaminated. A special appeal of the proposed method is that it retains convexity in exponential family models. The new method is therefore particularly attractive for non-Gaussian, exponential family graphical models where evaluation of normalizing constants is intractable. Support recovery guarantees for such models when contamination is present are provided. Additionally, support recovery is studied in numerical experiments and on a precipitation dataset. We demonstrate that the proposed robust score matching estimator performs comparably to the standard score matching estimator when no contamination is present but greatly outperforms this estimator in a setting with contamination.</description>

      <title>Causal Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Personalised Treatment Effects -- Insights on validity from two large trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal machine learning (ML) methods hold great promise for advancing precision medicine by estimating personalized treatment effects. However, their reliability remains largely unvalidated in empirical settings. In this study, we assessed the internal and external validity of 17 mainstream causal heterogeneity ML methods -- including metalearners, tree-based methods, and deep learning methods -- using data from two large randomized controlled trials: the International Stroke Trial (N=19,435) and the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (N=21,106). Our findings reveal that none of the ML methods reliably validated their performance, neither internal nor external, showing significant discrepancies between training and test data on the proposed evaluation metrics. The individualized treatment effects estimated from training data failed to generalize to the test data, even in the absence of distribution shifts. These results raise concerns about the current applicability of causal ML models in precision medicine, and highlight the need for more robust validation techniques to ensure generalizability.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Skip Connections for Deterministic Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic uncertainty quantification (UQ) in deep learning aims to estimate uncertainty with a single pass through a network by leveraging outputs from the network's feature extractor. Existing methods require that the feature extractor be both sensitive and smooth, ensuring meaningful input changes produce meaningful changes in feature vectors. Smoothness enables generalization, while sensitivity prevents feature collapse, where distinct inputs are mapped to identical feature vectors. To meet these requirements, current deterministic methods often retrain networks with spectral normalization. Instead of modifying training, we propose using measures of neural collapse to identify an existing intermediate layer that is both sensitive and smooth. We then fit a probabilistic model to the feature vector of this intermediate layer, which we call a probabilistic skip connection (PSC). Through empirical analysis, we explore the impact of spectral normalization on neural collapse and demonstrate that PSCs can effectively disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Additionally, we show that PSCs achieve uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance that matches or exceeds existing single-pass methods requiring training modifications. By retrofitting existing models, PSCs enable high-quality UQ and OOD capabilities without retraining.</description>

      <title>Reach Measurement, Optimization and Frequency Capping In Targeted Online Advertising Under k-Anonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth in the use of online advertising to foster brand awareness over recent years is largely attributable to the ubiquity of social media. One pivotal technology contributing to the success of online brand advertising is frequency capping, a mechanism that enables marketers to control the number of times an ad is shown to a specific user. However, the very foundation of this technology is being scrutinized as the industry gravitates towards advertising solutions that prioritize user privacy. This paper delves into the issue of reach measurement and optimization within the context of $k$-anonymity, a privacy-preserving model gaining traction across major online advertising platforms. We outline how to report reach within this new privacy landscape and demonstrate how probabilistic discounting, a probabilistic adaptation of traditional frequency capping, can be employed to optimize campaign performance. Experiments are performed to assess the trade-off between user privacy and the efficacy of online brand advertising. Notably, we discern a significant dip in performance as long as privacy is introduced, yet this comes with a limited additional cost for advertising platforms to offer their users more privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning convolution operators associated to compact Abelian groups. We study a regularization-based approach and provide corresponding learning guarantees, discussing natural regularity condition on the convolution kernel. More precisely, we assume the convolution kernel is a function in a translation invariant Hilbert space and analyze a natural ridge regression (RR) estimator. Building on existing results for RR, we characterize the accuracy of the estimator in terms of finite sample bounds. Interestingly, regularity assumptions which are classical in the analysis of RR, have a novel and natural interpretation in terms of space/frequency localization. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Diffusion Models via Speculative Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative sampling is a popular technique for accelerating inference in Large Language Models by generating candidate tokens using a fast draft model and accepting or rejecting them based on the target model's distribution. While speculative sampling was previously limited to discrete sequences, we extend it to diffusion models, which generate samples via continuous, vector-valued Markov chains. In this context, the target model is a high-quality but computationally expensive diffusion model. We propose various drafting strategies, including a simple and effective approach that does not require training a draft model and is applicable out of the box to any diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate significant generation speedup on various diffusion models, halving the number of function evaluations, while generating exact samples from the target model.</description>

      <title>Entangled Mean Estimation in High-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of high-dimensional entangled mean estimation in the subset-of-signals model. Specifically, given $N$ independent random points $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ in $\mathbb{R}^D$ and a parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ such that each $x_i$ is drawn from a Gaussian with mean $\mu$ and unknown covariance, and an unknown $\alpha$-fraction of the points have identity-bounded covariances, the goal is to estimate the common mean $\mu$. The one-dimensional version of this task has received significant attention in theoretical computer science and statistics over the past decades. Recent work [LY20; CV24] has given near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the one-dimensional setting. On the other hand, our understanding of even the information-theoretic aspects of the multivariate setting has remained limited.
  In this work, we design a computationally efficient algorithm achieving an information-theoretically near-optimal error. Specifically, we show that the optimal error (up to polylogarithmic factors) is $f(\alpha,N) + \sqrt{D/(\alpha N)}$, where the term $f(\alpha,N)$ is the error of the one-dimensional problem and the second term is the sub-Gaussian error rate. Our algorithmic approach employs an iterative refinement strategy, whereby we progressively learn more accurate approximations $\hat \mu$ to $\mu$. This is achieved via a novel rejection sampling procedure that removes points significantly deviating from $\hat \mu$, as an attempt to filter out unusually noisy samples. A complication that arises is that rejection sampling introduces bias in the distribution of the remaining points. To address this issue, we perform a careful analysis of the bias, develop an iterative dimension-reduction strategy, and employ a novel subroutine inspired by list-decodable learning that leverages the one-dimensional result.</description>

      <title>A New Transformation Approach for Uplift Modeling with Binary Outcome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uplift modeling has been used effectively in fields such as marketing and customer retention, to target those customers who are more likely to respond due to the campaign or treatment. Essentially, it is a machine learning technique that predicts the gain from performing some action with respect to not taking it. A popular class of uplift models is the transformation approach that redefines the target variable with the original treatment indicator. These transformation approaches only need to train and predict the difference in outcomes directly. The main drawback of these approaches is that in general it does not use the information in the treatment indicator beyond the construction of the transformed outcome and usually is not efficient. In this paper, we design a novel transformed outcome for the case of the binary target variable and unlock the full value of the samples with zero outcome. From a practical perspective, our new approach is flexible and easy to use. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets obviously show that our new approach outperforms the traditional one. At present, our new approach has already been applied to precision marketing in a China nation-wide financial holdings group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel capacity measure 2sED for statistical models based on the effective dimension. The new quantity provably bounds the generalization error under mild assumptions on the model. Furthermore, simulations on standard data sets and popular model architectures show that 2sED correlates well with the training error. For Markovian models, we show how to efficiently approximate 2sED from below through a layerwise iterative approach, which allows us to tackle deep learning models with a large number of parameters.

      <title>Bayesian Joint Additive Factor Models for Multiview Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is increasingly common in a wide variety of applied settings to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors. Our open-source software (R package) is available at https://github.com/niccoloanceschi/jafar.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Neural Network Symmetrisation in Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Behavior of Black-Box Prediction Algorithms with Causal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.02482v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal approaches to post-hoc explainability for black-box prediction models (e.g., deep neural networks trained on image pixel data) have become increasingly popular. However, existing approaches have two important shortcomings: (i) the "explanatory units" are micro-level inputs into the relevant prediction model, e.g., image pixels, rather than interpretable macro-level features that are more useful for understanding how to possibly change the algorithm's behavior, and (ii) existing approaches assume there exists no unmeasured confounding between features and target model predictions, which fails to hold when the explanatory units are macro-level variables. Our focus is on the important setting where the analyst has no access to the inner workings of the target prediction algorithm, rather only the ability to query the output of the model in response to a particular input. To provide causal explanations in such a setting, we propose to learn causal graphical representations that allow for arbitrary unmeasured confounding among features. We demonstrate the resulting graph can differentiate between interpretable features that causally influence model predictions versus those that are merely associated with model predictions due to confounding. Our approach is motivated by a counterfactual theory of causal explanation wherein good explanations point to factors that are "difference-makers" in an interventionist sense.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Message-Passing Architectures for Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the node classification problem on feature-decorated graphs in the sparse setting, i.e., when the expected degree of a node is $O(1)$ in the number of nodes, in the fixed-dimensional asymptotic regime, i.e., the dimension of the feature data is fixed while the number of nodes is large. Such graphs are typically known to be locally tree-like. We introduce a notion of Bayes optimality for node classification tasks, called asymptotic local Bayes optimality, and compute the optimal classifier according to this criterion for a fairly general statistical data model with arbitrary distributions of the node features and edge connectivity. The optimal classifier is implementable using a message-passing graph neural network architecture. We then compute the generalization error of this classifier and compare its performance against existing learning methods theoretically on a well-studied statistical model with naturally identifiable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the data. We find that the optimal message-passing architecture interpolates between a standard MLP in the regime of low graph signal and a typical convolution in the regime of high graph signal. Furthermore, we prove a corresponding non-asymptotic result.</description>

      <title>Causal Machine Learning for Moderation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is valuable for any decision maker to know the impact of decisions (treatments) on average and for subgroups. The causal machine learning literature has recently provided tools for estimating group average treatment effects (GATE) to better describe treatment heterogeneity. This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting such differences in treatment effects between groups while accounting for variations in other covariates. We propose a new parameter, the balanced group average treatment effect (BGATE), which measures a GATE with a specific distribution of a priori-determined covariates. By taking the difference between two BGATEs, we can analyze heterogeneity more meaningfully than by comparing two GATEs, as we can separate the difference due to the different distributions of other variables and the difference due to the variable of interest. The main estimation strategy for this parameter is based on double/debiased machine learning for discrete treatments in an unconfoundedness setting, and the estimator is shown to be $\sqrt{N}$-consistent and asymptotically normal under standard conditions. We propose two additional estimation strategies: automatic debiased machine learning and a specific reweighting procedure. Last, we demonstrate the usefulness of these parameters in a small-scale simulation study and in an empirical example.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Clustering and Distribution Matching with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for clustering and distribution matching problems with bandit feedback. We consider a $K$-armed bandit model where some subset of $K$ arms is partitioned into $M$ groups. Within each group, the random variable associated to each arm follows the same distribution on a finite alphabet. At each time step, the decision maker pulls an arm and observes its outcome from the random variable associated to that arm. Subsequent arm pulls depend on the history of arm pulls and their outcomes. The decision maker has no knowledge of the distributions of the arms or the underlying partitions. The task is to devise an online algorithm to learn the underlying partition of arms with the least number of arm pulls on average and with an error probability not exceeding a pre-determined value~$\delta$. Several existing problems fall under our general framework, including finding $M$ pairs of arms, odd arm identification, and $N$-ary clustering of $K$ arms belong to our general framework. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the average number of arm pulls for any online algorithm with an error probability not exceeding $\delta$. Furthermore, we develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop method and Frank--Wolfe algorithm, and show that the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm asymptotically matches that of the lower bound. Our refined analysis also uncovers a novel bound on the speed at which the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm converges to the fundamental limit as $\delta$ vanishes.</description>

      <title>Most Influential Subset Selection: Challenges, Promises, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we attribute the behaviors of machine learning models to their training data? While the classic influence function sheds light on the impact of individual samples, it often fails to capture the more complex and pronounced collective influence of a set of samples. To tackle this challenge, we study the Most Influential Subset Selection (MISS) problem, which aims to identify a subset of training samples with the greatest collective influence. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prevailing approaches in MISS, elucidating their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings reveal that influence-based greedy heuristics, a dominant class of algorithms in MISS, can provably fail even in linear regression. We delineate the failure modes, including the errors of influence function and the non-additive structure of the collective influence. Conversely, we demonstrate that an adaptive version of these heuristics which applies them iteratively, can effectively capture the interactions among samples and thus partially address the issues. Experiments on real-world datasets corroborate these theoretical findings and further demonstrate that the merit of adaptivity can extend to more complex scenarios such as classification tasks and non-linear neural networks. We conclude our analysis by emphasizing the inherent trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, questioning the use of additive metrics such as the Linear Datamodeling Score, and offering a range of discussions.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private Online Federated Learning With Correlated Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a locally differentially private (LDP) algorithm for online federated learning that employs temporally correlated noise to improve utility while preserving privacy. To address challenges posed by the correlated noise and local updates with streaming non-IID data, we develop a perturbed iterate analysis that controls the impact of the noise on the utility. Moreover, we demonstrate how the drift errors from local updates can be effectively managed for several classes of nonconvex loss functions. Subject to an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP budget, we establish a dynamic regret bound that quantifies the impact of key parameters and the intensity of changes in the dynamic environment on the learning performance. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>
