      <title>Closed-form solutions for the Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose integral representations and analytical solutions for the propagator of the $1+1$ dimensional Salpeter Hamiltonian, describing a relativistic quantum particle with no spin. We explore the exact Green function and an exact solution for a given initial condition, and also find the asymptotic solutions in some limiting cases. The analytical extension of the Hamiltonian in the complex plane allows us to formulate the equivalent stochastic problem, namely the B\"aumer equation. This equation describes \textit{relativistic} stochastic processes with time-changing anomalous diffusion. This B\"aumer propagator corresponds to the Green function of a relativistic diffusion process that interpolates between Cauchy distributions for small times and Gaussian diffusion for large times, providing a framework for stochastic processes where anomalous diffusion is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>Quantum key distribution rates from non-symmetric conic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing key rates in QKD numerically is essential to unlock more powerful protocols, that use more sophisticated measurement bases or quantum systems of higher dimension. It is a difficult optimization problem, that depends on minimizing a convex non-linear function: the relative entropy. Standard conic optimization techniques have for a long time been unable to handle the relative entropy cone, as it is a non-symmetric cone, and the standard algorithms can only handle symmetric ones. Recently, however, a practical algorithm has been discovered for optimizing over non-symmetric cones, including the relative entropy. Here we adapt this algorithm to the problem of computation of key rates, obtaining an efficient technique for lower bounding them. In comparison to previous techniques it has the advantages of flexibility, ease of use, and above all performance.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for 1-matric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time and the Time-Dilation induced Interaction Transfer mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bipartite quantum system in an energy eigenstate, the dynamical description for one component can be derived via entanglement using the other component as a clock. This is the essence of the Page and Wootters mechanism. Moreover, if the clock is subject to a gravitational-like interaction, relative time evolution is then described by a Time-Dilated Schr\"odinger equation, in which the so-called Redshift Operator describes a purely quantum effect, analogue to gravitational time-dilation. Here we adopt a non-perturbative approach and present a finite-dimensional generalisation of this mechanism, expressing the quantum time-dilation effect as an effective interaction involving previously non-interacting system components. We name this a Time-Dilation induced Interaction Transfer (TiDIT) mechanism and discuss an example using two coupled spins as a quantum clock model. Our approach is suitable for implementations in current quantum technology and provides a new tool for exploring gravity at the intersection with quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resource theory imposes a preorder over states, with one state being above another if the first can be converted to the second by a free operation, and where the set of free operations defines the notion of resourcefulness under study. In general, the location of a state in the preorder of one resource theory can constrain its location in the preorder of a different resource theory. It follows that there can be nontrivial dependence relations between different notions of resourcefulness. In this article, we lay out the conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations. In particular, we note that the relations holding among a set of monotones that includes a complete set for each resource theory provides a full characterization of resource dependence relations. As an example, we consider three resource theories concerning the about-face asymmetry properties of a qubit along three mutually orthogonal axes on the Bloch ball, where about-face symmetry refers to a representation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, consisting of the identity map and a $\pi$ rotation about the given axis. This example is sufficiently simple that we are able to derive a complete set of monotones for each resource theory and to determine all of the relations that hold among these monotones, thereby completely solving the problem of determining resource dependence relations. Nonetheless, we show that even in this simplest of examples, these relations are already quite nuanced.</description>

      <title>Long-range interactions revealed by collective spin noise spectra in atomic vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report anomalous features in the spin noise spectroscopy (SNS) of a thin cell of a dense vapor of alkali atoms. At high densities and close to resonance, we observe a dramatic broadening of the spin noise spectra as well as an unexpected extra low-frequency noise component. With the help of a two-body model and simulations, we show that these features are the hallmark of a strong, long-range dipole-dipole interaction within the ensemble. The additional low-frequency noise reveals the correlated evolution of pair of atoms beyond the impact approximation. In this regime, we demonstrate that spin noise can no longer be obtained from one-body dynamics, opening the way for the characterization of many-body spin noise, atomic entanglement or higher order spin correlators in atomic vapors using SNS.</description>

      <title>Effects of resonant dipole-dipole interactions in the spin noise of atomic vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform spin noise spectroscopy close to resonance in a 1-mm-thick cell containing a dense Rubidium vapor. A laser is used to excite optical dipoles in the vapor while probing the Faraday rotation noise. We report unusual lineshapes of the spin noise spectra with a strong density dependence, which we attribute to interactions arising between particles in the system. Introducing a two-body model and simulations, we show that these features are the hallmark of a strong dipole-dipole interaction between binaries within the ensemble. A precise fit of the experimental spectra allows to extract the strength and the duration of the dipole-dipole interaction. We unveil its impact on the spin noise frequency and investigate the role of the atomic motion in the unexpected lineshapes. This work demonstrates the potential of spin noise spectroscopy to observe and quantify strong interactions occurring within a particle ensemble.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Structure in Quantum Relative Entropy Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy programs are convex optimization problems which minimize a linear functional over an affine section of the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy function. Recently, the self-concordance of a natural barrier function was proved for this set. This has opened up the opportunity to use interior-point methods for nonsymmetric cone programs to solve these optimization problems. In this paper, we show how common structures arising from applications in quantum information theory can be exploited to improve the efficiency of solving quantum relative entropy programs using interior-point methods. First, we show that the natural barrier function for the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy composed with positive linear operators is optimally self-concordant, even when these linear operators map to singular matrices. Second, we show how we can exploit a catalogue of common structures in these linear operators to compute the inverse Hessian products of the barrier function more efficiently. This step is typically the bottleneck when solving quantum relative entropy programs using interior-point methods, and therefore improving the efficiency of this step can significantly improve the computational performance of the algorithm. We demonstrate how these methods can be applied to important applications in quantum information theory, including quantum key distribution, quantum rate-distortion, quantum channel capacities, and estimating the ground state energy of Hamiltonians. Our numerical results show that these techniques improve computation times by up to several orders of magnitude, and allow previously intractable problems to be solved.</description>

      <title>Efficient state preparation for the quantum simulation of molecules in first quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum simulation of real molecules and materials is one of the most highly anticipated applications of quantum computing. Algorithms for simulating electronic structure using a first-quantized plane wave representation are especially promising due to their asymptotic efficiency. However, previous proposals for preparing initial states for these simulation algorithms scale poorly with the size of the basis set. We address this shortcoming by showing how to efficiently map states defined in a Gaussian type orbital basis to a plane wave basis with a scaling that is logarithmic in the number of plane waves. Our key technical result is a proof that molecular orbitals constructed from Gaussian type basis functions can be compactly represented in a plane wave basis using matrix product states. While we expect that other approaches could achieve the same logarithmic scaling with respect to basis set size, our proposed state preparation technique is also highly efficient in practice. For example, in a series of numerical experiments on small molecules, we find that our approach allows us to prepare an approximation to the Hartree-Fock state using orders of magnitude fewer non-Clifford gates than a naive approach. By resolving the issue of state preparation, our work allows for the first quantum simulation of molecular systems whose end-to-end complexity is truly sublinear in the basis set size.</description>

      <title>Adiabatons in a double tripod coherent atom-light coupling scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>

      <title>Krenn-Gu conjecture for sparse graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are quantum states involving at least three entangled particles. They are of fundamental interest in quantum information theory, and the construction of such states of high dimension has various applications in quantum communication and cryptography. They are of fundamental interest in quantum information theory, and the construction of such states of high dimension has various applications in quantum communication and cryptography. Krenn, Gu and Zeilinger discovered a correspondence between a large class of quantum optical experiments which produce GHZ states and edge-weighted edge-coloured multi-graphs with some special properties called the \emph{GHZ graphs}. On such GHZ graphs, a graph parameter called \emph{dimension} can be defined, which is the same as the dimension of the GHZ state produced by the corresponding experiment. Krenn and Gu conjectured that the dimension of any GHZ graph with more than $4$ vertices is at most $2$. An affirmative resolution of the Krenn-Gu conjecture has implications for quantum resource theory. On the other hand, the construction of a GHZ graph on a large number of vertices with a high dimension would lead to breakthrough results.
  In this paper, we study the existence of GHZ graphs from the perspective of the Krenn-Gu conjecture and show that the conjecture is true for graphs of vertex connectivity at most 2 and for cubic graphs. We also show that the minimal counterexample to the conjecture should be $4$-connected. Such information could be of great help in the search for GHZ graphs using existing tools like PyTheus. While the impact of the work is in quantum physics, the techniques in this paper are purely combinatorial, and no background in quantum physics is required to understand them.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros in Quantum Phase Transition: An Entanglement Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Yang-Lee theory to quantum phase transitions to show how singularity enters the phase transition points in one-dimensional many-body systems. We primarily focus on the distribution of Yang-Lee zeros and its associated Yang-Lee edge singularity of two prototypical models: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the XXZ spin chain. By taking the zero-temperature limit, we show how the Yang-Lee zeros approach the quantum phase transition points on the complex plane of parameters. To characterize the edge singularity induced by Yang-Lee zeros in quantum phase transition, we introduce the entanglement entropy of the ground state to show the edges of Yang-Lee zeros lead to the entanglement transition. We further show our results are also applicable to the general non-interacting parity-time-symmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Photon routing in disordered chiral waveguide QED ladders: Interplay between photonic localization and collective atomic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, photon routing has garnered considerable research activity due to its key applications in quantum networking and optical communications. This paper studies the single photon routing scheme in many-emitter disordered chiral waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) ladders. The wQED ladder consists of two one-dimensional lossless waveguides simultaneously and chirally coupled with a chain of dipole-dipole interacting two-level quantum emitters (QEs) or atoms. In particular, we analyze how a departure from the periodic placement of the QEs due to temperature-induced position disorder can impact the routing probability. This involves analyzing how the interplay between the collective atomic effects originating from the dipole-dipole interaction and disorder in the atomic location leading to single-photon localization can change the routing probabilities. As for some key results, we find that the routing probability exhibits a considerable improvement (more than $90\%$ value) for periodic and disordered wQED ladders when considering lattices consisting of twenty QEs. This robustness of collective effects against spontaneous emission loss and weak disorders is further confirmed by examining the routing efficiency and localization length for up to twenty QE chains. These results may find applications in quantum networking and distributed quantum computing under the realistic conditions of imperfect emitter trappings.</description>

      <title>qLUE: A Quantum Clustering Algorithm for Multi- Dimensional Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are at the basis of several technological applications, and are fueling the development of rapidly evolving fields such as machine learning. In the recent past, however, it has become apparent that they face challenges stemming from datasets that span more spatial dimensions. In fact, the best-performing clustering algorithms scale linearly in the number of points, but quadratically with respect to the local density of points. In this work, we introduce qLUE, a quantum clustering algorithm that scales linearly in both the number of points and their density. qLUE is inspired by CLUE, an algorithm developed to address the challenging time and memory budgets of Event Reconstruction (ER) in future High-Energy Physics experiments. As such, qLUE marries decades of development with the quadratic speedup provided by quantum computers. We numerically test qLUE in several scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness and proving it to be a promising route to handle complex data analysis tasks -- especially in high-dimensional datasets with high densities of points.</description>

      <title>Goos-H{\"a}nchen Shift for Relativistic Particles Based on Dirac's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goos-H{\"a}nchen (GH) shift is a specifical optical phenomenon that describes a shift parallel to the reflected light inside the plane of incidence, when a finite-width light undergoes total internal reflection at the interface of medium. Although the GH shift in optics has been widely observed experimentally, its generalization remains uncovered completely in relativistic quantum mechanics for the existence of Klein's paradox. Recently, Wang has solved Klein's paradox based on the different solutions adpoted for Dirac's equation with step potential in corresponding energy regions \href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2399-6528/abd340}{[J. Phys. Commun. {\bf 4}, 125010 (2020)]}. In the light of Wang's method, we calculate the GH shift for Dirac fermions under relativistic conditions when they are incident obliquely on a three-dimensional infinite potential barrier. Furthermore, we find that the relativistic quantum GH shift can be negative, which is different from the non-relativistic case.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network for quantum control of NMR registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical and quantum machine learning are being increasingly applied to various tasks in quantum information technologies. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of quantum control using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). PINN's salient feature is how it encodes the entire control sequence in terms of its network parameters. This feature enables the control sequence to be later adopted to any hardware with optimal time discretization, which contrasts with conventional methods involving a priory time discretization. Here, we discuss two important quantum information tasks: gate synthesis and state preparation. First, we demonstrate quantum gate synthesis by designing a two-qubit CNOT gate and experimentally implementing it on a heteronuclear two-spin NMR register. Second, we demonstrate quantum state preparation by designing a control sequence to efficiently transfer the thermal state into the long-lived singlet state and experimentally implement it on a homonuclear two-spin NMR register. We present a detailed numerical analysis of the PINN control sequences regarding bandwidth, discretization levels, control field errors, and external noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir computing using the stabilizer formalism for encoding classical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a quantum system for reservoir computing has recently received a lot of attention. Key challenges are related to how on can optimally en- and decode classical information, as well as what constitutes a good reservoir. Our main contribution is a generalization of the standard way to robustly en- and decode time series into subspaces defined by the cosets of a given stabilizer. A key observation is the necessity to perform the decoding step, which in turn ensures a consistent way of encoding. This provides a systematic way to encode classical information in a robust way. We provide a numerical analysis on a discrete time series given by two standard maps, namely the logistic and the H\'enon map. Our numerical findings indicate that the system's performance is increasing with the length of the training data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Clustering for Preparing a Prior Distribution of Eigenspectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the energy gap in a quantum many-body system is critical to understanding its behavior and is important in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. The challenge of determining the energy gap requires identifying both the excited and ground states of a system. In this work, we consider preparing the prior distribution and circuits for the eigenspectrum of time-independent Hamiltonians, which can benefit both classical and quantum algorithms for solving eigenvalue problems. The proposed algorithm unfolds in three strategic steps: Hamiltonian transformation, parameter representation, and classical clustering. These steps are underpinned by two key insights: the use of quantum circuits to approximate the ground state of transformed Hamiltonians and the analysis of parameter representation to distinguish between eigenvectors. The algorithm is showcased through applications to the 1D Heisenberg system and the LiH molecular system, highlighting its potential for both near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant quantum devices. The paper also explores the scalability of the method and its performance across various settings, setting the stage for more resource-efficient quantum computations that are both accurate and fast. The findings presented here mark a new insight into hybrid algorithms, offering a pathway to overcoming current computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Reducing Quantum Error Correction Overhead with Versatile Flag-Sharing Syndrome Extraction Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that quantum error correction processes are unreliable, an efficient error syndrome extraction circuit should use fewer ancillary qubits, quantum gates, and measurements, while maintaining low circuit depth, to minimizing the circuit area, roughly defined as the product of circuit depth and the number of physical qubits. We propose to design parallel flagged syndrome extraction with shared flag qubits for quantum stabilizer codes. Versatile parallelization techniques are employed to minimize the required circuit area, thereby improving the error threshold and overall performance. Specifically, all the measurement outcomes in multiple rounds of syndrome extraction are integrated into a lookup table decoder, allowing us to parallelize multiple stabilizer measurements with shared flag qubits. We present flag-sharing and fully parallel schemes for the [[17,1,5]] and [[19,1,5]] Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. This methodology extends to the [[5,1,3]] non-CSS code, achieving the minimum known circuit area. Numerical simulations have demonstrated improved pseudothresholds for these codes by up to an order of magnitude compared to previous schemes in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Transfer via a Multimode Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computation needs rapid quantum communication to network qubits fabricated on different chips and long-range couplers to implement efficient quantum error-correction codes. Quantum channels used for these purposes are best modeled by multimode resonators, which lie between single-mode cavities and waveguides with a continuum of modes. In this Letter, we propose a formalism for quantum state transfer using coupling strengths comparable to the channel's free spectral range ($g\sim\Delta_{\text{fsr}}$). Our scheme merges features of both the STIRAP-based methods for single-model cavities and the pitch-and-catch protocol for long waveguides, integrating their advantage of low loss and high speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors represent a new generation of sensors with improved precision, accuracy, stability, and robustness to environmental effects compared to their classical predecessors. After decades of laboratory development, several types of quantum sensors are now commercially available or are part-way through the commercialization process. This article provides a brief description of the operation of a selection of quantum sensors that employ the principles of atom-light interactions and discusses progress toward packaging those sensors into products. This article covers quantum inertial and gravitational sensors, including gyroscopes, accelerometers, gravimeters, and gravity gradiometers that employ atom interferometry, nuclear magnetic resonance gyroscopes, atomic and spin-defect magnetometers, and Rydberg electric field sensors.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian generalized two-mode squeezing: applications to two-ensemble spin squeezing and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled Gaussian states that have wide utility in quantum information and metrology. Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient inference of quantum system parameters by Approximate Bayesian Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently infer system parameters is essential in any signal-processing task that requires fast operation. Dealing with quantum systems, a serious challenge arises due to substantial growth of the underlying Hilbert space with the system size. As the statistics of the measurement data observed, i.e. the likelihood, can no longer be easily computed, common approaches such as maximum-likelihood estimators or particle filters become impractical. To address this issue, we propose the use of the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm, which evades likelihood computation by sampling from a library of measurement data - a priori prepared for a given quantum device. We apply ABC to interpret photodetection click-patterns arising when probing in real time a two-level atom and an optomechanical system. For the latter, we consider both linear and non-linear regimes, in order to show how to tailor the ABC algorithm by understanding the quantum measurement statistics. Our work demonstrates that fast parameter inference may be possible no matter the complexity of a quantum device and the measurement scheme involved.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Synthesis and Compilation Optimization: Overview and Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is regarded as a promising paradigm that may overcome the current computational power bottlenecks in the post-Moore era. The increasing maturity of quantum processors, especially superconducting ones, provides more possibilities for the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. As the crucial stages for quantum algorithm implementation, the logic circuit design and quantum compiling have also received significant attention, which covers key technologies such as quantum logic circuit synthesis (also widely known as quantum architecture search) and optimization, as well as qubit mapping and routing. Recent studies suggest that the scale and precision of related algorithms are steadily increasing, especially with the integration of artificial intelligence methods. In this survey, we systematically review and summarize a vast body of literature, exploring the feasibility of an integrated design and optimization scheme that spans from the algorithmic level to quantum hardware, combining the steps of logic circuit design and compilation optimization. Leveraging the exceptional cognitive and learning capabilities of AI algorithms, one can reduce manual design costs, enhance the precision and efficiency of execution, and facilitate the implementation and validation of the superiority of quantum algorithms on hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise induced nonreciprocity for single photon transport in parity-time symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computational Superiority boasts rapid computation and high energy efficiency. Despite recent advances in classical algorithms aimed at refuting the milestone claim of Google's sycamore, challenges remain in generating uncorrelated samples of random quantum circuits. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking large-scale system technology that leverages optimization on global, node, and device levels to achieve unprecedented scalability for tensor networks. This enables the handling of large-scale tensor networks with memory capacities reaching tens of terabytes, surpassing memory space constraints on a single node. Our techniques enable accommodating large-scale tensor networks with up to tens of terabytes of memory, reaching up to 2304 GPUs with a peak computing power of 561 PFLOPS half-precision. Notably, we have achieved a time-to-solution of 14.22 seconds with energy consumption of 2.39 kWh which achieved fidelity of 0.002 and our most remarkable result is a time-to-solution of 17.18 seconds, with energy consumption of only 0.29 kWh which achieved a XEB of 0.002 after post-processing, outperforming Google's quantum processor Sycamore in both speed and energy efficiency, which recorded 600 seconds and 4.3 kWh, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we use cross-domain classification using quantum machine learning for quantum advantages to address the entanglement versus separability paradigm. We further demonstrate the efficient classification of Bell diagonal states into zero and non-zero discord classes. The inherited structure of quantum states and its relation with a particular class of quantum states are exploited to intuitively approach the classification of different domain testing states, referred here as crossdomain classification. In addition, we extend our analysis to evaluate the robustness of our model for the analyzed problem using random unitary transformations. Using numerical analysis, our results clearly demonstrate the potential of QSVM for classifying quantum states across the multidimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Realizing a Compact, High-Fidelity, Telecom-Wavelength Source of Multipartite Entangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entangled states are an essential building block for advanced quantum networking applications. Realizing such tasks in practice puts stringent requirements on the characteristics of the states in terms of fidelity and generation rate, along with a desired compatibility with telecommunication network deployment. Here, we demonstrate a photonic platform design capable of producing high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, at telecom wavelength and in a compact and scalable configuration. Our source relies on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a layered Sagnac interferometer, which only requires a single nonlinear crystal. This enables the generation of highly indistinguishable photon pairs, leading by entanglement fusion to four-qubit polarization-entangled GHZ states with fidelity up to $(94.73 \pm 0.21)\%$ with respect to the ideal state, at a rate of 1.7Hz. We provide a complete characterization of our source and highlight its suitability for practical quantum network applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computing across an Optical Network Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising on performance and connectivity. Photonic networks are well-suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity via quantum gate teleportation (QGT). For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, there has been no demonstration satisfying these requirements. We experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules are separated by $\sim$ 2 m, and each contains dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover's search algorithm - the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising multiple non-local two-qubit gates - and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with 2 and 3 instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations. As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, this technique has applications extending beyond trapped-ion quantum computers, providing a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Frequency Combs for Satellite-based Clock Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of space-based networks will contain optical clocks embedded within satellites. To fully realize the capabilities of such clocks, high-precision clock synchronization across the networks will be necessary. Current experiments have shown the potential for classical frequency combs to synchronize remote optical clocks over free-space. However, these classical combs are restricted in precision to the standard quantum limit. Quantum frequency combs, however, which exhibit quantum properties such as squeezing and entanglement, provide pathways for going beyond the standard quantum limit. Here, we present our perspective on the prospects for practical clock synchronization in space using both classical and quantum frequency combs. We detail the current outcomes achievable with a classical frequency comb approach to synchronization, before quantifying the potential outcomes offered by quantum frequency combs. Challenges to be overcome in deploying frequency combs in space are presented, and the implications of almost-perfect synchronization for future space-based applications and experiments discussed.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological transitions associated with a Weyl exceptional ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environment-induced dissipation of an open system, once thought as a nuisance, can actually lead to emergence of many intriguing phenomena that are absent in an isolated system. Among these, Weyl exceptional rings (WER), extended from point-like singularities, are particularly interesting. Theoretically, a WER was predicted to carry a topological charge with a nonzero Chern number, but it has not been measured so far. We here investigate this topology in a circuit, where the WER is synthesized with a superconducting qubit controllably coupled to a decaying resonator. The high flexibility of the system enables us to characterize its eigenvectors on different manifolds of parameter space. We extract both the quantized Berry phase and Chern number from these eigenvectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate a topological transition triggered by shrinking the size of the manifold$-$a unique feature of the WER.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase properties of a state driven by a classical fild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonclassical state generated by an atom-cavity field interaction in presence of a driven field. In the scheme, the two-level atom is moved through the cavity and driven by a classical field. The atom interacts dispersively with the cavity field, which results in a photon-number-dependent Stark shift. Assuming that the atom enters the cavity in the excited state $|{a}\rangle$, the obtained output cavity field is taken into account. The state vector $|\psi(t)\rangle$ describes the entire atom-field system but in our work we deal with the statistical aspects of the cavity field only. The quantum state that corresponds to the output cavity field is obtained by tracing out the atom part from $|{\psi(t)}\rangle\langle{\psi(t)}|$. Different quantum phase properties such as quantum phase distribution, angular $Q$ phase function, phase dispersion are evaluated for the obtained radiation field. The second-order correlation function $g^2(0)$, an indirect phase characteristic is also considered.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited state energy calculations of the H2 molecule using a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm on an NMR quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are emerging as promising candidates for near-term practical applications of quantum information processors, in the field of quantum chemistry. We implement the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm to calculate the molecular ground-state energy of the H2 molecule and experimentally demonstrated it on an NMR quantum processor. Further, we simulate the excited states of the H2 molecule using the variational quantum deflation algorithm and experimentally demonstrate it on the same NMR quantum processor. We also develop the first simulation of the energy calculation of the H2 molecule using only a single qubit, and verify the results on an NMR quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that only a single NMR qubit suffices to calculate the molecular energies of the H2 molecule to the desired accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multi-target quantum compilation algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computing, quantum compilation involves transforming information from a target unitary into a trainable unitary represented by a quantum circuit. Traditional quantum compilation optimizes circuits for a single target. However, many quantum systems require simultaneous optimization of multiple targets, such as simulating systems with varying parameters and preparing multi-component quantum states. To address this, we develop a multi-target quantum compilation algorithm to enhance the performance and flexibility of simulating multiple quantum systems. Through our benchmarks and case studies, we demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, highlighting the significance of multi-target optimization in the advancement of quantum computing. This work establishes the groundwork for further development, implementation, and evaluation of multi-target quantum compilation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Symmetry: a fundamental resource for quantum coherence and metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for the preparation of deeply entangled states useful for quantum metrology. We show that when the quantum state is an eigenstate of an operator $A$, observables $G$ which are completely off-diagonal with respect to $A$ have purely quantum fluctuations, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, namely $F_Q(G)=4\langle G^2 \rangle$. This property holds regardless of the purity of the quantum state, and it implies that off-diagonal fluctuations represent a metrological resource for phase estimation. In particular, for many-body systems such as quantum spin ensembles or bosonic gases, the presence of off-diagonal long-range order (for a spin observable, or for bosonic operators) directly translates into a metrological resource, provided that the system remains in a well-defined symmetry sector. The latter is defined e.g. by one component of the collective spin or by its parity in spin systems; and by a particle-number sector for bosons. Our results establish the optimal use for metrology of arbitrarily non-Gaussian quantum correlations in a large variety of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Resonance in Perspective of Floquet Theory and Brillouin-Wigner Perturbation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the two-level spin resonance in a new perspective. Using the Floquet theory, the periodic interaction Hamiltonians were transfromed into a time-independent interaction. Using the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation method, a degenerated subspace is constructed, where the effective Hamiltonian is given in a perturbation expansion. In this framework, we found that the upper triangular element $\langle \alpha | H^1 | \beta \rangle$, determines whether the resonance happens. The generalized Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift were solved straightforwardly as the first order and the second order solution, proving the benefit of the developed method.</description>

      <title>Detection Efficiency Characterization for Free-Space Single-Photon Detectors: Measurement Facility and Wavelength-Dependence Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new experimental apparatus for the measurement of the detection efficiency of free-space single-photon detectors based on the substitution method. For the first time, we extend the analysis to account for the wavelength dependence introduced by the transmissivity of the optical window in front of the detector's active area. Our method involves measuring the detector's response at different wavelengths and comparing it to a calibrated reference detector. This allows us to accurately quantify the efficiency variations due to the optical window's transmissivity. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the wavelength-dependent efficiency, which is crucial for optimizing the performance of single-photon detectors in various applications, including quantum communication and photonics research. This characterization technique offers a significant advancement in the precision and reliability of single-photon detection efficiency measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an approach to achieve near-perfect unidirectional light-matter coupling to an effective quantum emitter that is formed by a subwavelength array of atoms in the Rydberg-blockade regime. The nonlinear reflection and transmission of such two-dimensional superatoms are exploited in different interferometric setups for the deterministic generation of tunable single photons and entangling two-photon operations with high fidelities, $\mathcal{F}\gtrsim0.999$. The described setup can function as a versatile nonlinear optical element in a free-space photonic quantum network with simple linear elements and without the need of additional mode confinement, optical resonators, or optical isolators.</description>

      <title>Simulating the non-Hermitian dynamics of financial option pricing with quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schrodinger equation describes how quantum states evolve according to the Hamiltonian of the system. For physical systems, we have it that the Hamiltonian must be a Hermitian operator to ensure unitary dynamics. For anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians, the Schrodinger equation instead models the evolution of quantum states in imaginary time. This process of imaginary time evolution has been used successfully to calculate the ground state of a quantum system. Although imaginary time evolution is non-unitary, the normalised dynamics of this evolution can be simulated on a quantum computer using the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm. In this paper, we broaden the scope of QITE by removing its restriction to anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which allows us to solve any partial differential equation (PDE) that is equivalent to the Schrodinger equation with an arbitrary, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. An example of such a PDE is the famous Black-Scholes equation that models the price of financial derivatives. We will demonstrate how our generalised QITE methodology offers a feasible approach for real-world applications by using it to price various European option contracts modelled according to the Black-Scholes equation.</description>

      <title>Influence of a squeezed prewell on tunneling properties and bound states in heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resonant tunneling effect of an extremely thin potential well on the transmission of charged particles through a planar heterostructure with an arbitrary potential profile is investigated in a squeezing limit as the well width tends to zero. In this limit, the transmission probability through the structure is shown to be blocked for all the parameter values of the well, except a resonance set of Lebesgue measure zero. The peak-to-valley ratio is shown to increase crucially with the squeezing of the well: the thinner is its thickness, the resonant peaks become sharper and localized at isolated points. Contrary, a discrete spectrum of the heterostructure (if any) does exist both on the resonance set and beyond it, however, the squeezing scenario here turns out to be quite interesting and sophisticated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a platform for implementing a universal, globally driven quantum computer based on a 2D ladder hosting three different species of superconducting qubits. In stark contrast with the existing literature, our scheme exploits the always-on longitudinal ZZ coupling. The latter, combined with specific driving frequencies, enables the reach of a blockade regime, which plays a pivotal role in the computing scheme.</description>

      <title>Observation of a giant Goos-H\"anchen shift for matter waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goos-H\"anchen (GH) shift describes a phenomenon in which a specularly-reflected beam is laterally translated along the reflecting surface such that the incident and reflected rays no longer intersect at the surface. Using a neutron spin-echo technique and a specially-designed magnetic multilayer mirror, we have measured the relative phase between the reflected up and down neutron spin states in total reflection. The relative GH shift calculated from this phase shows a strong resonant enhancement at a particular incident neutron wavevector, which is due to a waveguiding effect in one of the magnetic layers. Calculations based on the observed phase difference between the neutron states indicate a propagation distance along the waveguide layer of 0.65 mm for the spin-down state, which we identify with the magnitude of the giant GH shift. The existence of a physical GH shift is confirmed by the observation of neutron absorption in the waveguide layer. We propose ways in which our experimental method may be exploited for neutron quantum-enhanced sensing of thin magnetic layers.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a scalable universal two-qubit quantum processor with electron and nuclear spins in a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the quantum information processing power with limited number of hosts is vital for achieving quantum advantage. Here we propose a novel scheme that achieves a scalable n-ion-2n-qubit quantum processor utilizing four internal levels of each ion, and experimentally implement a 1-ion-2-qubit universal processor using the valence electron spin and nuclear spin of a single 171Yb+ ion. Fidelities of single-qubit and two-qubit gates are around 0.98 obtained by quantum process tomography. Additionally, the Grover's algorithm is implemented with a successful rate exceeding 0.99. We provide explicit scaling-up protocols based on standard laser-less and laser-based frameworks, and further demonstrate that the electron/nuclear-spin scheme allows less demanding two-qubit entangling gates between different ions. The replacement of some inter-atomic gates by intra-atomic gates could increase the fidelity of some quantum circuits. Our work paves the way towards achieving 2n-times increase in the size of quantum computational Hilbert space with n ions.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of dielectric particles by thermal emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated nanoparticles are a promising platform for sensing applications and for macroscopic quantum experiments. While the nanoparticles' motional temperatures can be reduced to near absolute zero, their uncontrolled internal degrees of freedom remain much hotter, inevitably leading to the emission of heat radiation. The decoherence and motional heating caused by this thermal emission process is still poorly understood beyond the case of the center-of-mass motion of point particles. Here, we present the master equation describing the impact of heat radiation on the motional quantum state of arbitrarily sized and shaped dielectric rigid rotors. It predicts the localization of spatio-orientational superpositions only based on the bulk material properties and the particle geometry. A counter-intuitive and experimentally relevant implication of the presented theory is that orientational superpositions of optically isotropic bodies are not protected by their symmetry, even in the small-particle limit.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference with a Coexisting Clock using Transceivers for Synchronization over Deployed Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference between independently generated photons is a key step towards distributing entanglement over long distances, but it requires synchronization between the distantly-located photon sources. Synchronizing the clocks of such photon sources using coexisting two-way classical optical communications over the same fiber that transport the quantum photonic signals is a promising approach for achieving photon-photon interference over long distances, enabling entanglement distribution for quantum networking using the deployed fiber infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate photon-photon interference by observing the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip between two distantly-located sources: a weak coherent state source obtained by attenuating the output of a laser and a heralded single-photon source. We achieve a maximum dip visibility of $0.58 \pm 0.04$ when the two sources are connected via $4.3$ km of deployed fiber. Dip visibilities $&gt;0.5$ are nonclassical and a first step towards achieving teleportation over the deployed fiber infrastructure. In our experiment, the classical optical communication is achieved with $-21$ dBm of optical signal launch power, which is used to synchronize the clocks in the two independent, distantly-located photon sources. The impact of spontaneous Raman scattering from the classical optical signals is mitigated by appropriate choice of the quantum and classical channel wavelengths. All equipment used in our experiment (the photon sources and the synchronization setup) is commercially available. Finally, our experiment represents a scalable approach to enabling practical quantum networking with commercial equipment and coexistence with classical communications in optical fiber.</description>

Abstract: The paper investigated a set of non-Gaussian states generated by measuring the number of particles in one of the modes of a two-mode entangled Gaussian state. It was demonstrated that all generated states depend on two types of parameters: some parameters are responsible for Gaussian characteristics, while other parameters are responsible for non-Gaussian characteristics. Among all generated states, we identified those optimally generated in terms of the generation probability and the magnitude of non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and benchmark quantum computing approaches for calculating real-time single-particle Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities of Hamiltonian systems. The approaches leverage adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and propagation. Using automatically generated compact circuits, the dynamical evolution is performed over sufficiently long times to achieve adequate frequency resolution of the response functions. We showcase accurate Green's function calculations using a statevector simulator for Fermi-Hubbard chains of 4 and 6 sites, with maximal circuit depth of 65 and 424 layers, respectively. Additionally, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1 model that incorporates the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to illustrate calculations of the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities, which can be measured in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy experiments. These results demonstrate that real-time approaches using adaptive parameterized circuits to evaluate linear and nonlinear response functions can be feasible with near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-photonic quantum repeaters are essential for establishing long-range quantum entanglement. Within repeater nodes, reliably performing entanglement swapping is a key component of scalable quantum communication. To tackle the challenge of probabilistic Bell state measurement in linear optics, which often leads to information loss, various approaches have been proposed to ensure the loss tolerance of distributing a single ebit. We have generalized previous work regarding repeater graph states with elaborate connectivity, enabling the efficient establishment of exploitable ebits at a finite rate with high probability. We demonstrate that our new scheme significantly outperforms the previous work with much flexibility and discuss the generation overhead of such resource states. These findings offer new insights into the scalability and reliability of loss-tolerant quantum networks.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetry induced Bi-Stability in Non-Hermitian Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the steady-state non-Hermitian magnomechanical system driven by a transverse magnetic field directly interacting with YIG sphere and excites cavity magnons and photons. To make the system non-Hermitian, we use a traveling field directly interacting with magnons generating gain to the system. We start by illustrating PT-configuration of the system, which contains two PT broken region around exceptional point and PT protected region along the axis of exceptional point. Late, we discover that the numbers of cavity photons and magnons show bistable behavior depending upon the PT configuration, which becomes more significant as the values of the magnon-photon coupling and traveling field strength increases. We illustrate that steady-state photon only shows bistable behavior when the system in in lossy PT broken configuration, means strength of traveling field is less than the magnon-photon coupling. Otherwise, it will just contain a single stable state because of bistability suppression with gain in the system, which is unlike with any other investigation in this direction. Further, a larger magnon-photon coupling increases photon intensity and decreases magnon intensity, because of photon and magnon energy exchange, leading to enhanced photon bistablity and decreased magnon bistability. However, in case of increasing strength of traveling field, both photon as well as magnon bistability is appeared to be decreasing. We also study the steady-state effective potential of the system and illustrate the occurrence of bistability with nonlinear interactions between contour trajectories, which similarly depends on the PT broken configuration of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the concept of Classicality and derive Wigner inequalities that depend on two instants, with a potential extension to three instants. We explore the experimental feasibility of testing the violations of these inequalities in both pure and mixed flavor states of $K^0$-, $D^0$-, and $B_s$- meson pairs. Using the Werner noise model, we demonstrate that violations of time-dependent Wigner inequalities can be detected even when background processes constitute up to 50% of the system.</description>

      <title>A diagrammatic language for the Causaloid framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Causaloid framework is an operational approach aimed to house both the radical aspects of General Relativity -- dynamic causal structure, and Quantum Theory -- indefiniteness, to provide a scaffolding that might be suitable for Quantum Gravity by providing a landscape of theories that allow for indefinite causal structure. One may consider it as a generalisation of generalised probability theories (or GPTs) where a priori regions are not assumed to have any given causal relationship, to incorporate the possibility of indefinite causal structure. Since its conception, there have been many advances in the field of indefinite causal structure mostly stemming from the work of Chiribella et al. on the quantum switch and supermaps and from Oreshkov et al. on causal inequalities and process matrices. These approaches have systems moving along wires and use Hilbert space structure. They violate the standard causality constraints of Quantum Theory and, in this sense, can be regarded as post-quantum. The Causaloid approach does not necessarily have systems moving along wires or Hilbert spaces. This is the first paper in a trilogy of papers aiming to close the gap between the Causaloid (that allows for GPTs) and post-quantum studies that employ Hilbert spaces. To do so in the present paper, we provide a diagrammatic language for the Causaloid framework along with new terminology for the three levels of physical compression (called Tomographic, Compositional, and Meta compression).</description>

      <title>CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-foundry-fabricated piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuit platform for ultraviolet and blue wavelengths, using alumina waveguides that are strongly mechanically coupled to monolithically integrated aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators. Low waveguide losses are measured down to at least 320 nm, where we achieve 1.6 dB/cm. This allows us to demonstrate broadband amplitude modulators based on piezoelectrically actuated MEMS cantilever phase-shifters down to 320 nm, with a high extinction ratio of 30 dB. We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform by designing and demonstrating a modulator that can work with high extinction and low loss at 320 nm and 420 nm, simultaneously, demonstrating control of multiple, disparate wavelengths in one device. We also demonstrate narrow-band resonant racetrack modulators with quality factors of 4.7E5 and a tuning rate of 27.5 MHz/V. These results should open doors for a range of novel applications in UV photonics, quantum science, sensing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a massive scalar field non-minimally coupled with gravity is considered. Assuming a regular and spherically symmetric background, specifically a regular black hole solution, the energy-momentum tensor is calculated. Using the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism and its topological structure, the corresponding Stefan-Boltzmann law and Casimir effect are investigated. The results for the regular black hole are compared with those obtained for the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heimburg-Jackson model, or thermodynamic soliton theory of nervous impulses, has a well-established record as an alternative model for studying the dynamics of nerve impulses and lipid bilayers. Within this framework, nerve impulses can be represented as nonlinear excitations of low amplitude depicted by the damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and their adiabatic evolution can be analyzed using direct perturbative methods. Based on the foregoing, we carry out the current study using the quasi-stationary approach to obtain the adiabatic evolution of solitons embedded in lipid bilayers under the influence of a viscous elastic fluid. This analysis encompasses liquid-to-gel transition of the lipid bilayers, for whose dark and bright solitons arise, respectively.</description>

      <title>Abstract ladder operators for non self-adjoint Hamiltonians, with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ladder operators are useful, if not essential, in the analysis of some given physical system since they can be used to find easily eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its Hamiltonian. In this paper we extend our previous results on abstract ladder operators considering in many details what happens if the Hamiltonian of the system is not self-adjoint. Among other results, we give an existence criterion for coherent states constructed as eigenstates of our lowering operators. In the second part of the paper we discuss two different examples of our framework: pseudo-quons and a deformed generalized Heisenberg algebra. Incidentally, and interestingly enough, we show that pseudo-quons can be used to diagonalize an oscillator-like Hamiltonian written in terms of (non self-adjoint) position and momentum operators which obey a deformed commutation rule of the kind often considered in minimal length quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuation and noise spectra in two-dimensional Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical fluctuations play a fundamental role in determining the spin orders for low-dimensional quantum materials, especially for recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) magnets. Here we employ the quantum decoherence imaging technique utilizing nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to explore the critical magnetic fluctuations and the associated temporal spin noise in van der Waals magnet $\rm{Fe_{3}GeTe_{2}}$. We show that the critical fluctuation contributes to a random magnetic field characterized by the noise spectra, which can be changed dramatically near the critical temperature $T_c$. A theoretical model to describe this phenomenon is developed, showing that the spectral density is characterized by a $1/f$ noise near the $T_c$, while away from this point it behaves like a white noise. The crossover at a certain temperature between these two situations is determined by changing of the distance between the sample and the diamond. This work provides a new way to study critical fluctuation and to extract some of the critical exponents, which may greatly deepen our understanding of criticality in a wide range of physical systems.</description>

      <title>On the Continuity of Schur-Horn Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schur-Horn theorem is a well-known result that characterizes the relationship between the diagonal elements and eigenvalues of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix. In this paper, we extend this theorem by exploring the eigenvalue perturbation of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix with fixed diagonals, which is referred to as the continuity of the Schur-Horn mapping. We introduce a concept called strong Schur-Horn continuity, characterized by minimal constraints on the perturbation. We demonstrate that several categories of matrices exhibit strong Schur-Horn continuity. Leveraging this notion, along with a majorization constraint on the perturbation, we prove the Schur-Horn continuity for general symmetric (Hermitian) matrices. The Schur-Horn continuity finds applications in oblique manifold optimization related to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence of a long-lifetime exciton-polariton condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum information science has made significant progress, leading to a multitude of quantum protocols for the most diverse applications. States carrying resources such as quantum coherence are a key component for these protocols. In this study, we optimize the quantum coherence of a nonresonantly excited exciton-polariton condensate of long living polaritons by minimizing the condensate's interaction with the surrounding reservoir of excitons and free carriers. By combining experimental phase space data with a displaced thermal state model, we observe how quantum coherence builds up as the system is driven above the condensation threshold. Our findings demonstrate that a spatial separation between the condensate and the reservoir enhances the state's maximum quantum coherence directly beyond the threshold. These insights pave the way for integrating polariton systems into hybrid quantum devices and advancing applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The Future of QKD Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in quantum technologies, the QKD market exploded. World players are scrambling to win the race towards global QKD networks, even before the rules and policies required by such large endeavors were even discussed. Several vendors are on the market, each with specific parameters and advantages (in terms of key rate, link range, KMS software, etc.), hence considerable effort is now made towards standardization. While quantum communications is expected to reach a market size of up to \$36B by 2040, the largest QKD initiative to date is EuroQCI, which, due to its sheer scale, is forcing the market to mature. Although building a QKD network is believed to be trivial today, inter-connecting federated networks on a global scale is a heavy challenge. We propose QKD virtual networks not only as a useful infrastructure abstraction for increased flexibility and granular security, but as an inevitable solution for several problems that future QKD networks will encounter on the way towards widespread adoption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital degrees of freedom play an important role for understanding the emergence of unconventional quantum phases. Ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices provide a wonderful platform to simulate orbital physics. In this work, we consider spinless fermionic atoms loaded into $p$-orbital bands of a two-dimensional frustrated triangular lattice. The system can be described by an extended Fermi-Hubbard model, which is numerically solved by using the orbital version of real-space dynamical mean-field theory. Low-temperature phase diagrams are obtained, which contain stripe-, ferro- and para-orbital ordered quantum phases, due to the interplay of anisotropic hoppings and geometrical frustration. In order to understand the underlying mechanics of competing orbital orders, we derive an effective orbital-exchange model, which yields consistent explanation with our main numerical results.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it is postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, I find that the energy conservation law requires these mass eigenstates, if they exist, to be entangled with distinct joint energy eigenstates of the other particles produced by the same weak interaction as the neutrino. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's mass eigenstates, which are responsible for flavor oscillations under the aforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually originate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation method for magnetoelastic coupling between surface acoustic waves and spin waves using electrical and optical measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling and hybridization of different elementary excitations leads to new functionalities. In phononics and spintronics, magnetoelastic coupling between Rayleigh-type surface acoustic wave (SAW) and spin wave (SW) has recently attracted much attention. Quantitatively evaluating and comparing the coupled system are essential to develop the study of the magnetoelastic SAW-SW coupling. So far, previous studies of SAW-SW coupling have employed a quantity called coupling strength. However, it is still challenging to compare the coupling strength values among studies fairly because the quantity depends on the device geometry and the applied magnetic field angle, which are not unified among the previous studies. Here, we focus on a practical constant composed of a magnetoelastic constant and a strain amplitude that depends only on the material properties. We demonstrate a versatile evaluation technique to evaluate the practical constant by combining electrical measurements and optical imaging. An essential part of the technique is an analysis that can be used under off-resonance conditions where SAW and SW resonance frequencies do not match. Existing analysis can only handle the case under on-resonance conditions. Our analysis makes it possible to observe the magnetoelastic couplings between SAW with resonance frequencies that can be imaged optically and SW with resonance frequencies in the gigahertz range. Our demonstrated technique, which uses electrical and optical measurements under off-resonance conditions, can significantly advance research on SAW-SW coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effect in arbitrary dimensions: non-Bloch band theory and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by a significant accumulation of eigenstates at system boundaries. While well-understood in one dimension via non-Bloch band theory, unraveling the NHSE in higher dimensions faces formidable challenges due to the diversity of open boundary conditions or lattice geometries and inevitable numerical errors. Key issues, including higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory, geometric dependency, spectral convergence and stability, and a complete classification of NHSE, remain elusive. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a geometry-adaptive non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions, through the lens of spectral potential. Our formulation accurately determines the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone for a given geometry in the thermodynamic limit (TDL), revealing their geometric dependencies. Furthermore, we systematically classify the NHSE into critical and non-reciprocal types using net winding numbers. In the critical case, we identify novel scale-free skin modes residing on the boundary. In the nonreciprocal case, the skin modes manifest in various forms, including normal or anomalous corner modes, boundary modes or scale-free modes. We reveal the non-convergence and instability of the non-Bloch spectra in the presence of scale-free modes and attribute it to the non-exchangeability of the zero-perturbation limit and the TDL. The instability drives the energy spectra towards the Amoeba spectra in the critical case. Our findings provide a unified non-Bloch band theory governing the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone in the TDL, offering a comprehensive understanding of NHSE in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric transfer matrix analysis of Lyapunov exponents in one-dimensional non-reciprocal quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lyapunov exponent, serving as an indicator of the localized state, is commonly utilized to identify localization transitions in disordered systems. In non-Hermitian quasicrystals, the non-Hermitian effect induced by non-reciprocal hopping can lead to the manifestation of two distinct Lyapunov exponents on opposite sides of the localization center. Building on this observation, we here introduce a comprehensive approach for examining the localization characteristics and mobility edges of non-reciprocal quasicrystals, referred to as asymmetric transfer matrix analysis. We demonstrate the application of this method to three specific scenarios: the non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'e model, the non-reciprocal off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e model, and the non-reciprocal mosaic quasicrystals. This work may contribute valuable insights to the investigation of non-Hermitian quasicrystal and disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on \emph{gauge fixing}. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</description>

Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

Abstract: Topological winding in non-Hermitian systems are generally associated to the Bloch band properties of lattice Hamiltonians. However, in certain non-Hermitian models topological winding naturally arise from the dynamical evolution of the system and related to a new form of geometric phase. Here we investigate dynamical topological winding in non-Hermitian photonic mesh lattices, where the mean survival time of an optical pulse circulating in coupled fiber loops is quantized and robust against Hamiltonian deformations. The suggested photonic model could provide an experimentally accessible platform for the observation of non-Hermitian dynamical topological windings.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Higher Dimensional Nonlocality against dual noise and sequential measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robustness in the violation of Collins-Linden-Gisin-Masser-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality is investigated from the dual perspective of noise in measurements as well as in states. To quantify it, we introduce a quantity called the area of nonlocal region which reveals a dimensional advantage. Specifically, we report that with the increase of dimension, the maximally violating states show a greater enhancement in the area of nonlocal region in comparison to the maximally entangled states and the scaling of the increment, in this case, grows faster than visibility. Moreover, we examine the robustness in the sequential violation of CGLMP inequality using weak measurements and find that even for higher dimensions, two observers showing a simultaneous violation of the CGLMP inequality as obtained for two-qubit states persists. We notice that the complementarity between information gain and disturbance by measurements is manifested by the decrease of the visibility in the first round and the increase of the same in the second round with dimensions. Furthermore, the amount of white noise that can be added to a maximally entangled state so that it gives two rounds of the violation, decreases with the dimension, while the same does not appreciably change for the maximally violating states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy for bosonic quantum Gaussian systems. Such generalization determines the minimum values of linear combinations of the entropies of subsystems associated to arbitrary linear functions of the quadratures, and holds for arbitrary quantum states including the scenario where the entropies are conditioned on a memory quantum system. We apply our result to prove new entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory, a generalization of the quantum Entropy Power Inequality, and the linear time scaling of the entanglement entropy produced by quadratic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality is associated with the local indistinguishability of orthogonal states. Unextendible product basis (UPB), a widely used tool in quantum information, exhibits nonlocality which is the powerful resource for quantum information processing. In this work we extend the definitions of nonlocality and genuine nonlocality from states to operators. We also extend UPB to the notions of unextendible product operator basis, unextendible product unitary operator basis (UPUOB) and strongly UPUOB. We construct their examples, and show the nonlocality of some strongly UPUOBs under local operations and classical communications. We study the phenomenon of these operators acting on quantum states. As an application, we distinguish the two-dimensional strongly UPUOB which only consumes three ebits of entanglement. Our results imply that such UPUOBs exhibit nonlocality as UPBs and the distinguishability of them requires entanglement resources.</description>

      <title>Truncated phase-based quantum arithmetic: error propagation and resource reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two important, and potentially interconnecting, avenues to the realisation of large-scale quantum algorithms: improvement of the hardware, and reduction of resource requirements demanded by algorithm components. In focusing on the latter, one crucial subroutine to many sought-after applications is the quantum adder. A variety of different implementations exist with idiosyncratic pros and cons. One of these, the Draper quantum Fourier adder, offers the lowest qubit count of any adder, but requires a substantial number of gates as well as extremely fine rotations. In this work, we present a modification of the Draper adder which eliminates small-angle rotations to highly coarse levels, matched with some strategic corrections. This reduces hardware requirements without sacrificing the qubit saving. We show that the inherited loss of fidelity is directly given by the rate of carry and borrow bits in the computation. We derive formulae to predict this, complemented by complete gate-level matrix product state simulations of the circuit. Moreover, we analytically describe the effects of possible stochastic control error. We present an in-depth analysis of this approach in the context of Shor's algorithm, focusing on the factoring of RSA-2048. Surprisingly, we find that each of the $7\times 10^7$ quantum Fourier transforms may be truncated down to $\pi/64$, with additive rotations left only slightly finer. This result is much more efficient than previously realised. We quantify savings both in terms of logical resources and raw magic states, demonstrating that phase adders can be competitive with Toffoli-based constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve efficiently various difficult computational problems is an outstanding challenge for science and technology. In this work, we propose a technique for an efficient implementation of quantum algorithms with multilevel quantum systems (qudits). Our method uses a transpilation of a circuit in the standard qubit form, which depends on the parameters of a qudit-based processor, such as their number and the number of accessible levels. This approach provides a qubit-to-qudit mapping and comparison to a standard realization of quantum algorithms highlighting potential advantages of qudits. We provide an explicit scheme of transpiling qubit circuits into sequences of single-qudit and two-qudit gates taken from a particular universal set. We then illustrate our method by considering an example of an efficient implementation of a $6$-qubit quantum algorithm with qudits. We expect that our findings are of relevance for ongoing experiments with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices that operate with information carrier allowing qudit encodings, such as trapped ions and neutral atoms as well as optical and solid-state systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using near-term quantum computers to achieve a quantum advantage requires efficient strategies to improve the performance of the noisy quantum devices presently available. We develop and experimentally validate two efficient error mitigation protocols named "Noiseless Output Extrapolation" and "Pauli Error Cancellation" that can drastically enhance the performance of quantum circuits composed of noisy cycles of gates. By combining popular mitigation strategies such as probabilistic error cancellation and noise amplification with efficient noise reconstruction methods, our protocols can mitigate a wide range of noise processes that do not satisfy the assumptions underlying existing mitigation protocols, including non-local and gate-dependent processes. We test our protocols on a four-qubit superconducting processor at the Advanced Quantum Testbed. We observe significant improvements in the performance of both structured and random circuits, with up to $86\%$ improvement in variation distance over the unmitigated outputs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocols, as well as their practicality for current hardware platforms.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information can provide a lens for characterizing the operational implications of spacetime physics. A well-known result in this area is that quantum entanglement is degraded in the vicinity of a black hole. This result treats the black hole and its spacetime as classical. But what if these were to be treated quantum-mechanically? Here, we show that quantum coherence in black hole, and thus spacetime, degrees of freedom can limit the degradation of entanglement, thereby improving the performance of nearby quantum communication protocols. This finding indicates that quantum features of spacetime could serve as resources for quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz is a promising tool for achieving high-precision results using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in the NISQ era. However, results on quantum hardware are thus far very limited and simulations have only accessed small system sizes. We advance the state of the art of UCC simulations by utilizing an efficient sparse wavefunction circuit solver and studying systems up to 64 qubits. Here we report results obtained using this solver that demonstrate the power of the UCC ansatz and address pressing questions about optimal initial parameterizations and circuit construction, among others. Our approach enables meaningful benchmarking of the UCC ansatz, a crucial step in assessing the utility of VQE for achieving quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in qudit-based quantum computing, in particular with trapped ions, open interesting possibilities for scaling quantum processors without increasing the number of physical information carriers. In this work, we propose a method for compiling quantum circuits in the case, where qubits are embedded into qudits of experimentally relevant dimensionalities, $d=3,\ldots,8$, for the trapped-ion platform. In particular, we demonstrate how single-qubit, two-qubit, and multiqubit gates can be realized using single-qudit operations and the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) gate as a basic two-particle operation. We expect that our findings are directly applicable to trapped-ion-based qudit processors.</description>

      <title>Good Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes from the NTRU cryptosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of random Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes derived from the cryptanalysis of the so-called NTRU cryptosystem. The derived codes are good in that they exhibit constant rate and average distance scaling $\Delta \propto \sqrt{n}$ with high probability, where $n$ is the number of bosonic modes, which is a distance scaling equivalent to that of a GKP code obtained by concatenating single mode GKP codes into a qubit-quantum error correcting code with linear distance. The derived class of NTRU-GKP codes has the additional property that decoding for a stochastic displacement noise model is equivalent to decrypting the NTRU cryptosystem, such that every random instance of the code naturally comes with an efficient decoder. This construction highlights how the GKP code bridges aspects of classical error correction, quantum error correction as well as post-quantum cryptography. We underscore this connection by discussing the computational hardness of decoding GKP codes and propose, as a new application, a simple public key quantum communication protocol with security inherited from the NTRU cryptosystem.</description>

Abstract: The most efficient automated way to construct a large class of quantum photonic experiments is via abstract representation of graphs with certain properties. While new directions were explored using Artificial intelligence and SAT solvers to find such graphs, it becomes computationally infeasible to do so as the size of the graph increases. So, we take an analytical approach and introduce the technique of local sparsification on experiment graphs, using which we answer a crucial open question in experimental quantum optics, namely whether certain complex entangled quantum states can be constructed. This provides us with more insights into quantum resource theory, the limitation of specific quantum photonic systems and initiates the use of graph-theoretic techniques for designing quantum physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to efficiently solve a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which play a crucial role in various industries and scientific fields. However, it remains unclear which system of nonlinear ODEs, and under what assumptions, can achieve exponential speedup using quantum computers. In this work, we introduce a class of systems of nonlinear ODEs that can be efficiently solved on quantum computers, where the efficiency is defined as solving the system with computational complexity of $O(T {\rm log}(N) {\rm polylog}(1/\epsilon))$, where $T$ is the evolution time, $\epsilon$ is the allowed error, and $N$ is the number of variables in the system. Specifically, we employ the Koopman-von Neumann linearization to map the system of nonlinear ODEs to Hamiltonian dynamics and find conditions where the norm of the mapped Hamiltonian is preserved and the Hamiltonian is sparse. This allows us to use the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technique for solving the nonlinear ODEs with $O({\rm log}(N))$ overhead. Furthermore, we show that the nonlinear ODEs include a wide range of systems of nonlinear ODEs, such as the nonlinear harmonic oscillators and the short-range Kuramoto model. Since this is the first concrete example of solving systems of nonlinear ODEs with exponential quantum speedup by the Koopman-von Neumann linearization, these findings contribute significantly to the application of quantum computers in solving nonlinear problems.</description>

Abstract: We question the role of entanglement in masking quantum information contained in a set of mixed quantum states. We first show that a masker that can mask any two single-qubit pure states, can mask the entire set of mixed states comprising of the classical mixtures of those two pure qubit states as well. We then try to find the part played by entanglement in masking two different sets: One, a set of mixed states formed by the classical mixtures of two single-qubit pure commuting states, and another, a set of mixed states obtained by mixing two single-qubit pure non-commuting states. For both cases, we show that the masked states remain entangled unless the input state is an equal mixture of the two pure states. This in turn reveals that entanglement is necessary for masking an arbitrary set of two single qubit states, regardless of their mixednesses and mutual commutativity.</description>

Abstract: Orthogonality of eigenstates of different energies and its implications in potential scattering are unlabeled. Scalar products of scattering states of different energies are found to have finite non-orthogonal terms in potentials of finite widths. Their superpositions have time-dependent norms, and are not suitable for isolate states. In these systems, a perturbative method and a variational method are viable methods for finding a rigorous transition probability that describes phenomena completely. In various exceptional potentials, an orthogonality is satisfied.</description>

Abstract: We derive the predicted time dilation of delocalized atomic clocks in an optical lattice setup in the presence of a gravitational field to leading order in quantum relativistic corrections. We investigate exotic quantum states of motion whose relativistic time dilation is outside of the realm of classical general relativity, finding a regime where $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ optical lattice clocks currently in development would comfortably be able to detect this quantum effect (if the technical challenge of generating such states can be met and the expected accuracy of such clocks can be attained). We provide a detailed experimental protocol and analyse the effects of noise on our predictions. We also show that the magnitude of our predicted quantum relativistic time dilation effect remains just out of detectable reach for the current generation of $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}$ optical lattice clocks. Our calculations agree with the predicted time dilation of classical general relativity when restricting to Gaussian states.</description>

Abstract: In order to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, we need to repeat the following sequence of four steps: First, perform 1 or 2 qubit quantum gates (in parallel if possible). Second, do a syndrome measurement on a subset of the qubits. Third, perform a fast classical computation to establish which errors have occurred (if any). Fourth, depending on the errors, we apply a correction step. Then the procedure repeats with the next sequence of gates. In order for these four steps to succeed, we need the error rate of the gates to be below a certain threshold. Unfortunately, the error rates of current quantum hardware are still too high. On the other hand, current quantum hardware platforms are designed with these four steps in mind. In this work we make use of this four-step scheme not to carry out fault-tolerant computations, but to enhance short, constant-depth, quantum circuits that perform 1 qubit gates and nearest-neighbor 2 qubit gates. To explore how this can be useful, we study a computational model which we call Local Alternating Quantum Classical Computations (LAQCC). In this model, qubits are placed in a grid allowing nearest neighbor interactions; the quantum circuits are of constant depth with intermediate measurements; a classical controller can perform log-depth computations on these intermediate measurement outcomes to control future quantum operations. This model fits naturally between quantum algorithms in the NISQ era and full fledged fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that LAQCC circuits can create long-ranged interactions, which constant-depth quantum circuits cannot achieve, and use it to construct a range of useful multi-qubit gates. With these gates, we create three new state preparation protocols for a uniform superposition over an arbitrary number of states, W-states, Dicke states and may-body scar states.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the impact of dissipation on time-reversed one-axis-twist quantum-sensing protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin squeezing can increase the sensitivity of interferometric measurements of small signals in large spin ensembles beyond the standard quantum limit. In many practical settings, the ideal metrological gain is limited by imperfect readout of the sensor. To overcome this issue, protocols based on time reversal of unitary one-axis-twist (OAT) spin-squeezing dynamics have been proposed. Such protocols mitigate readout noise and, when implemented using cavity feedback, have been argued to also be robust against dissipation as long as the collective cooperativity of the system is sufficiently large [Davis et al., PRL 116, 053601 (2016)]. Here, we perform a careful systematic study of dissipative effects on three different implementations of a OAT twist-untwist sensing scheme (based on symmetric as well as asymmetric cavity feedback and on a Tavis-Cummings interaction). Our full treatment shows that the three approaches have markedly different properties and resilience when subject to dissipation. Moreover, the metrological gain for an implementation using symmetric cavity feedback is more sensitive to undesired dissipation than was previously appreciated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06273v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report on a novel quantum state reconstruction process based on the disentanglement algorithm. Using variational quantum circuits, we disentangle the quantum state to a product of computational zero states. Inverse evolution of the zero states reconstructs the quantum state up to an overall phase. By sequentially disentangling the qubit one by one, we reduce the required measurements with only single qubit measurement. Demonstrations with our proposal for the reconstruction of the random states are presented where variational quantum circuit is optimized by disentangling process. To facilitate experimental implementation, we also employ reinforcement learning for quantum circuit design with limited discrete quantum gates. Our method is universal and imposes no specific ansatz or constrain on the quantum state.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement and interference are both hallmark effects of quantum physics. Particularly rich dynamics arise when multiple (at least partially) indistinguishable particles are subjected to either of these phenomena. By combining both entanglement and many-particle interference, we propose an interferometric setting through which N-particle interference can be observed, while any interference of lower orders is strictly suppressed. We experimentally demonstrate this effect in a four-photon interferometer, where the interference is nonlocal, in principle, as only pairs of photons interfere at two separate and independent beam splitters. A joint detection of all four photons identifies a high-visibility interference pattern varying as a function of their collective four-particle phase, a genuine four-body property.</description>

      <title>Random coordinate descent: a simple alternative for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms rely on the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits in noisy settings. The commonly used back-propagation procedure in classical machine learning is not directly applicable in this setting due to the collapse of quantum states after measurements. Thus, gradient estimations constitute a significant overhead in a gradient-based optimization of such quantum circuits. This paper introduces a random coordinate descent algorithm as a practical and easy-to-implement alternative to the full gradient descent algorithm. This algorithm only requires one partial derivative at each iteration. Motivated by the behavior of measurement noise in the practical optimization of parameterized quantum circuits, this paper presents an optimization problem setting that is amenable to analysis. Under this setting, the random coordinate descent algorithm exhibits the same level of stochastic stability as the full gradient approach, making it as resilient to noise. The complexity of the random coordinate descent method is generally no worse than that of the gradient descent and can be much better for various quantum optimization problems with anisotropic Lipschitz constants. Theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments validate our findings.</description>

Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) are pivotal tools for simplifying the development of quantum algorithms. These techniques leverage polynomial transformations on the eigenvalues or singular values of block-encoded matrices, achieved with the use of just one control qubit. In contexts where the control qubit is used to extract information about the eigenvalues or singular values, the amount of extractable information is limited to one bit per protocol. In this work, we extend the original QSP ansatz by introducing multiple control qubits. We show that, much like in the single-qubit case, nearly any vector of polynomials can be implemented with a multi-qubit QSP ansatz, and the gate complexity scales polynomially with the dimension of such states. Moreover, assuming that powers of the matrix to transform are easily implementable - as in Shor's algorithm - we can achieve polynomial transformations with degrees that scale exponentially with the number of control qubits. This work aims to provide a partial characterization of the polynomials that can be implemented using this approach, with phase estimation schemes and discrete logarithm serving as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Moment expansion method for composite open quantum systems including a damped oscillator mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a damped oscillator mode that is resonantly driven and is coupled to an arbitrary target system via the position quadrature operator. For such a composite open quantum system, we develop a numerical method to compute the reduced density matrix of the target system and the low-order moments of the quadrature operators. In this method, we solve the evolution equations for quantities related to moments of the quadrature operators, rather than for the density matrix elements as in the conventional approach. The application to an optomechanical setting shows that the new method can compute the correlation functions accurately with a significant reduction in the computational cost. Since the method does not involve any approximation in its abstract formulation itself, we investigate the numerical accuracy closely. This study reveals the numerical sensitivity of the new approach in certain parameter regimes. We find that this issue can be alleviated by using the position basis instead of the commonly used Fock basis.</description>

Abstract: Stabilizer circuits arise in almost every area of quantum computation and communication, so there is an interest in studying them from information-theoretic perspective, i.e. as quantum channels. We consider several natural approaches to what can be called a Clifford channel: the channel that can be realised by a stabilizer circuit without classical control, the channel that sends pure stabilizer states to mixed stabilizer states, the channel with stabilizer Choi state, the channel whose Stinespring dilation can have a Clifford unitary. We show the equivalence of these definitions. Up to unitary encoding and decoding maps any Clifford channel is a product of stabilizer state preparations, qubit discardings, identity channels and full dephasing channels. This simple structure allows to compute information capacities of such channels.</description>

      <title>The signaling dimension in generalized probabilistic theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signaling dimension of a given physical system quantifies the minimum dimension of a classical system required to reproduce all input/output correlations of the given system. Thus, unlike other dimension measures - such as the dimension of the linear space or the maximum number of (jointly or pairwise) perfectly discriminable states - which examine the correlation space only along a single direction, the signaling dimension does not depend on the arbitrary choice of a specific operational task. In this sense, the signaling dimension summarizes the structure of the entire set of input/output correlations consistent with a given system in a single scalar quantity. For quantum theory, it was recently proved by Frenkel and Weiner in a seminal result that the signaling dimension coincides with the Hilbert space dimension. Here, we derive analytical and algorithmic techniques to compute the signaling dimension for any given system of any given generalized probabilistic theory. We prove that it suffices to consider extremal measurements with ray-extremal effects, and we bound the number of elements of any such measurement in terms of the linear dimension. For systems with a finite number of extremal effects, we recast the problem of characterizing the extremal measurements with ray-extremal effects as the problem of deriving the vertex description of a polytope given its face description, which can be conveniently solved by standard techniques. For each such measurement, we recast the computation of the signaling dimension as a linear program, and we propose a combinatorial branch and bound algorithm to reduce its size. We apply our results to derive the extremal measurements with ray-extremal effects of a composition of two square bits (or squits) and prove that their signaling dimension is five, even though each squit has a signaling dimension equal to two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical proposal for preparing and manipulating a state of a single continuous-variable degree of freedom confined to a nonharmonic potential. By utilizing optimally controlled modulation of the potential's position and depth, we demonstrate the generation of non-Gaussian states, including Fock, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill, multi-legged-cat, and cubic-phase states, as well as the implementation of arbitrary unitaries within a selected two-level subspace. Additionally, we propose protocols for single-shot orthogonal state discrimination, algorithmic cooling, and correcting for nonlinear evolution. We analyze the robustness of this control scheme against noise. Since all the presented protocols rely solely on the precise modulation of the effective nonharmonic potential landscape, they are relevant to several experiments with continuous-variable systems, including the motion of a single particle in an optical tweezer or lattice, or current in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Magic Transitions in Monitored Clifford+T Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical simulation of highly-entangling quantum dynamics is conjectured to be generically hard. Thus, recently discovered measurement-induced transitions between highly entangling and low-entanglement dynamics are phase transitions in classical simulability. Here, we study simulability transitions beyond entanglement: noting that some highly-entangling dynamics (e.g., integrable systems or Clifford circuits) are easy to classically simulate, thus requiring "magic"--a subtle form of quantum resource--to achieve computational hardness, we ask how the dynamics of magic competes with measurements. We study the resulting "dynamical magic transitions" focusing on random monitored Clifford circuits doped by T gates (injecting magic). We identify dynamical "stabilizer-purification"--the collapse of a superposition of stabilizer states by measurements--as the mechanism driving this transition. We find cases where transitions in magic and entanglement coincide, but also others with a magic and simulability transition in a highly (volume-law) entangled phase. In establishing our results, we use Pauli-based computation, a scheme distilling the quantum essence of the dynamics to a magic state register subject to mutually commuting measurements. We link stabilizer-purification to "magic fragmentation" wherein these measurements separate into disjoint, O(1)-weight blocks, and relate this to the spread of magic in the original circuit becoming arrested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) and decoherence-free subspace (DFS) codes provide active and passive means, respectively, to address certain types of errors that arise during quantum computation. The latter technique is suitable to correct correlated errors with certain symmetries and the former to correct independent errors. The concatenation of a QECC and a DFS code results in a degenerate code that splits into actively and passively correcting parts, with the degeneracy impacting either part, leading to degenerate errors as well as degenerate stabilizer operators. The concatenation of the two types of code can aid universal fault-tolerant quantum computation when a mix of correlated and independent errors is encountered. In particular, we show that for sufficiently strongly correlated errors, the concatenation with the DFS as the inner code provides better entanglement fidelity, whereas for sufficiently independent errors, the concatenation with the QECC as the inner code is preferable. As illustrative examples, we examine in detail the concatenation of a two-qubit DFS code and a three-qubit repetition code or five-qubit Knill-Laflamme code, under independent and correlated errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of many-body interactions holds significant importance in both quantum foundations and information. Hamiltonians coupling multiple particles at once, beyond others, can lead to a faster entanglement generation, multiqubit gate implementation and improved error correction. As an increasing number of quantum platforms enable the realization of such physical settings, it becomes interesting to study the verification of many-body interaction resources. In this work, we explore the possibility of higher-order couplings detection through the quantum Fisher information. For a family of symmetric and translationally invariant $k$-body Ising-like Hamiltonians, we derive the bounds on the quantum Fisher information in product states. Due to its ordering with respect to the order of interaction, we demonstrate the possibility of detecting many-body couplings for a given Hamiltonian from the discussed family by observing violations of an appropriate bound. As a possible extension to these observations, we further analyse an example concerning the three-body interaction detection in the XY model.</description>

Abstract: This is an attempt to clarify certain concepts related to a debate on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, a debate between Andrei Khrennikov on the one side and Blake Stacey and R\"udiger Schack on the other side. Central to this debate is the notion of quantum probabilities. I first take up the probability concept in the QBist school, and then give my own arguments for the Born formula for calculating quantum probabilities. In that connection I also sketch some consequences of my approach towards the foundation and interpretation of quantum theory. I discuss my general views on QBism as a possible alternative interpretation before I give some final remarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that non-Abelian anyons can emerge from an Abelian topologically ordered system subject to local time-periodic driving. This is illustrated with the toric-code model, as the canonical representative of a broad class of Abelian topological spin liquids. The Abelian anyons in the toric code include fermionic and bosonic quasiparticle excitations which see each other as $\pi$ fluxes, namely they result in the accumulation of a $\pi$ phase if wound around each other. Non-Abelian behaviour emerges because the Floquet modulation can engineer a non-trivial band topology for the fermions, inducing their fractionalization into Floquet-Majorana modes bound to the bosons. The latter then develop non-Abelian character akin to vortices in topological superconductors, realizing Ising topological order. Our findings shed light on the nonequilibrium physics of driven topologically ordered quantum matter and may facilitate the observation of non-Abelian behaviour in engineered quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Control over the coupling between multiple modes of a frequency comb is an important step toward measurement-based quantum computation with a continuous-variable system. We demonstrate the creation of square-ladder correlation graphs in a microwave comb with 95 modes. The graphs are engineered through precise control of the relative phase of three pumps applied to a Josephson parametric oscillator. Experimental measurement of the mode scattering matrix is in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on a linearized equation of motion of the parametric oscillator. The digital methods used to create and measure the correlations are easily scaled to more modes and more pumps, with the potential to tailor a specific correlation graph topology.</description>

Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>

Abstract: We present the first experimental observation of quantized Klein tunneling in a bounded Dirac system, implemented by a dimer chain of dielectric microwave resonators. Both the unusual quantized levels and corresponding spinor states hybridized from distinct particle and hole wavefunctions are measured. All observations are in quantitative agreement with the hitherto-untested prediction of Dirac equation. Our results make an important step to realize and understand the particle-hole physics of Klein tunneling in bounded Dirac systems, and also shed light on potential applications for manipulating particle-hole hybridized spinor waves.</description>

Abstract: Coherent states are a well-established tool of quantum optics to describe electromagnetic waves in terms of photons. However, they do not describe the near-field regime of radiation sources. Instead, we generically use classical solutions of Maxwell's equations to describe radiation in the near-field regime. The classical solutions provide linear relations between currents and emitted electromagnetic fields, whereas evolution of states at the quantum level proceeds through unitary time evolution operators involving photon operators. This begs questions how the classical radiation equations relate to unitary quantum evolution, and how we can describe macroscopic fields from antennas or magnetic coils in terms of elementary photons. The present paper answers both questions through the construction of generalized Glauber states for radiation emitters.</description>

      <title>Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.</description>

Abstract: The overlap integrals of scattering states in potentials of finite widths are expressed with their asymptotic behaviors and those of energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ consist of diagonal terms that are proportional to $\delta(E_1-E_2)$ and nondiagonal terms. Owing to the composition of nondiagonal terms, superpositions of stationary states have time-dependent norms and finite probability currents. These do not represent isolate states. In various exceptional potentials and in free theory, nondiagonal terms do not exist, and the superpositions of states with different energies represent isolate particles that exactly describe scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fault-Tolerant Single Qubit Gate Approximation And Universal Quantum Computation Without Using The Solovay-Kitaev Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arbitrarily accurate fault-tolerant (FT) universal quantum computation can be carried out using the Clifford gates Z, S, CNOT plus the non-Clifford T gate. Moreover, a recent improvement of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem by Kuperberg implies that to approximate any single-qubit gate to an accuracy of $\epsilon &gt; 0$ requires $\text{O}(\log^c[1/\epsilon])$ quantum gates with $c &gt; 1.44042$. Can one do better? That was the question asked by Nielsen and Chuang in their quantum computation textbook. Specifically, they posted a challenge to efficiently approximate single-qubit gate, fault-tolerantly or otherwise, using $\Omega(\log[1/\epsilon])$ gates chosen from a finite set. Here I give a partial answer to this question by showing that this is possible using $\text{O}(\log[1/\epsilon] \log\log[1/\epsilon] \log\log\log[1/\epsilon] \cdots)$ FT gates chosen from a finite set depending on the value of $\epsilon$. The key idea is to construct an approximation of any phase gate in a FT way by recursion to any given accuracy $\epsilon &gt; 0$. This method is straightforward to implement, easy to understand, and interestingly does not involve the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid state quantum emitters are a prime candidate in distributed quantum technologies since they inherently provide a spin-photon interface. An ongoing challenge in the field, however, is the low photon extraction due to the high refractive index of typical host materials. This challenge can be overcome using photonic structures. Here, we report the integration of V2 centers in a cavity-based optical antenna. The structure consists of a silver-coated, 135 nm thin 4H-SiC membrane functioning as a planar cavity with a broadband resonance yielding a theoretical photon collection enhancement factor of 34. The planar geometry allows us to identify over 20 single V2 centers at room temperature with a mean (maximum) count rate enhancement factor of 9 (15). Moreover, we observe 10 V2 centers with a mean absorption linewidth below 80MHz at cryogenic temperatures. These results demonstrate a photon collection enhancement that is robust to the lateral emitter position.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary Coupled Cluster Enabled by Mid-circuit Measurements on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms rely on a quality initial state for optimal performance. Preparing an initial state for specific applications can considerably reduce the cost of probabilistic algorithms such as the well studied quantum phase estimation (QPE). Fortunately, in the application space of quantum chemistry, generating approximate wave functions for molecular systems is well studied, and quantum computing algorithms stand to benefit from importing these classical methods directly into a quantum circuit. In this work, we propose a state preparation method based on coupled cluster (CC) theory, which is a pillar of quantum chemistry on classical computers, by incorporating mid-circuit measurements into the circuit construction. Currently, the most well studied state preparation method for quantum chemistry on quantum computers is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a unitary-CC with single- and double-electron excitation terms (UCCSD) ansatz whose operations are limited to unitary gates. We verify the accuracy of our state preparation protocol using mid-circuit measurements by performing energy evaluation and state overlap computation for a set of small chemical systems. We further demonstrate that our approach leads to a reduction of the classical computation overhead, and the number of CNOT and T gates by 28% and 57% on average when compared against the standard VQE-UCCSD protocol.</description>

      <title>Witnessing network steerability of every bipartite entangled state without inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum steering is an asymmetric form of quantum nonlocality where one can detect whether a measurement on one system can steer or change another distant system. It is well-known that there are quantum states that are entangled but unsteerable in the standard quantum steering scenario. Consequently, a long-standing open problem in this regard is whether the steerability of every entangled state can be activated in some way. In this work, we consider quantum networks and focus on the swap-steering scenario without inputs and find linear witnesses of network steerability corresponding to any negative partial transpose (NPT) bipartite state and a large class of bipartite states that violate the computable cross-norm (CCN) criterion. Furthermore, by considering that the trusted party can perform tomography of the incoming subsystems, we construct linear inequalities to witness swap-steerability of every bipartite entangled state. Consequently, for every bipartite entangled state one can now observe a form of quantum steering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating a family of Markovian master equations that can be realized through a probabilistic application of unitary channels and state preparation. Our approach employs a second-order product formula for the Lindblad master equation, achieved by decomposing the dynamics into dissipative and Hamiltonian components and replacing the dissipative segments with randomly compiled, easily implementable elements. The sampling approach eliminates the need for ancillary qubits to simulate the dissipation process and reduces the gate complexity in terms of the number of jump operators. We provide a rigorous performance analysis of the algorithm. We also extend the algorithm to time-dependent Lindblad equations, generalize the noise model when there is access to limited ancillary systems, and explore applications beyond the Markovian noise model. A new error bound, in terms of the diamond norm, for second-order product formulas for time-dependent Liouvillians is provided that might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Cross-talk is a well-known feature of single-photon avalanche detectors. It is especially important to account for this effect in applications involving coincidences of two or more photons registered by the sensor since in this case the cross-talk may mimic the useful signal. In this work, we characterize the cross-talk of the LinoSPAD2 detector, as well as perform joint measurements of the cross-talk and Hanbury Brown - Twiss two-photon interference, comparing and cross-calibrating both effects. With a median dark count rate of 125 cps/pixel, we report the average cross-talk probability of $0.22~\%$ for the nearest neighbor and also observe a long-range cross-talk of the order $2 \cdot 10^{-5}~\%$ for channels separated by up to 20 pixels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay rate of quantum particles in open quantum systems has traditionally been known as exponential, based on empirical predictions from experiments and theoretical predictions from the Markovian dynamics of the corresponding quantum states. However, both theoretical predictions and experimental observations suggest deviations from this exponential decay, particularly in the short and long time regimes. In this study, we explore the spontaneous emission of a single Dirac particle within an environment characterized by an energy spectrum with a gap $m$ and an energy cutoff $L$. Our results reveal that high-energy structures, such as the spectral cutoff $L$, play a critical role in driving the short-time non-exponential decay. In contrast, the long-time decay is predominantly influenced by low-energy structures, such as the Dirac gap $m$. Surprisingly, we find that in the limits where the energy cutoff $L$ is infinite and the energy gap $m$ is zero, the decay dynamics of massless Dirac particles exhibit Markovian behavior without the need for conventional approximations like the Born-Markov approximation. This work underscores the complex interplay between particle energy properties and decay dynamics, providing new insights into quantum decay processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating complex spin systems, known for high frustration and entanglement, presents significant challenges due to their intricate energy landscapes. This study focuses on the $J_{1}-J_{2}$ Heisenberg model, renowned for its rich phase behavior on the square lattice, to investigate strongly correlated spin systems. We conducted the first experimental quantum computing study of this model using the 127-qubit IBM Rensselear Eagle processor and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. By employing classical warm-starting ($+40\%$ ground state energy approximation) and a newly developed ansatz ($+9.31\%$ improvement compared to prior best), we improved ground state approximation accuracy on the 16-site variant, achieving usable results with approximately $10^{3}$ iterations, significantly fewer than the $10^{4}-10^{5}$ steps proposed by previous theoretical studies. We utilized existing error mitigation strategies and introduced a novel Classically-Reinforced VQE error mitigation scheme, achieving $93\%$ ground state accuracy, compared to $83.7\%$ with the Quantum Moments algorithm and $60\%$ with standard error mitigation. These strategies reduced the average error of observable prediction from $\approx 20\%$ to $5\%$, enhancing phase prediction from qualitative to quantitative alignment. Additionally, we explored an experimental implementation of the Quantum Lanczos (QLanczos) algorithm using Variational-Fast Forwarding (VFF) on a 4-qubit site, achieving $\approx 97\%$ ground state approximation. Theoretical simulations indicated that Krylov-based methods outperform VQE, with the Lanczos basis converging faster than the real-time basis. Our study demonstrates that near-term quantum devices can predict phase-relevant observables for the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model, transitioning focus from theoretical to experimental, and suggesting general improvements to VQE-based methods.</description>

      <title>ML-Powered FPGA-based Real-Time Quantum State Discrimination Enabling Mid-circuit Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similar to reading the transistor state in classical computers, identifying the quantum bit (qubit) state is a fundamental operation to translate quantum information. However, identifying quantum state has been the slowest and most susceptible to errors operation on superconducting quantum processors. Most existing state discrimination algorithms have only been implemented and optimized "after the fact" - using offline data transferred from control circuits to host computers. Real-time state discrimination is not possible because a superconducting quantum state only survives for a few hundred us, which is much shorter than the communication delay between the readout circuit and the host computer (i.e., tens of ms). Mid-circuit measurement (MCM), where measurements are conducted on qubits at intermediate stages within a quantum circuit rather than solely at the end, represents an advanced technique for qubit reuse. For MCM necessitating single-shot readout, it is imperative to employ an in-situ technique for state discrimination with low latency and high accuracy. This paper introduces QubiCML, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based system for real-time state discrimination enabling MCM - the ability to measure the state at the control circuit before/without transferring data to a host computer. A multi-layer neural network has been designed and deployed on an FPGA to ensure accurate in-situ state discrimination. For the first time, ML-powered quantum state discrimination has been implemented on a radio frequency system-on-chip FPGA platform. The deployed lightweight network on the FPGA only takes 54 ns to complete each inference. We evaluated QubiCML's performance on superconducting quantum processors and obtained an average accuracy of 98.5% with only 500 ns readout. QubiCML has the potential to be the standard real-time state discrimination method for the quantum community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.10893v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) is a model of quantum computation, which uses local measurements instead of unitary gates. Here we explain that the MBQC procedure has a fundamental basis in an underlying gauge theory. This perspective provides a theoretical foundation for global aspects of MBQC. The gauge transformations reflect the freedom of formulating the same MBQC computation in different local reference frames. The main identifications between MBQC and gauge theory concepts are: (i) the computational output of MBQC is a holonomy of the gauge field, (ii) the adaptation of measurement basis that remedies the inherent randomness of quantum measurements is effected by gauge transformations. The gauge theory of MBQC also plays a role in characterizing the entanglement structure of symmetry-protected topologically (SPT) ordered states, which are resources for MBQC. Our framework situates MBQC in a broader context of condensed matter and high energy theory.</description>

      <title>An Order Relation between Eigenvalues and Symplectic Eigenvalues of a Class of Infinite-Dimensional Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain some results in the direction of ``infinite dimensional symplectic spectral theory". We prove an inequality between the eigenvalues and symplectic eigenvalues of a special class of infinite dimensional operators. Let $T$ be an operator such that $T - \alpha I$ is compact for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. Denote by $\{{\lambda_j^R}^\downarrow(T)\}$, the set of eigenvalues of $T$ lying strictly to the right side of $\alpha$ arranged in the decreasing order and let $\{{\lambda_j^L}^\uparrow(T)\}$ denote the set of eigenvalues of $T$ lying strictly to the left side of $\alpha$ arranged in the increasing order. Furthermore, let $\{{d_j^R}^\downarrow(T)\}$ denote the symplectic eigenvalues of $T$ lying strictly to the right of $\alpha$ arranged in decreasing order and $\{{d_j^L}^\uparrow(T)\}$ denote the set of symplectic eigenvalues of $T$ lying strictly to the left of $\alpha$ arranged in increasing order, respectively (such an arrangement is possible as it will be shown that the only possible accumulation point for the symplectic eigenvalues is $\alpha$). Then we show that $${d_j^R}^\downarrow(T) \leq {\lambda_j^R}^\downarrow(T), \quad j = 1,2, \cdots, s_r$$ and $${\lambda_j^L}^\uparrow(T) \leq {d_j^L}^\uparrow(T), \quad j = 1,2, \cdots, s_l,$$ where $s_r$ and $s_l$ denote the number of symplectic eigenvalues of $T$ strictly to the right and left of $\alpha$, respectively. This generalizes a finite dimensional result obtained by Bhatia and Jain (J. Math. Phys. 56, 112201 (2015)). The class of Gaussian Covariance Operators (GCO) and positive Absolutely Norm attaining Operators ($(\mathcal{A}\mathcal{N})_+$ operators) appear as special cases of the set of operators we consider.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electromagnetic response for Hall effect in time-reversal breaking materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that materials with broken time-reversal symmetry can have Hall response. Here we show that in addition to the conventional currents, a new type of nonlinear Hall current can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a novel dipole associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking materials by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.</description>

      <title>Absorbing State Phase Transition with Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of quantum fluctuations in modifying the critical behavior of non-equilibrium phase transitions is a fundamental but unsolved question. In this study, we examine the absorbing state phase transition of a 1D chain of qubits undergoing a contact process that involves both coherent and classical dynamics. We adopt a discrete-time quantum model with states that can be described in the stabilizer formalism, and therefore allows for an efficient simulation of large system sizes. The extracted critical exponents indicate that the absorbing state phase transition of this Clifford circuit model belongs to the directed percolation universality class. This suggests that the inclusion of quantum fluctuations does not necessarily alter the critical behavior of non-equilibrium phase transitions of purely classical systems. Finally, we extend our analysis to a non-Clifford circuit model, where a tentative scaling analysis in small systems reveals critical exponents that are also consistent with the directed percolation universality class.</description>

      <title>A class of 2 X 2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of 2 X 2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions that are imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present model, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2 X 2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Structure and scaling of Kitaev chain across a quantum critical point in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) is applied to the Kitaev chain with inhomogeneous pairing interactions that vanish in half of the lattice and result in a quantum critical point separating the superfluid and normal-gas phases in real space. The weakly-interacting BCS theory predicts scaling behavior of the penetration of the pair wavefunction into the normal-gas region different from conventional power-law results due to the non-analytic dependence of the BCS order parameter on the interaction. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation produces numerical results confirming the scaling behavior and hints complications in the strong-interaction regime. The limiting case of the step-function quench shows the dominance of the BCS coherence length in absence of additional length scale. Furthermore, the energy spectrum and wavefunctions from the BdG equation show abundant in-gap states from the normal-gas region in addition to the topological edge states.</description>

      <title>An optically defined phononic crystal defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a mechanical crystal with an optically programmable defect mode. By applying an optical spring to a single unit cell of a phononic crystal membrane, we smoothly transfer a single mechanical mode into the bandgap, thereby localizing its spatial profile from one spanning the entire crystal to one confined within a few unit cells. This localization is evidenced by an enhanced mechanical frequency shift commensurate with a 37-fold reduction in the mode's participating mass. Our results lay groundwork for a new class of optomechanical systems that control mechanical mode profile and participating mass.</description>

      <title>Braiding Fibonacci anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Parity Detectors: a qubit based particle detection scheme with meV thresholds for rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of rare-event searches, such as those aimed at determining the nature of particle dark matter or in measuring fundamental neutrino properties, will benefit from particle detectors with thresholds at the meV scale, 100-1000x lower than currently available. Quantum parity detectors (QPDs) are a novel class of proposed quantum devices that use the tremendous sensitivity of superconducting qubits to quasiparticle tunneling events as their detection concept. As envisioned, phonons generated by particle interactions within a crystalline substrate cause an eventual quasiparticle cascade within a surface patterned superconducting qubit element. This process alters the fundamental charge parity of the device in a binary manner, which can be used to deduce the initial properties of the energy deposition. We lay out the operating mechanism, noise sources, and expected sensitivity of QPDs based on a spectrum of charge-qubit types and readout mechanisms and detail an R&amp;D pathway to demonstrating sensitivity to sub-eV energy deposits.</description>

      <title>Rise and Fall of Anderson Localization by Lattice Vibrations: A Time-Dependent Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intricate relationship between electrons and the crystal lattice is a linchpin in condensed matter, traditionally described by the Fr\"ohlich model encompassing the lowest-order lattice-electron coupling. Recently developed quantum acoustics, emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations, has enabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron-lattice interaction not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, which are later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fr\"ohlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning techniques for designing materials with tailored electron-lattice properties.</description>

      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>
