      <title>Vibe Coding Kills Open Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is changing how software is produced and used. In vibe coding, an AI agent builds software by selecting and assembling open-source software (OSS), often without users directly reading documentation, reporting bugs, or otherwise engaging with maintainers. We study the equilibrium effects of vibe coding on the OSS ecosystem. We develop a model with endogenous entry and heterogeneous project quality in which OSS is a scalable input into producing more software. Users choose whether to use OSS directly or through vibe coding. Vibe coding raises productivity by lowering the cost of using and building on existing code, but it also weakens the user engagement through which many maintainers earn returns. When OSS is monetized only through direct user engagement, greater adoption of vibe coding lowers entry and sharing, reduces the availability and quality of OSS, and reduces welfare despite higher productivity. Sustaining OSS at its current scale under widespread vibe coding requires major changes in how maintainers are paid.</description>

      <title>Do people expect different behavior from large language models acting on their behalf? Evidence from norm elicitations in two canonical economic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While delegating tasks to large language models (LLMs) can save people time, there is growing evidence that offloading tasks to such models produces social costs. We use behavior in two canonical economic games to study whether people have different expectations when decisions are made by LLMs acting on their behalf instead of themselves. More specifically, we study the social appropriateness of a spectrum of possible behaviors: when LLMs divide resources on our behalf (Dictator Game and Ultimatum Game) and when they monitor the fairness of splits of resources (Ultimatum Game). We use the Krupka-Weber norm elicitation task to detect shifts in social appropriateness ratings. Results of two pre-registered and incentivized experimental studies using representative samples from the UK and US (N = 2,658) show three key findings. First, people find that offers from machines - when no acceptance is necessary - are judged to be less appropriate than when they come from humans, although there is no shift in the modal response. Second - when acceptance is necessary - it is more appropriate for a person to reject offers from machines than from humans. Third, receiving a rejection of an offer from a machine is no less socially appropriate than receiving the same rejection from a human. Overall, these results suggest that people apply different norms for machines deciding on how to split resources but are not opposed to machines enforcing the norms. The findings are consistent with offers made by machines now being viewed as having both a cognitive and emotional component.</description>

      <title>Bundling and Price-Matching in Competitive Complementary Goods Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mixed bundling and competitive price-matching guarantees (PMGs) in a duopoly selling complementary products to heterogeneous customers. One retailer offers mixed bundling while the rival sells only a bundle. We characterize unique pure-strategy Nash equilibria across subgames and compare them to a no-bundling benchmark. Mixed bundling strictly dominates whenever an equilibrium exists. Conditional on bundling, PMG adoption trades off strategic demand capture against margin losses on loyal customers and varies systematically with relative demand responsiveness to prices and complementarities.</description>

      <title>Can Rising Consumption Deepen Inequality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of rising consumption on wealth inequality remains an open question. Here we revisit and extend the Social Architecture of Capitalism agent-based model proposed by Ian Wright, which reproduces stylized facts of wealth and income distributions. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the macroscopic behavior of the model is predominantly governed by a single dimensionless parameter, the ratio between average wealth per capita and mean salary, denoted by R. The shape of the wealth distribution, the emergence of a two-class structure, and the level of inequality -- summarized by the Gini index -- were found to depend mainly on R, with inequality increasing as R increases. In the present work, we examine the robustness of this result by relaxing some simplifying assumptions of the model. We first allow transactions such as purchases, salary payments, and revenue collections to occur with different frequencies, reflecting the heterogeneous temporal dynamics of real economies. We then impose limits on the maximum fractions of wealth that agents can spend or collect at each step, constraining the amplitude of individual transactions. We find that the dependence of the inequality on R remains qualitatively robust, although the detailed distribution patterns are affected by relative frequencies and transaction limits. Finally, we analyze a further variant of the model with adaptive wages emerging endogenously from the dynamics, showing that self-organized labor-market feedback can either stabilize or amplify inequality depending on macroeconomic conditions.</description>

      <title>The Software Complexity of Nations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the growing importance of the digital sector, research on economic complexity and its implications continues to rely mostly on administrative records, e.g. data on exports, patents, and employment, that have blind spots when it comes to the digital economy. In this paper we use data on the geography of programming languages used in open-source software to extend economic complexity ideas to the digital economy. We estimate a country's software economic complexity index (ECIsoftware) and show that it complements the ability of measures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research to account for international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and emissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of relatedness, meaning that a country's entries and exits in programming languages are partly explained by its current pattern of specialization. Together, these findings help extend economic complexity ideas and their policy implications to the digital economy.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Regularized HARX to Measure Volatility Spillovers in Multi-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify volatility spillovers across commodities, equities, and treasuries using a hybrid HAR-ElasticNet framework on daily realized volatility for six futures markets over 2002--2025. Our two step procedure estimates own-volatility dynamics via OLS to preserve persistence, then applies ElasticNet regularization to cross-market spillovers. The sparse network structure that emerges shows equity markets (ES, NQ) act as the primary volatility transmitters, while crude oil (CL) ends up being the largest receiver of cross-market shocks. Agricultural commodities stay isolated from the larger network. A simple univariate HAR model achieves equally performing point forecasts as our model, but our approach reveals network structure that univariate models cannot. Joint Impulse Response Functions trace how shocks propagate through the network. Our contribution is to demonstrate that hybrid estimation methods can identify meaningful spillover pathways while preserving forecast performance.</description>

      <title>Implementing Optimal Taxation: A Constrained Optimization Framework for Tax Reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While optimal taxation theory provides clear prescriptions for tax design, translating these insights into actual tax codes remains difficult. Existing work largely offers theoretical characterizations of optimal systems, while practical implementation methods are scarce. Bridging this gap involves designing tax rules that meet theoretical goals, while accommodating administrative, distributional, and other practical constraints that arise in real-world reform. We develop a method casting tax reform as a constrained optimization problem by parametrizing the entire income tax code as a set of piecewise linear functions mapping tax-relevant inputs into liabilities and marginal rates. This allows users to impose constraints on marginal rate schedules, limits on income swings, and objectives like revenue neutrality, efficiency, simplicity, or distributional fairness that reflect both theoretical and practical considerations. The framework is computationally tractable for complex tax codes and flexible enough to accommodate diverse constraints, welfare objectives and behavioral responses. Whereas existing tools are typically used for ex-post `what-if' analysis of specific reforms, our framework explicitly incorporates real-world reform constraints and jointly optimizes across the full tax code. We illustrate the framework in several simulated settings, including a detailed reconstruction of the Dutch income tax system. For the Dutch case, we generate a family of reforms that smooth existing spikes in marginal tax rates to any desired cap, reduce the number of rules, and impose hard caps on income losses households can experience from the reform. We also introduce \texttt{TaxSolver}, an open-source package, allowing policymakers and researchers to implement and extend the framework.</description>
