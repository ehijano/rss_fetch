      <title>Spectral Fredholm Theory in Von Neumann Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Fredholm theory in von Neumann algebras established by Breuer in [5] and [6] to spectral Fredholm theory. We consider 2 by 2 upper triangular operator matrices with coefficients in a von Neumann algebra and give the relationship between the generalized essential spectra in the sense of Breuer of such matrices and of their diagonal entries. Next, we prove that if a generalized Fredholm operator in the sense of Breuer has 0 as an isolated point of its spectrum, then the corresponding spectral projection is finite. Finally, we define the generalized B-Fredholm operator in a von Neumann algebra as a generalization in the sense of Breuer of the classical B-Fredholm operators on Hilbert and Banach spaces. We provide sufficient conditions under which a sum of a generalized B-Fredholm operator and a finite operator in a von Neumann algebra is again a generalized B-Fredholm operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, quantum subgroups in finite free products of the Pontryagin duals of free unitary quantum groups are classified. They correspond to pairs of a subgroup $\Gamma$ and a subset $S$ of the free group $\mathbb{F}_n$ such that $S$ is $\Gamma$-invariant, containing $\Gamma$, and connected in the Cayley graph of $\mathbb{F}_n$</description>

      <title>Commutant of sum of two quasihomogeneous Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major open question in the theory of Toeplitz operator on the Bergman space of the unit disk of the complex plane is to fully characterize the set of all Toeplitz operators that commute with a given one. In [2], the second author described the sum $S = T_{e^{im\theta}f} +T_{e^{il\theta}g}$, where $f$ and $g$ are radial functions, that commutes with the sum $T = T_{e^{ip\theta}r(2M+1)p} +T_{e^{is\theta}r(2N+1)s}$ . It is proved that $S = cT$, where $c$ is a constant. In this article, we shall replace $r^{(2M+1)p}$ and $r^{(2N+1)s}$ by $r^n$ and $r^d$ respectively, with $n$ and $d$ in $\mathbb{N}$, and we shall show that the same result holds.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of intertwining operators over generalized convolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\sf G}$ be a locally compact group, $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}{\sf G}$ a Fell bundle and $\mathfrak B=L^1({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ the algebra of integrable cross-sections associated to the bundle. We give conditions that guarantee the automatic continuity of intertwining operators $\theta:\mathcal X_1\to\mathcal X_2$, where $\mathcal X_1$ is a Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule and $\mathcal X_2$ is a weak Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule, in terms of the continuity ideal of $\theta$. We provide examples of algebras where this conditions are met, both in the case of derivations and algebra morphisms. In particular, we show that, if ${\sf G}$ is infinite, finitely-generated, has polynomial growth and $\alpha$ is a topologically free (partial) action of ${\sf G}$ on the compact space $X$, then every homomorphism of $\ell^1_\alpha({\sf G},C(X))$ into a Banach algebra is automatically continuous.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimal transport for approximately finite-dimensional $C^{*}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.03312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce quantum optimal transport of states on tracial AF-$C^{*}$-algebras to study non-spatial transport of quantum information, and view it as the pointwise case of a general parametrised one. We define quantum optimal transport distances as dynamic transport distances in a tracial but non-ergodic and infinite-dimensional quantum setting, called AF-$C^{*}$-setting. We further extend foundational results of Carlen and Maas to the AF-$C^{*}$-setting and develop a theory of quantum optimal transport yielding non-spatial lower Ricci bounds suitable for meaningful geometric analysis. Essential for our discussion is a coarse graining process arising from the underlying metric geometry as encoding scheme of the given tracial AF-$C^{*}$-algebra. In the logarithmic mean setting, we apply the coarse graining process to show equivalence of the EVI$_{\lambda}$-gradient flow property for quantum relative entropy, its strong geodesic $\lambda$-convexity, a, possibly infinite-dimensional, Bakry-\'Emery condition, and a Hessian lower bound condition. We then define lower Ricci bounds of our quantum gradients using any one of said equivalent conditions, give sufficient conditions for lower Ricci bounds of direct sum quantum gradients and, assuming lower Ricci bounds, derive functional inequalities HWI$_{\lambda}$, MLSI$_{\lambda}$ and TW$_{\lambda}$ in the AF-$C^{*}$-setting alongside their chain of implications. Fundamental example classes give quantum optimal transport of normal states on hyperfinite factors of type I and II with both non-negative and strictly positive lower Ricci bounds. An application is given by first and second quantisation of spectral triples.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of tracial positive maps and applications in quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every positive multilinear map between $C^*$-algebras is separately weak$^*$-continuous. We show that the joint weak$^*$-continuity is equivalent to the joint weak$^*$-continuity of the multiplications of $C^*$-algebras under consideration. We study the behavior of general tracial positive maps on properly infinite von Neumann algebras and by applying the Aron--Berner extension of multilinear maps, we establish that under some mild conditions every tracial positive multilinear map between general $C^*$-algebras enjoys a decomposition $\Phi=\varphi_2 \circ \varphi_1$, in which $\varphi_1$ is a tracial positive linear map with the commutative range and $\varphi_2$ is a tracial completely positive map with the commutative domain. As an immediate consequence, tracial positive multilinear maps are completely positive. Furthermore, we prove that if the domain of a general tracial completely positive map $\Phi$ between $C^*$-algebra is a von Neumann algebra, then $\Phi$ has a similar decomposition. As an application, we investigate the generalized variance and covariance in quantum mechanics via arbitrary positive maps. Among others, an uncertainty relation inequality for commuting observables in a composite physical system is presented.</description>

      <title>Smooth Cartan triples and Lie twists over Hausdorff \'etale Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how to recover a Lie structure on a twist over a Hausdorff \'etale groupoid from functional-analytic data in the spirit of Connes' reconstruction theorem for manifolds. We first characterise when a smooth structure on the unit space of a Hausdorff \'etale groupoid can be extended to a Lie-groupoid structure on the whole groupoid. We introduce Lie twists over Hausdorff Lie groupoids, building on Kumjian's notion of a twist over a topological groupoid. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a family of sections of a twist over a Lie groupoid under which the twist can be made into a Lie twist so that all the specified sections are smooth. We use these results in the setting of twists over \'etale groupoids to describe conditions on a Cartan pair of C*-algebras and a family of normalisers of the subalgebra, under which Renault's Weyl twist for the pair can be made into a Lie twist for which the given normalisers correspond to smooth sections.</description>

      <title>Quantum Automorphism Group of Direct Sum of Cuntz Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1998, Wang constructed an ergodic action of the compact quantum group $U_n^+$ (free unitary quantum group) on the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_n$. Later, in 2018-2019, S. Joardar and A. Mandal showed that the quantum automorphism group of the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_{n}$ (as a graph $C^*$-algebra) is $U_n^+$ in the category introduced by them.
  In this article, we explore the quantum symmetry of the direct sum of Cuntz algebras viewing them as a graph $C^*$-algebra in the category as mentioned before.
  It has been shown that the quantum automorphism group of the direct sum of non-isomorphic Cuntz algebras $\{\mathcal{O}_{n_i}\}_{i=1}^{m}$ is ${U}_{n_1}^{+}*{U}_{n_2}^{+}* \cdots *{U}_{n_m}^{+}$ for distinct $n_i$'s, i.e. if $ L_{n_i}$ (the graph contains $n_i$ loops based at a single vertex) is the underlying graph of $\mathcal{O}_{n_i}$, then
  \begin{equation*}
  Q_{\tau}^{Lin}(\sqcup_{i=1}^{m} ~ L_{n_i}) \cong *_{i=1}^{m} ~~ Q_{\tau}^{Lin}(L_{n_i}) \cong {U}_{n_1}^{+}*{U}_{n_2}^{+}* \cdots *{U}_{n_m}^{+}.
  \end{equation*}
  Moreover, the quantum symmetry of the direct sum of $m$ copies of isomorphic Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_n$ (whose underlying graph is $L_n$) is $U_n^+ \wr_* S_m^+,$ i.e.
  \begin{equation*}
  Q_{\tau}^{Lin}(\sqcup_{i=1}^{m} ~ L_n) \cong Q_{\tau}^{Lin}(L_n) \wr_* S_m^+ \cong U_n^+ \wr_* S_m^+.
  \end{equation*}
  On the other hand, it is known that the quantum automorphism group of $m$ disjoint copies of a simple, connected graph $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the free wreath product of the quantum automorphism group of $\Gamma$ with $S_m^+$. Though an analoguous result is true for $\mathcal{O}_{n}$ (as a graph $C^*$-algebra), we have provided a counter-example to show that this result is not in general true for an arbitrary graph $C^*$-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a homotopy theorist's point of view on $KK$- and $E$-theory for $C^{*}$-algebras. We construct stable $\infty$-categories representing these theories through a sequence of Dwyer-Kan localizations of the category of $C^{*}$-algebras. Thereby we will reveal the homotopic theoretic meaning of various classical construction from $C^{*}$-algebra theory, in particular of Cuntz' $q$-construction. We will also discuss operator algebra $K$-theory in this framework.</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with a uniform version of amenability is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

      <title>Log-majorization and matrix norm inequalities with application to quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with log-majorization for matrices in connection with the multivariate Golden--Thompson trace inequality and the Karcher mean (i.e., a multivariate extension of the weighted geometric mean). We show an extension of Araki's log-majorization and apply it to the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence in quantum information. We discuss the equality cases in the multivariate trace inequality of Golden--Thompson type and in the norm inequality for the Karcher mean. The paper includes an appendix to correct the proof of the author's old result on the equality case in the norm inequality for the weighted geometric mean.</description>

      <title>Characterization of ($\alpha$,$\alpha$)-derivation on $B(X)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Banach algebra and $B(X)$ be the set of all bounded linear operators on $X$. Suppose that $\alpha: B(X) \rightarrow B(X)$ is an automorphism. We say that a mapping $\delta$ from $B(X)$ into itself is derivable at $G \in B(X)$ if $\delta(G) = \alpha(A)\delta(B) + \delta(A)\alpha(B)$ for all $A, B \in B(X)$ with $AB = G$. We say that an element $G \in B(X)$ is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-all derivable point of $B(X)$ if every $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivable mapping $\delta$ at G is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivation. In this paper, we show that every $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivable mapping at a nonzero element in $B(X)$ is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivation.</description>
