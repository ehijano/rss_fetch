      <title>Further correction to the STARFORGE methods paper: Planck-mean dust opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model for the Planck-mean dust opacity $\kappa_{P}$ given in Appendix C of the STARFORGE simulations methods paper does not extrapolate well to low radiation temperature $T_{\rm rad}$, so we provide an updated calculation suitable for general use. We also clarify the role of the dust and radiation temperatures in setting the dust opacity, and provide code and calculations of the Planck- and Rosseland- mean dust opacity as a function of both the dust temperature $T_{\rm d}$ and the radiation temperature $T_{\rm rad}$.</description>

      <title>Trading oxygen for iron II. Oxygen- versus iron-dependent cosmic star formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their different nucleosynthetic origin, a stellar population produces oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) on different timescales and their relative abundance can deviate strongly from solar. Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived &lt;[Fe/H]&gt; from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers).</description>

      <title>Fossil group origins XIV: The radial orbits of A267</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fossil groups (FGs) are groups or clusters of galaxies with a single, massive, central galaxy and with a clear lack of L* galaxies. The physical reason for their large magnitude gap (dm12) may arise from early FG formation, which allowed all L galaxies to merge with the central one, and/or it could be related to the fact that galaxies accreting on the FGs move on radial orbits, shortening their merging timescales. The latter properties could be linked with the peculiar position of FGs within the cosmic web. We determine the velocity anisotropy profile beta(r) of the fossil cluster A267, which is related to the orbital distribution of cluster galaxies. This is the first individual FG for which the orbital distribution of galaxies is determined. We aim to confirm previous findings based on stack samples that indicate that FGs, on average, host galaxies on more radial orbits than normal clusters. We started with a sample of 2315 redshifts in the field of A267 and we determined the membership for 329 of them. Of these, 174 are located within r200. We used them as tracers of the gravitational potential of the cluster to solve the Jeans equation using the MAMPOSSt algorithm. We thus obtained the cluster mass M(r) and beta(r) profiles. We also estimated M(r) from the X-ray data. A comparison of the MAMPOSSt and X-ray-determined M(r)s allows us to estimate the cluster hydrostatic mass bias, that is consistent with previous findings. The anisotropy parameter beta(r) indicates tangential orbits for the galaxies near the cluster centre and increasingly radial orbits in the external regions. We therefore confirm that FGs are characterised by more radial orbits for their member galaxies than the average cluster population. We speculate that this different orbital distribution might be an important element in creating a large dm12.</description>

      <title>Do z&gt;6 quasars reside in protoclusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of a sample of z&gt;6 bright (bolometric luminosity L$_{\rm bolo}$&gt;10$^{46.25}$ erg/s) Quasars drawn from a realization of the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model coupled with the Planck Millennium Simulation. We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z&gt;6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 $h^{-1}$ cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L$_{\rm bolo}$&gt;10$^{44}$ erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated. The large field-to-field variance in the the number of companions (both active and non-active) recently reported from JWST observations is fairly well reproduced by GAEA predictions. Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters. Viceversa, GAEA predicts that only a small fraction of Bright Central Galaxies have a bright z&gt;6 QSOs among their progenitors. Our results suggest that luminous high-z QSO loosely trace the progenitors of low-z galaxy clusters, and that additional information about the environment of high-z QSOs are required to identify the most promising proto-cluster candidates.</description>

      <title>Electron densities from [S II] lines significantly overestimate the impact of ionised AGN outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explain the properties of the local galaxy population, theoretical models require active galactic nuclei (AGN) to inject energy into host galaxies, thereby expelling outflows of gas that would otherwise form stars. Observational tests of this scenario rely on determining outflow masses, which requires measuring the electron density ($n_e$) of ionised gas. However, recent studies have argued that the most commonly used diagnostic may underestimate electron densities (and hence overestimate outflow masses) by several orders of magnitude, casting doubt as to whether ionised AGN-driven outflows can provide the impact needed to reconcile observations with theory. Here, we investigate this by applying two different electron-density diagnostics to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy of the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample of 48 nearby type-2 quasars. Accounting for uncertainties, we find that outflow masses implied by the transauroral-line electron-density diagnostic are significantly lower than those produced by the commonly-used `strong-line' [S II](6717/6731) method, indicating a different origin of these emission lines and suggesting that these doubts are justified. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to modify the [S II](6717/6731) electron-density diagnostic for our sample by applying a correction of $\mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,\, outflow}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) = \mathrm{log}_{10}(n_{e\mathrm{,[S\,II]}}\mathrm{ [cm}^{-3}\mathrm{]}) + 0.75(\pm0.07)$ to account for this, which results in values that are statistically consistent with those produced using the transauroral-line method. The techniques that we present here will be crucial for outflow studies in the upcoming era of large spectroscopic surveys, which will also be able to verify our results and broaden this method to larger samples of AGN of different types.</description>

      <title>A first look at a complete view of spatially resolved star formation at 1&lt;z&lt;1.8 with JWST NGDEEP+FRESCO slitless spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [abridged] The previously inaccessible star formation tracer Pa$\alpha$ can now be spatially resolved by JWST NIRCam slitless spectroscopy in distant galaxies up to cosmic noon. In the first study of its kind, we combine JWST NGDEEP NIRISS and FRESCO NIRCam slitless spectroscopy to provide the first direct comparison of spatially resolved dust-obscured (traced by Pa$\alpha$) versus unobscured (traced by H$\alpha$) star formation across the main sequence. We stack Pa$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ emission-line maps, along with stellar continuum images at both wavelengths of 31 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.8 in three bins of stellar mass. Surface brightness profiles are measured and equivalent width (EW) profiles computed. Increasing Pa$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ EW profiles with galactocentric radius across all stellar masses probed provide direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies both via dust-obscured and unobscured star formation for the first time. For galaxies on the main sequence, a weakly positive ($0.1\pm0.1$) Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ line profile as a function of radius is found at $8.8\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&lt;9.9$ with a negative ($-0.4\pm0.1$) Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ line profile found at $9.9\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&lt;11.0$. Low mass galaxies ($7.7\leqslant\mathrm{log}(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&lt;8.8$) with high sSFRs are found to have a negative ($-0.5\pm0.1$) Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ line profile gradient. Our results demonstrate that while inside-out growth via star formation is ubiquitous across the main sequence just after cosmic noon, centrally concentrated dust attenuation is not. Along with other recent work in the literature, our findings motivate future studies of resolved SFR profiles in large samples of individual cosmic noon galaxies across the main sequence, to understand the intrinsic scatter in spatially resolved star formation.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey VI. The collapse of the galaxy HI Mass Function in Fornax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the deepest HI mass Function (HIMF) ever measured, outside the Local Group. The observations are part of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and cover a 4 x 4 deg^2 field, corresponding to ~ Rvir. The 3$\sigma$ detection limit is log(MHI/Msun) = 5.7 for a 50 km/s-wide point source. We detect HI in 35 galaxies and 44 clouds with no optical counterparts. Using deep optical images from the Fornax Deep Survey, we show that the clouds are a distinct population, separated by a four magnitude gap from the faintest HI-detected galaxies. The majority (33 out of 44) of the clouds are associated with the two galaxies with the most HI in the cluster -- NGC 1365 and NGC 1427A, although the clouds contribute a negligible amount to the total MHI budget. By performing a SNR analysis and computing the Rauzy statistic on the HI detections, we demonstrate that our catalogue is complete down log(MHI/Msun) = 6, and we are therefore able to probe the HIMF down to this level. We find an abrupt drop of the number density of HI-detected galaxies at log(MHI/Msun) = 7, signifying a clear absence of galaxies between 6 &lt; log(MHI/Msun) &lt; 7. We use the modified maximum likelihood method to fit a Schechter function down to log(MHI/Msun) &gt; 7, the range where the HIMF follows a power-law. The measured low-mass slope is $\alpha$ = -1.31 $\pm$ 0.13, with a characteristic knee mass of log(M*/Msun) = 10.52 $\pm$ 1.89. The low-mass slope matches the slope in the field, while the knee is defined by a single galaxy and is unconstrained. Below log(MHI/Msun) = 7, there is a sharp departure from a Schechter function, and we report the first robust measurement of the collapse of a HIMF. For the HIMF below log(MHI/Msun) = 7 to follow a power-law, tens of galaxies are needed -- a factor ~ six higher than what is observed. The collapse of the Fornax HIMF is likely due to the rapid removal of HI from low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Universal depletion of metal-poor globular clusters in inner galaxy regions: Fossil record of black hole retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the spatial distribution of globular cluster (GC) systems across 37 host galaxies in a two dimensional parameter space defined by projected galactocentric distance Rg and metallicity Fe/H. We identified a universal triangular depleted region characterized by a lack of metal poor GCs in the inner parts of host galaxies. The morphology of this depleted region correlates with the luminous mass of the host galaxies; more massive galaxies consistently exhibit more extended depleted regions. We attribute this phenomenon to the combined influence of large scale galactic assembly and internal GC dynamics, particularly the initial retention of black holes within GCs. Metal poor GCs contain a more massive and compact black hole subsystem, which drives more energetic few body encounters and injects greater kinetic energy into the stellar population. This extra energy, combined with strong tidal forces in central galactic regions, accelerates the dissolution of low metallicity GCs, producing the triangular depleted pattern in the Rg - Fe/H space. Stronger tidal fields in more massive galaxies confine surviving metal poor GCs to larger radii, broadening the depleted region. The morphology of this region may serve as a potential distance indicator for host galaxies. Our results also suggest that scenarios with substantial black hole natal kicks are unlikely, as too few retained black holes would erase the metallicity dependent cluster dissolution required to form the observed depletion region.</description>

      <title>The abundance and properties of the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way: Insights from Semi-Analytic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and observable properties of faint satellite galaxies (M$_\rm V &gt; -3$) in Milky Way-like halos using the semi-analytic galaxy formation model Galacticus. The ability of the smallest dark matter halos to form stars depends sensitively on the balance between gas cooling and reionization heating. To quantify how this balance shapes the abundance and properties of the faintest galaxies, we compare two model variants: a fiducial model that includes molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling and UV background radiation, and a No-H$_2$ model with atomic cooling only. Both models reproduce the structural properties of brighter Milky Way satellites, but they diverge at the lowest luminosities in the hyper-faint regime. The fiducial model predicts a substantially larger population of such systems that are on average hosted in halos with lower peak masses and quenched earlier. Many of these predicted systems lie below current observational thresholds but are within reach of next-generation deep imaging surveys. The predicted size-luminosity distributions of both models overlap with the region occupied by recently discovered "ambiguous" systems, whose classification as galaxies or star clusters remains uncertain. Specifically, we find that hyper-faint satellites have line-of-sight velocity dispersions of $\sigma_{\rm los} \sim 1-3$ km/s in the fiducial model, nearly an order of magnitude higher than expected for purely self-gravitating stellar systems of the same stellar mass. This distinction underscores the diagnostic power of precise kinematic measurements for determining whether ambiguous objects are dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies or star clusters, and highlights the importance of upcoming spectroscopic campaigns in resolving the nature of the faintest satellites.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Chemical Enrichment in the Abell 2029 Core with XRISM, XMM-Newton, and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the chemical abundance pattern in the core of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell~2029, based on XRISM observations with Resolve (37 ks) and Xtend (500 ks), combined with archival data from XMM-Newton (EPIC, RGS) and Chandra. Fe abundances derived from Resolve, Xtend, and EPIC are broadly consistent, while RGS gives systematically lower values. Because the XRISM gate valve remained closed during these observations, Resolve spectral fitting is restricted to the 2--10 keV band, providing reliable constraints only for elements with strong lines in this band (S, Ar, Ca, Fe, Ni). Abundances of the $\alpha$-elements are therefore derived using complementary observations from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra. We construct an average X/Fe pattern in the cluster core by using Resolve exclusively for S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe, and RGS + Xtend for O/Fe. The Ne/Fe ratio is averaged from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra measurements; Mg/Fe from EPIC and Chandra measurements; and Si/Fe from Xtend, EPIC, and Chandra. Comparison with the supernovae yield models indicates that the observed abundance pattern in A2029 core is best reproduced by a combination of core-collapsed yields from low-metallicity progenitors ($Z_{\rm init}=0.001$) and a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass, double-degenerate Type Ia model. Additionally, we find an excess in Ca abundance in the core of A2029 that cannot be reproduced by the standard supernovae yield models.</description>

      <title>Revised optical classification of a sample of gamma-ray emitting AGN with GTC and VLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of the optical follow-up of a sample of $\gamma$-ray-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). New high-quality optical spectra were obtained using Gran Telescopio Canarias with Optical System for Imaging and low- Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy and the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 1 with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2. From the analysis of these spectra, we confirmed the previous classification as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) for four objects and discovered two new NLS1s, bringing the total number of optically confirmed $\gamma$-NLS1s to 26. We also identified two ambiguous cases between NLS1 and intermediate Seyfert (IS), three IS, one broad-line Seyfert 1, one Seyfert 2. Based on the new spectra, we calculated black hole masses ranging from $10^{6.25}$ to $10^{9.32}$ $M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios spanning 0.05 to 2.07. This reclassification reinforces the scenario in which AGN with relatively small black hole masses are capable of launching powerful relativistic jets, contributing to our broader understanding of $\gamma$-ray-emitting AGN.</description>

      <title>Mean Mass Density near the Sun from the Divergence Theorem and Pulsar Accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new, non-parametric method for estimating the mass enclosed within a sphere of arbitrary radius centered on the Sun. The method is based on the divergence theorem as applied to measurements of the line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars. We describe a procedure for inferring the mean mass density within a sphere of a given radius centered on the Sun and find results that are consistent with previous analyses. When combined with a model for the distribution of baryons, this provides the mean mass density of dark matter as a function of distance from the Sun, rather than a single value as is typically reported by kinematic studies. However, with the present pulsar data, the method cannot unambiguously measure a signal from the local distribution of dark matter at this time; such a measurement is expected to soon become possible as the amount of pulsar acceleration data grows and its precision improves. We derive an extension of the well-known shell theorem to a spherical-harmonics expansion of the density and potential, and use the result to obtain estimates for density asymmetries with respect to the Galactic midplane from the observed acceleration data. The predicted asymmetries do not follow the observed distribution of MW disk stars or gas; this can potentially be explained by a non-uniform distribution of dark matter in the Solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>CLASSY XIII. Cutting through the Clouds - Comparing Indirect Tracers of Ionizing Photon Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) provides critical insights into the role of early galaxies in shaping the ionization state of the universe. However, because of the opacity of the intergalactic medium, it is often not possible to make direct measurements of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$) of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies. To explore the agreement and systematics of common indirect approaches, we applied six empirically calibrated diagnostics to predict $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\: \mathrm{LyC}}$ for the 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). These methods- based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines, the UV continuum slope, Ly$\alpha$ kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission line ratios- enable us to explore systematic differences between predictions and assess how galactic properties influence inferred LyC escape. Despite significant variations in method predictions, there is broad consistency in the resulting weak and strong LyC leaker classifications, with approximately half exhibiting predicted escape fractions $&gt;$1%. We find evidence for two different pathways of LyC escape in nearby star-forming galaxies: (1) an early escape model driven by very young stellar populations, and (2) a delayed escape model that is consistent with supernova-driven outflows and time-dependent ISM clearing. The early escape model is favored among galaxies with a single, intense burst of recent star formation. In contrast, the delayed escape model is common among galaxies with more extended starburst histories. To interpret ionizing photon escape during the EoR, it will be necessary to recognize and understand this diversity in LyC escape mechanisms.</description>

      <title>JWST observations of cosmic-ray-excited H$_2$ in Barnard 68: spatial variations and constraints on cosmic-ray attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of the starless dark cloud Barnard 68 that reveal the spatially-resolved signature of cosmic-ray excited molecular hydrogen (CRXH$_2$) emissions for the first time. Following up on our initial detection of CRXH$_2$ emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH$_2$ rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH$_2$ and UV-pumped H$_2$ components, we isolate the para-H$_2$-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH$_2$ line intensity to the line-of-sight H$_2$ column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of $N({\rm H}_2) = 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, we infer $\zeta_{\rm H_2} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\approx 3$ higher than the average value derived from H$_3^+$ absorption studies. These results provide the most direct probe to date of cosmic-ray penetration into cold, dense gas, offering new constraints on both the microphysics of CR-H$_2$ interactions and the attenuation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds. Our findings establish CRXH$_2$ emission as a powerful new diagnostic of the cosmic-ray environment in interstellar space.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: The $i$-band galaxy luminosity function from the present-day to $z = 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the $i$-band galaxy luminosity function from the present-day to $z = 2$, using over 1.1 million galaxies from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). PAUS combines broad-band imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey with narrow-band photometry from PAUCam, enabling high-precision photometric redshifts with an accuracy of $\sigma_{68} (\Delta z) = 0.019$ down to $i_{\textrm{AB}} = 23$. A synthetic lightcone mock catalogue built using the \texttt{GALFORM} semi-analytic model is used to simulate PAUS selection effects and photometric uncertainties, and to derive a machine-learning based estimate of the $k$-correction. We recover rest-frame $i$-band luminosities using a random forest regressor trained on simulated $ugriz$ photometry and redshifts. Luminosity functions are estimated using the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method, accounting for photometric redshift and magnitude errors, and validated against mock data. We find good agreement between observations and models at $z &lt; 1$, with increasing discrepancies at higher redshifts due to photometric redshift outliers. The bright-end of the luminosity function becomes flatter at high redshift, primarily driven by redshift errors. We show that the faint-end of the luminosity function becomes more incomplete with increasing redshift, but is still useful for constraining models. We analyze the red and blue galaxy populations separately, observing distinct evolutionary trends. The model overpredicts the number of both faint red and blue galaxies. Our study highlights the importance of accurate redshift estimation and selection modeling for robust luminosity function recovery, and demonstrates that PAUS can characterise the galaxy population with photometric redshifts across a wide redshift baseline.</description>

      <title>Large gas inflow driven by a matured galactic bar in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bar structures are present in about half of local disk galaxies and play pivotal roles in secular galaxy evolution. Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation to the rotating disk and transport gas inward to feed central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole. They are believed to be long-lived structures and are now identified at redshift $z&gt;2$. Yet, little is known about the onset and effect of bars in the early cosmic epoch because spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here, we report a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observe the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and find the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funneling molecular gas into its center at a rate of $\approx600$ solar masses per year. Our results show that bar-driven dynamical processes and secular evolution were already at play 11.1 billion years ago, powering active star formation amid the gas-rich and far-infrared luminous growth phase in a massive disk galaxy.</description>

      <title>Too Quiet for Comfort: Local Little Red Dots Lack Variability over Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several local ($z\lesssim 0.2$) metal-poor dwarf AGNs have remarkably similar properties to those of high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs), and are recently proposed to be local analogs of LRDs. We use long-term photometric and spectroscopic observations of three local LRDs spanning $\sim 20$ years to measure variability in their rest-frame optical continuum and broad H$\alpha$ emission lines. Using ZTF light curves over a rest-frame $\sim 5$ yr baseline, the $r$-band intrinsic rms variability is $(9\times 10^{-5})_{\rm -9E-5}^{+0.014}$ mag (J1022), $0.025\pm0.004$ mag (J1025) and $0.020\pm0.005$ mag (J1047), indicating low intrinsic variability ($&lt;3-4\%$ at 3$\sigma$). These rms variability amplitudes are much lower than those for dwarf AGNs and more massive quasars. There is little structure in the optical variability structure functions for the three local LRDs, in contrast to normal AGN variability. Using available multi-epoch spectra, we constrain the broad H$\alpha$ line flux variability to be less than a few percent, without significant profile changes, over a rest-frame baseline of $\sim 15$ yrs in J1025 and J1047, respectively. The three LRDs stand out in the Balmer line properties compared with normal broad-line AGNs, with exceptionally large H$\alpha$ equivalent widths and H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. In the context of recent theoretical models of LRDs as dense gas-enshrouded massive black holes with super-Eddington accretion, our results suggest that the photosphere emission is long-term stable and the broad Balmer lines are primarily collisonally excited. This scenario is consistent with the lack of variability, large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios and little dust extinction, as well as the expected high gas density. Virial black hole mass estimates using broad H$\alpha$ assuming photoionization are therefore highly questionable for LRDs.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution of bulges of active galactic nuclei in the early Universe: roles of accreting stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST/NIRCam observations reveal dense stellar cores in high-redshift galactic bulges, indicative of sustained star formation and potential stellar accretion. We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z&gt;15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges.</description>

      <title>MAMMOTH-Grism: Revisiting the Mass-Metallicity Relation in Protocluster Environments at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present one of the first measurements of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) in multiple massive protoclusters at cosmic noon, using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) G141 slitless spectroscopy from the MAMMOTH-Grism survey. We identify 63 protocluster member galaxies across three overdense structures at $z = 2\text{-}3$ with robust detections of [OIII], H$\beta$, and [OII] emission. The sample spans gas-phase metallicities of $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.2\text{-}8.6$, dust-corrected H$\beta$-based star formation rates (SFRs) of $10$-$250\,M_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, and stellar masses of $M_\ast \sim 10^{9.4}$-$10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, derived via spectral energy distribution fitting using deep HST and ground-based photometry. We stack spectra in five $M_\ast$ bins to obtain average metallicities and SFRs. Relative to field galaxies at similar redshifts, protocluster members show elevated SFRs at $M_\ast &lt; 10^{10.25}\,M_\odot$ and a systematically shallower MZR: $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = (6.96 \pm 0.13) + (0.143 \pm 0.017) \times \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})$. We detect a mass-dependent environmental offset: massive protocluster galaxies are metal-poor compared to field counterparts of similar mass, whereas lower-mass systems exhibit comparable or mildly enhanced metallicities. This trend is consistent with a scenario where cold-mode accretion dilutes the interstellar medium (ISM) across the full mass range, while efficient recycling of feedback-driven outflows preferentially enriches the ISM in low-mass galaxies. Finally, we assess the dependence of metallicity offsets on local overdensity and find no significant trend, likely reflecting the survey's bias toward protocluster cores.</description>

      <title>Two Epochs of VLBI Observations of 8 KISSR Seyfert &amp; LINER Galaxies: Suggestions of Fast and Filamentary Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here the results from a second epoch of phase-referenced VLBA observations of 8 Seyfert and LINER galaxies from the KISSR sample. These sources were chosen based on the presence of double peaks or asymmetries in their emission lines as observed in SDSS spectra. Parsec-scale radio emission is detected in 7 of the 8 sources in the second epoch. Jet-like features appear to persist over a $\sim4-9$ year timeline in these `radio-quiet' AGN. A few sources like KISSR1494, however, show significantly different structures after a 9 year interval. KISSR102, which was previously suggested to be a binary black hole candidate based on the presence of two compact cores, shows the tentative signatures of superluminal jet motion ($1.05\pm0.45$c). Tentative superluminal motion in a jet knot has been reported in another source, KISSR872 ($1.65\pm0.57$c). We present 1.5 GHz images from the VLA A-array of 4 sources. These images reveal core-lobe or core-halo structures. The alignment of the VLBI jet direction with the kpc-scale spectral index gradient, as well as the mismatch between the star formation rate derived from the radio and H$\alpha$ line emission, support the suggestion that the kpc-scale emission is AGN-jet-related. The jets in KISSR sources appear to lose collimation over spatial scales between 200 parsec and 1 kpc. Overall, the characteristics of the KISSR jets are reminiscent of similar properties observed in VLBI monitoring studies of `radio-loud' AGN jets even as subtle differences related to the compactness and brightness of jet features remain.</description>

      <title>Hidden Metallic Iron in Amorphous Silicate Dust? Insights from Condensation Experiments and Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous silicate dust is a major component in the interstellar and circumstellar dust formed in the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.</description>

      <title>Can Wolf-Rayet stars be the missing ingredient to explain high-z He II ionizing radiation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are hot, massive stars with depleted hydrogen. At low metallicities (Z), WN3-type WR stars have relatively thin winds and are major sources of ionizing flux. The detection of high-ionization emission lines in high-redshift ($z$) galaxies as well as nearby low-Z dwarf galaxies raises questions about the origin of He II ionizing radiation and its role in galaxy evolution, as stellar population models fail to reproduce the required fluxes. Low-Z WN3 stars may provide the missing contribution but are easily hidden in integrated light. Using the Local Volume Mapper, we compare resolved optical spectra of SMC WN3 stars with integrated regions, focusing on the broad He II $\lambda4686\,\AA$ line. We find stellar emission diluted within nebular regions, becoming undetectable when integrating over areas larger than 24 pc. Nonetheless, these stars emit enough ionizing photons to explain observed He II nebular emission, being strong candidates for the He II ionizing sources in low-Z and high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Environmental Invariance of the Galaxy Size-Mass Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy size-luminosity and size-stellar mass relations are important constraints on the galactic baryon cycle of gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. There are conflicting claims in the literature regarding how environment influences size: both direct transformative effects and `assembly bias' may contribute to observed variations with environment. We construct a large homogeneous sample of size measurements to M*~10^7 Msun. Our sample fills a gap in field galaxy size measurements around 10^7-10^8 Msun; the literature at these masses is biased towards satellites of L* galaxies and members of galaxy clusters. We use sizes from the DESI-LS, together with a published catalog that contains stellar masses and cluster positions derived from DESI-LS photometry. Our sample extends to z&lt;0.3 and comprises 540,228 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and 9,513,732 galaxies with photometric redshifts. We explore the environmental dependence of size for a mass-limited subset of our sample at z&lt;0.05, based on distance to the nearest cluster center. We obtain size-luminosity and size-mass relations in good agreement with previous studies. By separating galaxies according to color and morphology, we show that the environmental variation of the overall size-mass relation on Mpc scales can be understood as the consequence of a changing mixture of subpopulations, rather than direct size transformation. For example, at fixed mass, quiescent (red) late-type galaxies within 2Mpc of a cluster have the same size as quiescent late-type galaxies 30Mpc from the nearest cluster. Our results support individual galaxy assembly histories as the primary determinant of galaxy size. The existence of significantly different, environment-insensitive size mass relations for subpopulations separated by color and Sersic index provides a clear target for calibration of the baryon cycle in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Collision frequency between dark matter subhaloes within Milky Way-like galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, sub-galactic structures hierarchically collide and merge to build up larger structures. Mergers and collisions between dwarf galaxies and dark matter subhaloes (DMSHs) play an important role in the evolution and formation of structures within a massive galaxy. We investigate the collision frequency between DMSHs associated with a massive host galaxy such as the Milky Way. We analytically estimate the density distribution of DMSH pairs for the relative distance and relative velocity ($r_\mathrm{rel}$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$) and the distance from the centre of the host halo and relative velocity ($r$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$) planes, based on the distribution function of the host halo in the phase space. Then, we evaluate the collision frequencies of DMSHs by integrating the orbital evolution of DMSHs in Milky-Way-like host haloes selected from cosmological $N$-body simulations. The frequency of violent encounters, in which the relative distance of DMSHs is shorter than the sum of scale radii, is averaged as $2.1\times 10^2\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$. Since the time scale of violent encounters, $4.7\,\mathrm{Myr}$, is shorter than the dynamical time of the host halo, collisions between DMSHs occur frequently within the host halo. Although interactions between DMSHs produce pairs with higher relative velocities, the density distributions of all and colliding pairs between DMSHs provided by numerical results are approximately similar to those of the analytical model neglecting the interactions of DMSHs on $r_\mathrm{rel}$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$ plane for all pairs and $r$-$v_\mathrm{rel}$ plane for colliding pairs. We compare our results with observed colliding dwarf galaxies and provide insight into the abundance of DMSHs.</description>

      <title>The ensemble broad-frequency power spectrum of Stripe-82 quasars from multiple surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability is a striking features of quasars, observed at all timescales wavelengths. Studying its properties and the correlations with the physical parameters (e.g. black hole mass and accretion rate) provides significant insights into accretion physics. However, the detailed picture and the exact interplay between different emitting regions are not yet clear. We combine data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1, PS1), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Gaia space telescope to constrain the power spectrum of quasars in the Stripe-82 region over a broad frequency range, 10^{-1} to 10^{-3} day^{-1}(rest frame). Light curves are matched and cross-calibrated to reach \sim 20 years in the r-band for 4037 quasars. We split the sample into bins of the same black hole mass, accretion rate, and redshift, and measure the ensemble power spectral density (PSD) in each bin. The power spectra of SDSS, ZTF, and Gaia are measured independently. We do not measure it on PS1 data due to more erratic cadence, but we discuss the use of interpolation techniques, eventually allowing us to use the data together. We find significant evidence that the long-term UV/optical variability of quasars is stationary, as the ensemble PSD estimates from SDSS, Gaia and ZTF are consistent within the errors despite coming from different surveys and years. The PSD shape is consistent with a bending power law with spectral indices of -2.7 and -1 at high and low frequencies. A fit with the PSD associated with a damped random walk is significantly worse. The PSD amplitude below the break does not depend on black hole mass, but there is some evidence for anti-correlation with the accretion rate. The bending frequency, instead, scales with the black hole mass as $\nu_b$ \propto M_{\mathrm{BH}}^{-0.6\pm0.1} and does not depend on the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>A Unified Analytic Framework for Microlensing Caustics: Geode Solutions and Hyper--Catalan Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a preparation-invariant analytic description of image formation near microlensing caustics. After a local Weierstrass preparation at any multiple image (order $d\ge2$), the lens mapping reduces to a single geode variable $m$ satisfying $m=U\,\varphi(m)$, where $U$ is a prepared source coordinate and $\varphi$ is an image-side kernel. The coefficients of $m(U)$ obey closed Hyper-Catalan (HC) recurrences, allowing termwise derivatives and truncation control from the characteristic system. We also use the same form for a short HC predictor-corrector: evaluate the series within its certified radius and apply a brief Newton polish near the boundary. We define an HC signature (first nonzero kernel coefficients) and an HC spectrum (branch points and analyticity radius $\rho_U$), which quantify sparsity, stiffness, and safe evaluation domains. The construction covers folds and cusps of any global degree. On a binary fold and cusp, an artificial decic with a resonant unit, and two triple-lens cusps of a challenging geometry, HC seeds plus a few Newton steps recover the exact images to machine precision within the certified domain and maintain continuity under continuation. The resulting single-series templates (with $(\mathrm{Sig}_R,\rho_U)$ metadata) are ready for photometric and astrometric modeling.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Radio Sky: Bayesian Ensemble Learning and SVD-Based Feature Extraction for Automated Radio Galaxy Classification</title>

Abstract: The classification of radio galaxies is central to understanding galaxy evolution, active galactic nuclei dynamics, and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, traditional manual techniques are inadequate for processing the massive, heterogeneous datasets generated by modern radio surveys. In this study, we present a probabilistic machine learning framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction with Bayesian ensemble learning to achieve robust, scalable radio galaxy classification. The SVD approach effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving key morphological structures, enabling efficient representation of galaxy features. To mitigate class imbalance and avoid the introduction of artefacts, we incorporate a Local Neighbourhood Encoding strategy tailored to the astrophysical distribution of galaxy types. The resulting features are used to train and optimize several baseline classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons within bagging, boosting, and stacking ensembles governed by a Bayesian weighting scheme. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian ensembles outperform their traditional counterparts across all metrics, with the Bayesian stacking model achieving a classification accuracy of 99.0% and an F1-score of 0.99 across Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR-I), and Type II (FR-II) sources. Interpretability is enhanced through SHAP analysis, which highlights the principal components most associated with morphological distinctions. Beyond improving classification performance, our framework facilitates uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable integration into next-generation survey pipelines. This work contributes a reproducible and interpretable methodology for automated galaxy classification in the era of data-intensive radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type II Cepheids are a class of pulsating variable stars that play a critical role in our understanding of stellar evolution, distance measurement and tracing the structure and kinematics of old stars in nearby galaxies. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of research on Type II Cepheids, including their observed properties, pulsation mechanisms and their distinction from other variable stars. These pulsating variable stars, found primarily in older stellar populations, exhibit well-defined period-luminosity relations but with an added advantage that they exhibit weak or negligible dependence on metallicity. We explore their relevance in the context of their role as distance indicators and potential calibrators of the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Finally, the review highlights recent advancements in theoretical models, observations across different wavelengths and ongoing debates concerning their classification.</description>

      <title>A pilot VLBI study of the SQUAB quasar sample featuring multiple Gaia detections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our previous work identified a class of SDSS quasars exhibiting multiple Gaia detections, classifying them as candidates for various astrophysical systems such as quasar-star pairs, dual quasars, and gravitationally lensed quasars. In this paper, we present a pilot VLBI study targeting a radio-bright subsample and report the first high-resolution imaging results. By leveraging the milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI and its precise astrometric coordination incorporating with Gaia, we aim to refine the classification of these multiple matched sources, search for potential dual AGNs, and assess the efficacy of the combined Gaia-VLBI approach in resolving ambiguous quasar systems. We cross-matched the SQUAB quasar sample with the FIRST and NVSS catalogs, identifying 18 radio-emitting sources. The three brightest were selected for dual-frequency (1.6 and 4.9 GHz) VLBA observations. We performed VLBI imaging at both Gaia positions, constructed spectral index maps, and estimated brightness temperatures to characterize the radio morphology and physical properties. For the three target sources, our VLBI observations reveal compact radio structures consistent with single AGN at the primary Gaia positions. No significant emission is detected at the secondary Gaia locations. These results support the interpretation of the sources as quasar$-$star pairs, in line with earlier studies. This pilot study demonstrates the value of radio-VLBI high-resolution follow-ups on Gaia-selected quasar systems with multiple counterparts, showing how they can unambiguously reveal the true nature of these systems and help remove contaminants from dual AGN candidate samples.</description>

      <title>Dynamical simulation of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT by NASA Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), with a v$_{\infty}$ $\sim$ 58 kms$^{-1}$. This is the fastest among the three interstellar objects discovered so far. In this work, we study the interaction of the 3I/ATLAS with Mars, pre-perihelion, and Jupiter post-perihelion. We also present the results of the dynamical simulations of the orbital evolution of the comet for a hundred years in the past and future. For our analysis, we have used REBOUND, an N-Body simulation package, to study these situations. We use the adaptive size mathematical integrator \textsc{Ias15}, with a 1-day time step for long-term integration, and a 1-hour time step to study the effect of the planets on this body during the close encounters. We have seen an effect of Jupiter on the orbital parameters of the comet, which affects its post-perijove trajectory significantly. The impact of Mars on this comet is minimal compared to the effect of Jupiter. This is consistent with the point that the comet moves well past Mars's Hill radius but very close to Jupiter's Hill radius at the respective close approaches. However, the effect of non-gravitational forces will alter the results. Since the non-gravitational forces are not yet known, we predict the variation of the orbital parameters considering a range of possible magnitudes of the non-gravitational acceleration.</description>

      <title>Tracing Early Cosmic Chemical Enrichment: A Uniform XMM-Newton Survey of Metallicity in Galaxy Groups and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed metal abundances in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy groups and clusters, $Z_{ICM}$, exceed what is expected from present-day stellar populations alone. Galaxy clusters are presumed to be near closed-box systems, allowing constraints to be placed on the origins of metals and stellar populations responsible for $Z_{ICM}$. We present a uniform XMM-Newton survey of 26 galaxy groups and clusters, measuring radial metallicity profiles and relating $Z_{ICM}$ with the stellar fraction $M_*/M_{gas}$. We determine $Z_{ICM}$ via spectral fitting across multiple annuli finding a best fit of $Z_{ICM} = -0.08^{+0.07}_{-0.07}\, log\left(\frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right) + 0.30^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ with intrinsic scatter $\sigma_p = 0.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$. We use closed-box chemical evolution models to estimate the metallicity yield from observable stellar populations, incorporating updated supernova yields and corrections for metals locked in remnants, $Z_* = (1.14 \pm 0.52) \, log\left(1 + \frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right)$. Our results demonstrate that present-day stellar populations systematically underpredict $Z_{ICM}$, with an inferred excess component increasing in systems with low $M_*/M_{gas}$. This trend supports the need for an early enrichment population (EEP) distinct from visible stars, $Z_{EEP}$. We find this necessity holds when reconsidering the closed-box assumption by removing all galaxy groups, potential leaky systems, deriving $Z_{EEP}$ within $1\sigma$ when including and excluding groups. Three systems (NGC1132, NGC5098, and NGC4325) deviate from the survey trend, exhibiting steep negative radial metallicity gradients and unusually low $Z_{ICM}$. We posit these systems to be late-forming whose ICM enrichment reflects only recent stellar populations. Our analysis quantifies the necessity of an EEP and provides trends for testing cluster chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>Disc fragmentation. I. Ejection of Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past 25 years, observations have uncovered a large population of free-floating planets (FFPs), whose origins remain debated. Massive FFPs (several Jupiter masses or more) may form via gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, similar to stars. Lower-mass FFPs likely originate in planetary systems and are later ejected through dynamical interactions. We show that disc fragmentation in very young stellar binaries may be an abundant source of Jupiter-like FFPs (JFFPs), with masses above 0.3 Jupiter masses. In our model, disc fragmentation at tens to 100 au from the primary star produces gas giants, while fragmentation further out forms a more massive object that will eventually evolve into the secondary star. We present 3D simulations of massive, self-gravitating discs with embedded Jupiter-mass planets and a secondary seed ($5-50 M_J$). Chaotic migration leads to frequent planet-secondary interactions, imparting velocity kicks via gravitational slingshot that usually end in planet ejection. The ejection fraction increases steeply with the secondary-to-primary mass ratio, $q_s$, reaching 0.6 for $q_s &gt; 0.05$. Compared to Core Accretion JFFPs, disc fragmentation JFFPs: (i) form earlier, and may be more abundant in young clusters; (ii) are ejected at much lower velocities; (iii) may retain compact circum-planetary discs. To reproduce the observed abundance of JFFPs, disc fragmentation planets must be in the post-collapse configuration. They must also either form more frequently in binary systems than around single stars, or be frequently disrupted in inner disc regions, as previously suggested in certain versions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Compact Size, High $\Sigma$SFR: Defining Morphological Features of Ly$\alpha$-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanisms of Ly$\alpha$ photon escape are key to understanding galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization, yet remain poorly understood. We investigate the UV-continuum sizes of 23 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at Cosmic Noon ($1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.3$), extending previous size analyses to include fainter galaxies ($M_{\rm UV} \simeq -14$) using gravitational lensing. Our results show that these LAEs are unusually small for their luminosity, with a mean effective radius ($r_{\rm eff}$) of $170 \pm 140$ pc. They follow a distinct size-luminosity relation, with an intercept at $M_{\rm UV} = -21$ approximately three times smaller than typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at similar redshifts. This relation, however, is consistent with that of low-redshift Green Pea galaxies, suggesting that LAEs maintain compact sizes across redshifts. We also find that Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW(Ly$\alpha$)) increases with decreasing $r_{\rm eff}$, confirming previous findings. The small sizes of LAEs lead to high star formation surface densities ($\Sigma$SFR $= 1-600 M_{\odot} \ \rm{yr}^{-1} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), clearly separating them from typical SFGs in the $\Sigma$SFR vs. $r_{\rm eff}$ space. Given that high $\Sigma$SFR is linked to strong galactic outflows, our findings imply that compact morphology plays a key role in Ly$\alpha$ escape, likely facilitated by outflows that clear under-dense channels in the ISM. Thus, these results demonstrate that compact size and high $\Sigma$SFR can help identify Ly$\alpha$-emitters.</description>

We compare simulations with two different Pop III IMFs: $M_\text{char} = 10 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 100 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos10) and $M_\text{char} = 20 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 300 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos20). Aeos20 produces significantly more ionizing photons, ionizing 30% of the simulation volume by $z \approx 14$, compared to 9% in Aeos10. This enhanced ionization suppresses galaxy formation on the smallest scales. Differences in Pop III IMF also affect chemical enrichment. Aeos20 produces Population II (Pop II) stars with higher abundances, relative to iron, of light and $\alpha$-elements, a stronger odd-even effect, and a higher frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. The abundance scatter between different Pop II galaxies dominates the differences due to Pop III IMF, though, implying a need for a larger sample of Pop II stars to interpret the impact of Pop III IMF on early chemical evolution. We also compare the Aeos simulations to traditional simulations that use single stellar population particles. We find that star-by-star modeling produces a steeper mass-metallicity relation due to less bursty feedback. These results highlight the strong influence of the Pop III IMF on early galaxy formation and chemical evolution, emphasizing the need to account for IMF uncertainties in simulations and the importance of metal-poor Pop II stellar chemical abundances when studying the first stars.</description>

Abstract: The dynamical friction force acting on a spatially extended probe (globular clusters and dwarf galaxies) moving in the environment of ultralight bosonic dark matter in the state of the Bose-Einstein condensate is determined. Modeling the probe as a Plumer sphere of radius $l_p$, the radial and tangential components of the dynamic friction force are found in an analytic form, which reduce in the limit $l_p \to 0$ to the corresponding analytic expressions obtained in the literature in the case of a point probe. The dependence of the dynamical friction force on boson particle mass $m$ was analyzed and found to be non-monotonous in the interval $10^{-23} - 10^{-21}$eV.</description>

      <title>Stochastic star formation activity of galaxies within the first billion years probed by JWST</title>

Abstract: In this work, we aim at characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH in CIGALE using PSD, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce the SEDs of z&gt;6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies' physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each 6&lt;z&lt;12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (8.8&lt; logM*/Msun&lt;9.5), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.38+/-0.08 to 0.77+/-0.2 at z~6 and z~12, respectively. At all redshifts, only &lt;20% of low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty; although, this estimate is uncertain because their faintness leads to a low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of galaxies with a high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.28+/-0.06 to 0.38+/-0.11 between z~6 and z~9. We include additional constraints from observations on sigmaUV, the dispersion of the UV magnitude distribution, and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and 0.06+/-0.01 for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z&gt;10. Our results add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely responsible for the high-z UVLF. The stochastic SFH module is public as part of CIGALE version 2025.1.</description>

      <title>Converging on the Cepheid Metallicity Dependence: Implications of Non-Standard Gaia Parallax Recalibration on Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore &amp; Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.</description>

      <title>JWST spectroscopic confirmation of the Cosmic Gems arc at z=9.625 -- Insights into the small scale structure of a post-burst system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of the Cosmic Gems arc, strongly magnified by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615$-$5746. Six-hour integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution $\rm R\simeq 30-300$), covering the spectral range $0.8-5.3~\mu m$, reveals a pronounced $\rm Ly\alpha$-continuum break at $\lambda \simeq 1.3~\mu m$, as well as weak optical $\rm H\beta$ and $\rm [OIII]\lambda4959$ emission lines at $z=9.625\pm0.002$, located in the reddest part of the spectrum ($\lambda &gt; 5.1~\mu m$). No additional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak Balmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope ($\beta \leq-2.5$, $\rm F_{\lambda} \sim \lambda^{\beta}$). Spectral fitting with $\tt Bagpipes$ suggests that the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state. Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens of parsecs shows relatively uniform features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with the physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the stellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular, five observed star clusters exhibit ages of $\rm 7-30~Myr$. An updated lens model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent with star clusters ($\lesssim10$ pc) are identified along the extended tail of the arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line, lacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational, statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, using two samples of 2,170 and 1,329 systems with $M &gt; 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, selected from two publicly available group catalogs (\citet{2017A&amp;A...602A.100T} and \citet{2012ApJ...752...41Y}) constructed with two different algorithms and but both based primarily on SDSS galaxies. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find compelling statistical evidence for coherent rotation, as the observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution departs markedly from the randomized controls, exhibiting pronounced deviations near $380\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim360~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim693~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Quasar Radiative Feedback May Suppress Galaxy Growth on Intergalactic Scales at $z = 6.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at $z=6.3$. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a moderate but statistically significant decline in [O\,\textsc{iii}]\,$\lambda5008$ luminosity relative to the UV continuum ($L_{5008}/L_{1500}$) among galaxies within $\sim$ 7 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100$+$2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch ($M_{1450}=-29.26$). While $L_{1500}$ remains roughly constant with transverse distance, $L_{5008}$ increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile $\Gamma_{\mathrm{qso}}$. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in $L_{5008}/L_{1500}$ is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius ($\sim$ 7 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration $\sim$ 3.1 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H$_2$ photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Spectral survey of the diffuse gas toward BL Lac in the Q band</title>

Abstract: The chemical composition of diffuse interstellar clouds is not fully established. They host an active chemistry despite their relatively low density and the ubiquitous presence of far-UV radiation. To further explore the chemical composition of diffuse clouds, we performed a spectral scan toward the bright radio source BL Lac in the Q band (from 32 to 50 GHz) using the Yebes 40m telescope. Yebes observations were performed interleaving Frequency Switching and Position Switching integrations toward BL Lac, using a spectral resolution of 38 kHz. The data have been reduced with the CLASS software. We achieved an unprecedented sensitivity on the continuum of 0.02 - 0.07 %, allowing the detection of very faint absorption features. We confirm previous detections of HCS+, C3H, C3H+, CH3CN and HC3N in diffuse clouds and report new detections of CCS, C4H, CH3CHO, H2CCO , HNCO and H2CS along the line of sight to BL Lac, with abundances relative to H2 from a few 10{-11} to a few 10{-10}. We compiled molecular detections toward diffuse clouds to obtain the chemical inventory of a typical diffuse interstellar cloud. The chemical inventory of diffuse interstellar clouds includes complex organic species with up to four heavy atoms. These species are efficiently formed in the diffuse interstellar gas and reach abundances similar to those measured in dense photodissociation regions, pointing to similar gas phase chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in stellar streams induced by a galactic merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar streams are sensitive to perturbations from, e.g., giant molecular clouds, bars and spiral arms, infalling dwarf galaxies, or globular clusters which can imprint gaps, clumps, spurs, and asymmetries in tails. In addition to these effects, the impact of a galactic major merger on a population of stellar streams remains to be explored. Here, we focus on the emergence and longevity of asymmetries between the leading and trailing tails of streams caused by such interactions. We run collisionless N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy hosting 36 globular cluster streams and merging with a perturber galaxy. We propose a new asymmetry metric to quantify the structural differences between both tails from their respective cumulative density profiles. We find that the over- and under-densities along streams induced by the merger depend on the orbital characteristics of their progenitors. The non-simultaneity of this effect from stream to stream implies that global asymmetry signatures are less prominent than in individual cases. These population-averaged imprints remain detectable over only 2.5 Gyr but asymmetric signatures can persist over much longer periods for individual streams with wide orbits that have been perturbed prior to coalescence. We thus caution that the interpretation of streams' morphology in the context of dark matter mapping is strongly subject to degeneracies and should be performed considering the merger history of the host.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Protoclusters as Drivers of Cosmic Reionization: I. Bubble Overlap at Redshift z ~ 7 in LAGER-z7OD1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH). In the model, individual galaxy SFH is parametrized by Diffstar, which has parameters $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ that have a direct interpretation in terms of galaxy formation physics, such as star formation efficiency and quenching. DiffstarPop is a model for the statistical connection between $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ and the mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos. We have formulated DiffstarPop to have the minimal flexibility needed to accurately reproduce the statistical distributions of galaxy SFH predicted by a diverse range of simulations, including the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, the Galacticus semi-analytic model, and the UniverseMachine semi-empirical model. Our publicly available code written in JAX includes Monte Carlo generators that supply statistical samples of galaxy assembly histories that mimic the populations seen in each simulation, and can generate SFHs for $10^6$ galaxies in 1.1 CPU-seconds, or 0.03 GPU-seconds. We conclude the paper with a discussion of applications of DiffstarPop, which we are using to generate catalogs of synthetic galaxies populating the merger trees in cosmological N-body simulations.</description>

Abstract: Although frequently reported in observations, the definitive confirmation of high-mass prestellar cores has remained elusive, presenting a persistent challenge in star formation studies. Using two-band observational data from the 3mm ATOMS and 1.3mm QUARKS surveys, we report a high-mass prestellar core candidate, C2, located on the side of the bright-rimmed cloud IRAS 18290-0924. The C2 core identified from the 3mm continuum data of the ATOMS survey ($\sim$2 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 10000~au$ at 5.3 kpc) has a mass ranging from 27-68 $M_{\odot}$ for temperatures 10-22K within a radius of $\sim$2800 au. The highest-resolution ($\sim$0.3 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 1500 au$) observations of this source presented to date from the QUARKS survey reveal no evidence of further fragmentation. Further analysis of a total $\sim$10 GHz band width of molecular line survey does not find star-formation activity (e.g., outflows, ionized gas) associated with the core, with a few molecular lines of cold gas detected only. Additionally, virial analysis indicates the C2 core is gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} \sim0.1-0.3$) and thus could be undergoing collapse toward star formation. These results strongly establish a candidate for a high-mass prestellar core, contributing to the very limited number of such sources known to date.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the turbulent picture established by current numerical cosmological simulations. We use a high-resolution simulation of a Coma-like cluster and show that the simulation yields velocity structure functions and X-ray line-widths that are compatible with those measured by the XRISM observations of Coma. In particular, it has been previously suggested that a much steeper turbulence spectrum than the Kolmogorov would be needed to explain the XRISM observations under a homogeneous, cluster volume-filling turbulence model. Our results show that this tension is overcome thanks to the more complicated turbulent picture in cosmological simulations, that indeed shows a patchy distribution of turbulent regions in galaxy clusters, with a spectrum that is generally consistent with a Kolmogorov power-law over a fairly wide range of scales. More generally, our study highlights the fact that the interpretation of XRISM data of galaxy clusters depends on the turbulence model used and the importance of combining data and advanced simulations in the future steps.</description>

      <title>Unlocking 21cm Cosmology with SBI: A Beginner friendly NRE for Inference of Astrophysical Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the early Universe, yet extracting astrophysical parameters from its power spectrum remains a major challenge. We present a beginner-friendly PyTorch pipeline for Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE), a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that bypasses explicit likelihoods. Using 21cmFAST simulations, we show that MNRE can recover key astrophysical parameters such as the ionizing efficiency $\zeta$ and X-ray luminosity $L_X$ directly from power spectra. Our implementation prioritizes transparency and accessibility, offering a practical entry point for new researchers in 21-cm cosmology.</description>

      <title>Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.</description>

      <title>JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey IV: Stringent warm dark matter constraints from the joint reconstruction of extended lensed arcs and quasar flux ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\tt{galacticus}} ($N$-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), a 0.4 dex improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 &lt; m/M_{\odot}&lt;10^{10.7}$) of $1.7_{-1.2}^{+2.6} \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.9 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in mild tension with recent $N$-body simulations ($0.6 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.</description>

      <title>TIME Commissioning Observations: I. Mapping Dust and Molecular Gas in the Sgr A Molecular Cloud Complex at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the processing of an observation of Sagittarius A (Sgr A) with the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), part of the 2021-2022 commissioning run to verify TIME's hyperspectral imaging capabilities for future line-intensity mapping. Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $5.7 \times 10^5 M_\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys.</description>

      <title>Type Iax supernovae as a source of iron-rich silicate dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.</description>
