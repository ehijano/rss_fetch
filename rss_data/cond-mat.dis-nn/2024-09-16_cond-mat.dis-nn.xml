      <title>The thermodynamic limit in mean field neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last five decades, mean-field neural-networks have played a crucial role in modelling associative memories and, in particular, the Hopfield model has been extensively studied using tools borrowed from the statistical mechanics of spin glasses. However, achieving mathematical control of the infinite-volume limit of the model's free-energy has remained elusive, as the standard treatments developed for spin-glasses have proven unfeasible. Here we address this long-standing problem by proving that a measure-concentration assumption for the order parameters of the theory is sufficient for the existence of the asymptotic limit of the model's free energy. The proof leverages the equivalence between the free energy of the Hopfield model and a linear combination of the free energies of a hard and a soft spin-glass, whose thermodynamic limits are rigorously known. Our work focuses on the replica-symmetry level of description (for which we recover the explicit expression of the free-energy found in the eighties via heuristic methods), yet, our scheme is expected to work also under (at least) the first step of replica symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multifractal Critical Phases in Two-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multifractal critical phase (MCP) fundamentally differs from extended and localized phases, exhibiting delocalized distributions in both position and momentum spaces. The investigation on the MCP has largely focused on one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) quasiperiodic model with a MCP. We present its phase diagram and investigate the characteristics of the 2D system's MCP in terms of wave packet diffusion and transport based on this model. We further investigate the movement of the phase boundary induced by the introduction of next-nearest-neighbor hopping by calculating the fidelity susceptibility. Finally, we consider how to realize our studied model in superconducting circuits. Our work opens the door to exploring MCP in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Soft modes in vector spin glass models on sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the Hessian of low-lying minima of vector spin glass models defined on random regular graphs. We consider the two-component (XY) and three-component (Heisenberg) spin glasses at zero temperature, subjected to the action of a randomly oriented external field. Varying the intensity of the external field, these models undergo a zero temperature phase transition from a paramagnet at high field to a spin glass at low field. We study how the spectral properties of the Hessian depend on the magnetic field. In particular, we study the shape of the spectrum at low frequency and the localization properties of low energy eigenvectors across the transition. We find that in both phases the edge of the spectral density behaves as $\lambda^{3/2}$: such a behavior rules out the presence of a diverging spin-glass susceptibility $\chi_{SG}=\langle 1/\lambda^2 \rangle$. As to low energy eigenvectors, we find that the softest eigenmodes are always localized in both phases of the two models. However, by studying in detail the geometry of low energy eigenmodes across different energy scales close to the lower edge of the spectrum, we find a different behavior for the two models at the transition: in the XY case, low energy modes are typically localized; at variance, in the Heisenberg case low-energy eigenmodes with a multi-modal structure (sort of ``delocalization'') appear at an energy scale that vanishes in the infinite size limit. These geometrically non-trivial excitations, which we call Concentrated and Delocalised Low Energy Modes (CDLEM), coexist with trivially localised excitations: we interpret their existence as a sign of critical behavior related to the onset of the spin glass phase.</description>

      <title>Trade-off relations between quantum coherence and measure of many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence, a fundamental resource in quantum computing and quantum information, often competes with localization effects that affects quantum states in disordered systems. In this work, we prove exact trade-off relations between quantum coherence and a measure of localization and many-body localization, namely, the inverse participation ratio (IPR). We prove that the l1-norm of quantum coherence and the relative entropy of coherence for a pure quantum state satisfy complementarity relations with IPR. For a mixed state, IPR and the l2-norm of quantum coherence as well as relative entropy of coherence satisfy trade-off inequalities. These relations suggest that quantum coherence, in disordered quantum systems is also an ideal characterization of the delocalisation to many-body localisation transition, much like IPR, which is a well-known diagnostic of MBL. These relations also provide insight into the unusual properties of bipartite entanglement entropy across the MBL transition. We believe that these trade-off relations can help in better understanding of how coherence can be preserved or lost in realistic many-body quantum systems, which is vital for developing robust quantum technologies and uncovering new phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Spintronic Neuron Using a Magnetic Tunnel Junction for Low-Power Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spiking artificial neuron design based on a combined spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction (SV/MTJ). Traditional hardware used in artificial intelligence and machine learning faces significant challenges related to high power consumption and scalability. To address these challenges, spintronic neurons, which can mimic biologically inspired neural behaviors, offer a promising solution. We present a model of an SV/MTJ-based neuron which uses technologies that have been successfully integrated with CMOS in commercially available applications. The operational dynamics of the neuron are derived analytically through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation, demonstrating its ability to replicate key spiking characteristics of biological neurons, such as response latency and refractive behavior. Simulation results indicate that the proposed neuron design can operate on a timescale of about 1 ns, without any bias current, and with power consumption as low as 50 uW.</description>

      <title>A biology-inspired model for the electrical response of solid state memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristors stand out as promising components in the landscape of memory and computing. Memristors are generally defined by a conductance equation containing a state variable that imparts a memory effect. The current-voltage cycling causes transitions of the conductance, determined by different physical mechanisms such as the formation of conducting filaments in an insulating surrounding. Here we provide a unified description of the set and reset processes, by means of a single voltage activated relaxation time of the memory variable. This approach is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model that is widely used to describe action potentials dynamics in neurons. We focus on halide perovskite memristors and their intersection with neuroscience-inspired computing. We show that the modelling approach adeptly replicates the experimental traits of both volatile and nonvolatile memristors. Its versatility extends across various device materials and configurations, capturing nuanced behaviors such as scan rate- and upper vertex-dependence. The model also describes well the response to sequences of voltage pulses that cause synaptic potentiation effects. This model serves as a potent tool for comprehending and probing the underlying mechanisms of memristors, by indicating the relaxation properties that control observable response, which opens the way for a detailed physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Time of Multipore Nanofluidic Memristors for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristors have been positioned at the forefront of the purposes for carrying out neuromorphic computation. Their tuneable conductivity properties enable the imitation of synaptic behaviour. Multipore nanofluidic memristors have shown their memristic properties and are candidate devices for liquid neuromorphic systems. Such properties are visible through an inductive hysteresis in the current-voltage sweeps, which is then confirmed by the inductive characteristics in impedance spectroscopy measurements. The dynamic behaviour of memristors is largely determined by a voltage-dependent relaxation time. Here, we obtain the kinetic relaxation time of a multipore nanofluidic memristor via its impedance spectra. We show that the behaviour of this characteristic of memristors is comparable to that of natural neural systems. Hence, we open a way to study the mimic of neuron characteristics by searching for memristors with the same kinetic times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry recently introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024)]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron models using Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point-like models, excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites, introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group, excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in which each spin can take one of $\kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as colors. It was suggested in arXiv:2310.06745 that the order parameter for this model is always invariant with respect to permutations of the colors. We show here that this is false whenever $\kappa \ge 58$.</description>

      <title>Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the associated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.</description>

Abstract: We discuss adiabatic spectra and dynamics of the quantum, i.e. transverse field, Hopfield model with dilute memories (the number of stored patterns $p &lt; log_2 N$, where $N$ is the number of qubits). At some critical transverse field the model undergoes the quantum phase transition from the ordered to the paramagnetic state. The corresponding critical exponents are calculated and used to determine efficiency of quantum annealing protocols. We also discuss implications of these results for the quantum annealing of generic spin glass models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Loss Landscapes through the Lens of Spin Glass Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, significant strides in deep learning have led to numerous groundbreaking applications. Despite these advancements, the understanding of the high generalizability of deep learning, especially in such an over-parametrized space, remains limited. For instance, in deep neural networks (DNNs), their internal representations, decision-making mechanism, absence of overfitting in an over-parametrized space, superior generalizability, etc., remain less understood. Successful applications are often considered as empirical rather than scientific achievement. This paper delves into the loss landscape of DNNs through the lens of spin glass in statistical physics, a system characterized by a complex energy landscape with numerous metastable states, as a novel perspective in understanding how DNNs work. We investigated the loss landscape of single hidden layer neural networks activated by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function, and introduced several protocols to examine the analogy between DNNs and spin glass. Specifically, we used (1) random walk in the parameter space of DNNs to unravel the structures in their loss landscape; (2) a permutation-interpolation protocol to study the connection between copies of identical regions in the loss landscape due to the permutation symmetry in the hidden layers; (3) hierarchical clustering to reveal the hierarchy among trained solutions of DNNs, reminiscent of the so-called Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) phenomenon (i.e. the Parisi solution) in spin glass; (4) finally, we examine the relationship between the ruggedness of DNN's loss landscape and its generalizability, showing an improvement of flattened minima.</description>

      <title>Picosecond transfer from short-term to long-term memory in analog antiferromagnetic memory device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous experiments in compensated magnets have demonstrated a potential for approaching the limit of fastest and least-dissipative operation of digital memory bits. However, the analog route has been virtually unexplored at (sub)ps time scales. In this paper, we report on experimental separation of heat-related and quench-switching-related resistance signal dynamics induced at room temperature by a single femtosecond-laser-pulse in memory devices from metallic antiferromagnetic CuMnAs. We show that the heat-related dynamics, on picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds time scales, can be used as a short-term memory where information about input stimuli, represented by laser-pulses, is stored temporarily. When the quench-switching threshold is reached, information is transferred to the device variable resistance, serving as a long-term memory, with time components of 10 ms and 10 s. We also deduced 10 ps time scale as an upper estimate for a conversion of the short-lived transient temperature increase to the quench-switched metastable states.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walk of a genuine single-photon entangled state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>
