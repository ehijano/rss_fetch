      <title>Exploring the soft pinning effect in the dynamics and the structure dynamics correlation in multicomponent supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multicomponent liquids by increasing the mass of $15\%$ of the particles in a binary Kob-Andersen model. We find that the heavy particles have dual effects on the lighter particles. At higher temperatures, there is a significant decoupling of the dynamics between heavier and lighter particles, with the former resembling a pinned particle to the latter. The dynamics of the lighter particles slow down due to the excluded volume around the nearly immobile heavier particles. Conversely, at lower temperatures, there is a coupling between the dynamics of the heavier and lighter particles. The heavier particles' mass slows down the dynamics of both types of particles. This makes the soft pinning effect of the heavy particles questionable in this regime. We demonstrate that as the mass of the heavy particles increases, the coupling of the dynamics between the lighter and heavier particles weakens. Consequently, the heavier the mass of the heavy particles, the more effectively they act as soft pinning centres in both high and low-temperature regimes. A key finding is that akin to the pinned system, the self and collective dynamics of the lighter particles decouple from each other as the mass of the heavy particles has a more pronounced impact on the latter. We analyze the structure dynamics correlation by considering the system under the binary and modified quaternary framework, the latter describing the pinned system. Our findings indicate that whenever the heavy mass particles function as soft pinning centres, the modified quaternary framework predicts a higher correlation.</description>

      <title>How to define temperature in active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are used to measure temperature with a thermometer and we know from everyday life that different types of thermometers measure the same temperature. This experience can be based on equilibrium thermodynamics, which explains the equivalence of different possibilities to define temperature. In contrast, for systems out of equilibrium such as active matter, measurements performed with different thermometers can generally lead to different temperature values. In the present work, we systematically compare different possibilities to define temperature for active systems. Based on simulations and theory for inertial active Brownian particles, we find that different temperatures generally lead to different temperature values, as expected. Remarkably, however, we find that different temperatures not only lead to the same values near equilibrium (low P\'eclet number or high particle mass), but even far from equilibrium and in cases where entropy production is large, several different temperatures approximately coincide. In particular, we find that the kinetic temperature, the configurational temperature, and temperatures based on higher moments of the velocity distribution constitute a class of temperatures that all assume very similar values over a wide parameter range. The effective temperature also leads to similar temperature values but only in a limited parameter regime. Notably, temperatures exploiting the virial theorem, the Stokes-Einstein relation, or a harmonic confinement form a second class of temperatures whose values approximately coincide with each other but which strongly differ from those of the first class. Finally, we identify advantages and disadvantages of the different possibilities to define temperature and discuss their relevance for measuring the temperature of an active system.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for velocity profile of granular flow in rotating drums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically analyze the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are quantitatively consistent. Two distinct regions exist in the granular flow: the surface flow layer and the static flow regime associated with the rigid rotation near the bottom. The thickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows a slight dependence on the angular velocity of the rotating drum. Scaling laws for the velocity profile and the surface layer thickness are derived analytically based on the continuum model. The validity of the scaling laws is confirmed numerically.</description>

      <title>Criticality enhances the reinforcement of disordered networks by rigid inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of biological materials are spatially heterogeneous. Typical tissues are made up of a spanning fibrous extracellular matrix in which various inclusions, such as living cells, are embedded. While the influence of inclusions on the stiffness of common elastic materials such as rubber has been studied for decades and can be understood in terms of the volume fraction and shape of inclusions, the same is not true for disordered filamentous and fibrous networks. Recent work has shown that, in isolation, such networks exhibit unusual viscoelastic behavior indicative of an underlying mechanical phase transition controlled by network connectivity and strain. How this behavior is modified when inclusions are present is unclear. Here, we present a theoretical and computational study of the influence of rigid inclusions on the mechanics of disordered elastic networks near the connectivity-controlled central force rigidity transition. Combining scaling theory and coarse-grained simulations, we predict and confirm an anomalously strong dependence of the composite stiffness on inclusion volume fraction, beyond that seen in ordinary composites. This stiffening exceeds the well-established volume fraction-dependent stiffening expected in conventional composites, e.g., as an elastic analogue of the classic volume fraction dependent increase in the viscosity of liquids first identified by Einstein. We show that this enhancement is a consequence of the interplay between inter-particle spacing and an emergent correlation length, leading to an effective finite-size scaling imposed by the presence of inclusions. We outline the expected scaling of the shear modulus and strain fluctuations with the inclusion volume fraction and network connectivity, confirm these predictions in simulations, and discuss potential experimental tests and implications for our predictions in real systems.</description>

      <title>Cell Sorting in an Active Nematic Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mixture of extensile and contractile cells using a vertex model extended to include active nematic stresses. The two cell populations phase separate over time. While phase separation strengthens monotonically with an increasing magnitude of contractile activity, the dependence on extensile activity is non-monotonic, so that sufficiently high values reduce the extent of sorting. We interpret this by showing that extensile activity renders the system motile, enabling cells to undergo neighbour exchanges. Contractile cells that come into contact as a result are then more likely to stay connected due to an effective attraction arising from contractile activity.</description>

      <title>Activity Waves in Condensed Phases of Quincke Rollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-exciting is a universal phenomenon in physical and biological excitable systems. Here we show that colloidal systems of Quincke rollers which are driven periodically can condense into active liquids and active crystals, in which waves can be excited. In active liquids, the waves propagate antiparallel to local density gradients via the splitting of dense bands, and cross over each other in collision as sound waves do. The waves in active crystals have a sharp front like that of shock waves, and propagate parallel to local density gradients. The shock waves annihilate or converge as they collide. Detailed investigations on microscopic dynamics reveal that in sound waves, the dynamics of rollers is dominated by electrostatic repulsions; in shock waves, the dynamics is encoded with a density-dependent collective memory. These findings demonstrate a realization of excitable colloidal systems with tunable dynamics. This is of great interests in exploring the principles of self-organization and the fabrication of active functional materials.</description>

      <title>Inspection paradox and jump detection in glassy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics in glassy systems near the phase transition is characterized by the occurrence of particle jumps. Approaches to describe these jumps are based on models which include the time and length scales defining the jump dynamics as parameters to be determined. We instead propose a model-independent method to detect these jumps. Our method adopts the formalism of the inspection paradox to examine particle trajectories and reveal the time and length scales defining a jump without including these scales as free parameters. This method allows for reinterpreting the results of previous model-dependent approaches, in particular the decoupling between self-diffusion and structural relaxation observed in glassy systems. Given its simplicity and generality, our method can be applied to resolve hopping motion in a broad class of systems, including experimental ones.</description>

      <title>Viscous liquid dynamics modeled as random walks within overlapping hyperspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypersphere model is a simple one-parameter model of the potential energy landscape of viscous liquids, which consists of a percolating system of hyperspheres of equal sizes randomly distributed in $R^{3N}$ where $N$ is the number of particles. We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in 12 to 45 dimensions, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the hyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find behavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density (corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the dynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement as a function of time is found to be very similar to that of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well the frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different chemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 248001 (2017)].</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of pulsating active liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by dense contractile tissues, where cells are subject to periodic deformation, we formulate and study a generic hydrodynamic theory of pulsating active liquids. Combining mechanical and phenomenological arguments, we postulate that the mechanochemical feedback between the local phase, which describes how cells deform due to autonomous driving, and the local density can be described in terms of a free energy. We argue that such a feedback is consistent with the coarse-graining of a broad class of microscopic models. Our hydrodynamics captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based counterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with constant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. Remarkably, we show that the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in terms of an effective landscape, and argue that waves can be regarded as secondary instabilities. Linear stability analysis of the arrested and cycling states, including the role of fluctuations, leads to predictions for the phase boundaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that our minimal, yet non-trivial model provides a relevant platform to study the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the frontiers of nanotechnology is advancing beyond the periodic self-assembly of materials. Icosahedral quasicrystals, aperiodic in all directions, represent one of the most challenging targets that have yet to be experimentally realized at the colloidal scale. Previous attempts have required meticulous human-designed building blocks and often resulted in interactions beyond current experimental capabilities. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating experimentally accessible designs that self-assemble into quasicrystalline arrangements. We present a design for icosahedral DNA-origami building blocks and demonstrate, through molecular simulations, their successful assembly into the target quasicrystalline structure. Our results highlight the feasibility of using automated design protocols to achieve complex quasicrystalline patterns, paving the way for new applications in material science and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Stochastic migrations of Marangoni surfers between two lobes of a dumbbell-shaped confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental investigation on the stochastic migration dynamics of Marangoni surfers (camphor-infused paper disks) between the two lobes of a dumbbell-shaped chamber. We characterize the migration dynamics using survival analysis for a given configuration with a unique disk count in each lobe. Qualitatively, all the configurations exhibit stretched exponential decay with time, ascribed to a disk s aging. A given configuration s stability decreases with increasing pairwise interactions. The most stable configuration is always the one with equal partitioning of disks between the lobes, i.e., exactly one-half of disks in each lobe for even-numbered systems but with one extra disk in either of the lobes for odd-numbered systems. Furthermore, we model a camphor disk as a Chiral Active Particle (CAP), as initially proposed by Cruz et al. and show that decreasing motility (or aging) indeed causes the stretched exponential behavior.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates emerging from protein chain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers. The cellular functions of the resulting membraneless organelles are closely linked to their physical properties over a wide range of length- and timescales: From the nanosecond dynamics of individual molecules and their interactions, to the microsecond translational diffusion of molecules in the condensates, to their viscoelastic properties at the mesoscopic scale. However, it has remained unclear how to quantitatively link these properties across scales. Here we address this question by combining single-molecule fluorescence, correlation spectroscopy, microrheology, and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on different condensates that are formed by complex coacervation and span about two orders of magnitude in viscosity and their dynamics at the molecular scale. Remarkably, we find that the absolute timescale of protein chain dynamics in the dense phases can be quantitatively and accurately related to translational diffusion and condensate viscosities by Rouse theory of polymer solutions including entanglement. The simulations indicate that the observed wide range of dynamics arises from different contact lifetimes between amino acid residues, which in the mean-field description of the polymer model cause differences in the friction acting on the chains. These results suggest that remarkably simple physical principles can relate the mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates to their dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Progression of Cancerous Tumors in Mice: A Machine and Deep Learning Intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered modeling to predict the evolution of cancer tumor cells in mice under different forms of treatment. The AI models are analyzed against varying ambient and systemic parameters, e.g. drug dosage, volume of the cancer cell mass, and time taken to destroy the cancer cell mass. The data required for the analysis have been synthetically extracted from plots available in both published and unpublished literature (primarily using a Matlab architecture called "Grabit"), that are then statistically standardized around the same baseline for comparison. Three forms of treatment are considered - saline (multiple concentrations used), magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) and fluorodeoxyglycose iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mNP-FDGs) - analyzed using three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilinear Regression (MLR), and a Deep Learning (DL) module, the Adaptive Neural Network (ANN). The AI models are trained on 60-80% data, the rest used for validation. Assessed over all three forms of treatment, ANN consistently outperforms other predictive models. Our models predict mNP-FDG as the most potent treatment regime that kills the cancerous tumor completely in ca 13 days from the start of treatment. The models can be generalized to other forms of cancer treatment regimens.</description>

      <title>On The Effect Of Size On The Kinetics Of Reactions In Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactions in solution require "contact" between the reagents. We can predict the rate at which reagents come into "contact" (at least in dilute conditions), but if the initial collision does not lead to reaction, what happens then? The collision rates in solution-phase reactions are generally described (explicitly or implicitly) with the Smoluchowski equation. Unfortunately, that model describes coagulations in gases, not reactions in solutions. The model is memory-less, i.e., collisions are treated as random processes, unaware of each other in space and time. The reality is that unreactive collisions create memory: particles (even molecules) "remember" they just collided, i.e, the probability of collision depends on how far back in time their prior collision happened. As we show here, this purely geometric and statistical fact is valid as long as their size is larger than the Kuhn length of their Brownian motion in solution. Under these conditions, particles in solution form, even in the absence of attractive interactions, relatively long-lived "clusters" kept together by the statistical unlikeliness of separating. We show here through Brownian dynamics simulations that, as a result of this memory, the collision rates and the lifetimes of these clusters, differently from what predicted by Smoluchowski's model, are proportional to the ratio between the radius of the colliders and the Kuhn length of their path in solution, with a coefficient close to unity!</description>

      <title>Counterfactual rewards promote collective transport using individually controlled swarm microrobots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</description>

Abstract: We propose a reaction-diffusion system that converts topological information of an active nematic into chemical signals. We show that a curvature-activated reaction dipole is sufficient for creating a system that dynamically senses topology by producing a concentration field possessing local extrema coinciding with $\pm\frac{1}{2}$ defects. The enabling term is analogous to polarization charge density seen in dielectric materials. We demonstrate the ability of this system to identify defects in both passive and active nematics. The model demonstrates that a relatively simple feedback scheme in the form of a PDE system is capable of producing chemical signals in response to inherently non-local structures in anisotropic media. We posit that such coarse-grained systems can help generate testable hypotheses for regulated processes in biological systems such as morphogenesis and motivate the creation of bioinspired materials that utilize dynamic coupling between nematic structure and biochemistry.</description>

      <title>On the incremental equations in surface elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the incremental equations for a hyperelastic solid that incorporate surface tension effect by assuming that the surface energy is a general function of the surface deformation gradient. The incremental equations take the same simple form as their purely mechanical counterparts and are valid for any geometry. In particular, for isotropic materials, the extra surface elastic moduli are expressed in terms of the surface energy function and the two surface principal stretches. The effectiveness of the resulting incremental theory is illustrated by applying it to study the Plateau--Rayleigh and Wilkes instabilities in a solid cylinder.</description>

      <title>How do particles with complex interactions self-assemble?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In living cells, proteins self-assemble into large functional structures based on specific interactions between molecularly complex patches. Due to this complexity, protein self-assembly results from a competition between a large number of distinct interaction energies, of the order of one per pair of patches. Current self-assembly models however typically ignore this aspect, and the principles by which it determines the large-scale structure of protein assemblies are largely unknown. Here, we use Monte-Carlo simulations and machine learning to start to unravel these principles. We observe that despite widespread geometrical frustration, aggregates of particles with complex interactions fall within only a few categories that often display high degrees of spatial order, including crystals, fibers, and oligomers. We then successfully identify the most relevant aspect of the interaction complexity in predicting these outcomes, namely the particles' ability to form periodic structures. Our results provide a first extensive characterization of the rich design space associated with identical particles with complex interactions, and could inspire engineered self-assembling nanoobjects as well as help understand the emergence of robust functional protein structures.</description>

      <title>Emergence and Growth Dynamics of Wetting-induced Phase Separation on Soft Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid droplets on soft solids, such as soft polymeric gels, can induce substantial surface deformations, leading to the formation of wetting ridges at contact points. While these contact ridges have been shown to govern the rich surface mechanics on compliant substrates, the inherently divergent characteristics of contact points and the multiphase nature of soft reticulated gels pose great challenges for continuum mechanical theories in modeling soft wetting phenomena. In this study, we report in-situ experimental characterizations of the emergence and growth dynamics of the wetting-induced phase separation. The measurements demonstrate how the migration of free chains prevents the stress singularities at contact points. Based on the Onsager variational principle, we present a phenomenological model that effectively captures the extraction process of free chains, including a crossover from a short-term diffusive state to a long-term equilibrium state. By comparing model predictions with experimental results for varied crosslinking densities, we reveal how the intrinsic material parameters of soft gels dictate phase separation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental measurements of the granular density of modes via impact</title>

Abstract: The jamming transition is an important feature of granular materials, with prior work showing an excess of low frequency modes in the granular analog to the density of states, the granular density of modes. In this work, we present an experimental method for acoustically measuring the granular density of modes using a single impact event to excite vibrational modes in an experimental, three dimensional, granular material. We test three different granular materials, all of which are composed of spherical beads. The first two systems are monodisperse collections of either 6 mm or 8 mm diameter beads. The third system is a bidisperse mixture of the previous two bead sizes. During data collection, the particles are confined to a box; on top of this box, and resting on the granular material, is a light, rigid sheet onto which pressure can be applied to the system. To excite the material, a steel impactor ball is dropped on top of the system. The response of the granular material to the impact pulse is recorded by piezoelectric sensors buried throughout the material, and the density of modes is computed from the spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation of these sensors. Our measurements of the density of modes show more low frequency modes at low pressure, consistent with previous experimental and numerical results, as well as several low frequency peaks in the density of modes that shift with applied pressure. Our method represents an experimentally simple technique for investigating the granular density of modes and may increase the accessibility and number of such measurements.</description>

      <title>Interaction between U-shaped amyloid beta fibril and semiconducting silicon nitride monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by some recent works showing the ability of semiconducting monolayers to disintegrate the structures of biological fibrils, we have applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in both classical and quantum regimes to investigate whether semiconducting Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has the same ability on interaction with U-shaped amyloid beta (A$\beta$) fibril. In agreement with the literature, we found that disintegration began from the last chain (E) due to the rather strong interaction between the monolayer and the fibril residues numbered from 17 to 28 on the very chain, also engaging the next chain (D) over time. As a result, the $\beta$-sheet-rich content of chain E considerably decreases on interaction with the monolayer, turning into other secondary-structure types including turn and coil, in accordance with experimental findings. Results endorse the view that semiconducting Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has the potential of destabilizing the structure and conformation of U-shaped amyloid beta fibrils.</description>

      <title>Stability of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robot Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of variational principles for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is subjected to a fixed value and the other end is free, have been less studied in terms of their stability despite their abundance. In this article, we develop the stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional using the generalized Jacobi condition. This involves computing conjugate points that are determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to a tip load. Kirchhoff rod theory is employed to model the elastic rod deformations. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. This snap-back instability is demonstrated using various examples, highlighting its dependence on various system parameters. The presented examples illustrate the potential applications in the design of flexible soft robot arms and innovative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Thermodynamics without Einstein Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials that are constantly driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium, such as active and living systems, typically violate the Einstein relation. This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to departure from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperature-like variable which restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily nonnegative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>
