      <title>Polyhedral Aspects of Maxoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditional independence (CI) relation of a distribution in a max-linear Bayesian network depends on its weight matrix through the $C^\ast$-separation criterion. These CI models, which we call maxoids, are compositional graphoids which are in general not representable by Gaussian or discrete random variables. We prove that every maxoid can be obtained from a transitively closed weighted DAG and show that the stratification of generic weight matrices by their maxoids yields a polyhedral fan.</description>

      <title>Bull-free graphs and $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bull is a graph obtained from a four-vertex path by adding a vertex adjacent to the two middle vertices of the path. A graph $G$ is bull-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is a bull. We prove that for all $k,t\in \mathbb{N}$, if $G$ is a bull-free graph of clique number at most $k$ and every triangle-free induced subgraph of $G$ has chromatic number at most $t$, then $G$ has chromatic number at most $k^{\mathcal{O}(\log t)}$. We further show that the bound $k^{\mathcal{O}(\log t)}$ is best possible up to a multiplicative constant in the exponent.
  The previously best known bound was of the form $2^{poly(k,t)\log poly(k,t)}$, due to Thomass\'{e}, Trotignon and Vu\v{s}kovi\'{c} (2017), whose proof uses Chudnovsky's decomposition theorem for bull-free graphs. Our result also implies that every $\chi$-bounded hereditary class of bull-free graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. This was recently given a 10-page proof by Chudnovsky, Cook, Davies and Oum (2023) that relies heavily on Chudnovsky's structure theorem.
  Our proof is a single page long and completely avoids the structure theorem, using only one result of Chudnovsky and Safra (which itself has a short proof).</description>

      <title>Induced Minors and Region Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any positive integers $g$ and $t$, there is a $K_{6}^{(1)}$-induced-minor-free graph of girth at least $g$ that is not a region intersection graph over the class of $K_t$-minor-free graphs. This answers in a strong form the recently raised question of whether for every graph $H$ there is a graph $H'$ such that $H$-induced-minor-free graphs are region intersection graphs over $H'$-minor-free graphs.</description>

      <title>On polynomially high-chromatic pure pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a forest. We study polynomially high-chromatic pure pairs in graphs with no $T$ as an induced subgraph ($T$-free graphs in other words), with applications to the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture. In addition to reproving several known results in the literature, we deduce:
  $\bullet$ If $T=P_5$ is the five-vertex path, then every $T$-free graph $G$ with clique number $w\ge2$ contains a complete pair $(A,B)$ of induced subgraphs with $\chi(A)\ge w^{-d}\chi(G)$ and $\chi(B)\ge 2^{-d}\chi(G)$, for some universal $d\ge1$. Via the classical Gy\'arf\'as path argument, this ``polynomial versus linear complete pairs'' result can be viewed as further supporting evidence for the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture for $P_5$. In particular, it implies
  \[\chi(G)\le w^{O(\log w/\log\log w)}\]
  which asymptotically improves the bound $\chi(G)\le w^{\log w}$ of Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl.
  $\bullet$ If $T$ and a broom satisfy the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture, then so does their disjoint union. Unifying earlier results of Chudnovsky, Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl, and of Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl, this gives new instances of $T$ for which the conjecture holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the study of $S_n$-ensembles: $n \times n$ arrays of permutations of $[n]$ that encode the boundary data of $n\Delta_{n-1}$. We characterize precisely when an $S_4$-ensemble contains a permutation appearing exactly four times, leading to a complete description of the types of boundary of $4\Delta_3$ that can be extended to fine mixed subdivisions.</description>

      <title>On an alternating sum of factorials and Stirling numbers of the first kind: trees, lattices, and games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an alternating sum involving factorials and Stirling numbers of the first kind. We give an exponential generating function for these numbers and show they are nonnegative and enumerate the number of increasing trees on $n$ vertices that are won by the second of two players when interpreted as a game tree. We also give a simple description of the quotient from the weak order to the Tamari lattice in terms of plane trees, and give bijections between plane trees, 213-avoiding permutations, and 312-avoiding permutations. Finally, for a rooted tree, we give equivalent characterizations of when it describes a game won by the first or second player in terms of the rank-generating function of the lattice of prunings and the Euler characteristic of an associated real variety.</description>

      <title>On possible uniform Tur\'an densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian of a palette $P$ is the largest $d$ such that $P$ defines a $3$-graph with local density at least $d$. Let $\Lambda_{\text{pal}}^{(3)}$ denote the set of palette Lagrangians and let $\Pi^{(3)}_{\therefore,\text{fin}}$ be the set of uniform Tur\'an densities of finite families of $3$-graphs. We show that $\Lambda_{\text{pal}}^{(3)} \subseteq \Pi^{(3)}_{\therefore,\text{fin}}$. Together with a recent result by Lamaison, this yields $\Lambda_{\text{pal}}^{(3)} \subseteq\Pi^{(3)}_{\therefore,\text{fin}} \subseteq \overline{\Lambda_{\text{pal}}^{(3)}}$. This matches the situation for the Tur\'an densities of finite families.</description>

      <title>The Metric Dimension of Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013, Bollob\'as, Mitsche, and Pralat at gave upper and lower bounds for the likely metric dimension of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $G(n,p)$ for a large range of expected degrees $d=pn$. However, their results only apply when $d \ge \log^5 n$, leaving open sparser random graphs with $d &lt; \log^5 n$. Here we provide upper and lower bounds on the likely metric dimension of $G(n,p)$ from just above the connectivity transition, i.e., where $d=pn=c \log n$ for some $c &gt; 1$, up to $d=\log^5 n$. Our lower bound technique is based on an entropic argument which is more general than the use of Suen's inequality by Bollob\'as, Mitsche, and Pralat, whereas our upper bound is similar to theirs.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Identities Using the Matrix Tree Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix tree theorem, initially formulated by Kirchhoff, is a fundamental result in algebraic graph theory that provides an elegant way to count spanning trees using the Laplacian determinant. In this paper, we explore some interesting applications of the matrix tree theorem. In particular, we present a combinatorial interpretation of a distribution of $(n-1)^{n-1}$, in the context of uprooted spanning trees of the complete graph $K_{n}$, which was previously obtained by Chauve--Dulucq--Guibert. Furthermore, we establish a combinatorial explanation for the distribution of $m^{n-1}n^{m-1}$, related to spanning trees of the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, which seems new.</description>

      <title>Indecomposability of the median hypersimplex and polytopality of the hemi-icosahedral Bier sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the median hypersimplex $\Delta_{2k,k}$ is Minkowski indecomposable, i.e. it cannot be expressed as a non-trivial Minkowski sum $\Delta_{2k,k} = P+Q$, where $P\neq \lambda\Delta_{2k,k}\neq Q$. We obtain as a corollary that $\Delta_{2k,k}$ represents a ray in the submodular cone (the deformation cone of the permutahedron). Building on the previously developed geometric methods and extensive computer search, we exhibit a twelve vertex, $4$-dimensional polytopal realization of the Bier sphere of the hemi-icosahedron, the vertex minimal triangulation of the real projective plane.</description>

      <title>On the magic positivity of Ehrhart polynomials of dilated polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $d$ is said to be magic positive if all the coefficients are non-negative when $f(x)$ is expanded with respect to the basis $\{x^i(x+1)^{d-i}\}_{i=0}^d$. It is known that if $f(x)$ is magic positive, then the polynomial appearing in the numerator of its generating function is real-rooted. In this paper, we show that for a polynomial $f(x)$ with positive real coefficients, there exists a positive real number $k$ such that $f(k'x)$ is magic positive for any $k' \geq k$. Furthermore, for any integer $d\geq3$, we show the existence of a $d$-dimensional polytope $P$ such that the Ehrhart polynomial of $kP$ is not magic positive for a given integer $k$. Finally, we investigate how much certain polytopes need to be dilated to make their Ehrhart polynomials magic positive.</description>

      <title>Powers of 2 in Balanced Grid Colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B(m, n)$ be the number of ways to colour a $2m \times 2n$ grid in black and white so that, in each row and each column, half of the cells are white and half are black. Bhattacharya conjectured that the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorisation of $B(m, n)$ equals $s_2(m)s_2(n)$, where $s_2(x)$ denotes the number of $1$s in the binary expansion of $x$. We confirm this conjecture in some infinite families of special cases; most significantly, when $m$ is of the form either $2^k$ or $2^k + 1$ and $n$ is arbitrary. The proof when $m = 2^k + 1$ is substantially more difficult, and in connection with it we develop some general techniques for the analysis of inequalities between binary digit sums.</description>

      <title>1-2 Conjectures for Graphs with Low Degeneracy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Keusch proved the so-called 1-2-3 Conjecture, raised by Karo\'nski, {\L}uczak, and Thomason in 2004: for every connected graph different from $K_2$, we can assign labels~$1,2,3$ to the edges so that no two adjacent vertices are incident to the same sum of labels. Despite this significant result, several problems close to the 1-2-3 Conjecture in spirit remain widely open. In this work, we focus on the so-called 1-2 Conjecture, raised by Przyby{\l}o and Wo\'zniak in 2010, which is a counterpart of the 1-2-3 Conjecture where labels~$1,2$ only can be assigned, and both vertices and edges are labelled. We consider both the 1-2 Conjecture in its original form, where adjacent vertices must be distinguished w.r.t.~their sums of incident labels, and variants for products and multisets. We prove some of these conjectures for graphs with bounded maximum degree (at most~$6$) and bounded maximum average degree (at most~$3$), going beyond earlier results of the same sort.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of distance-biregular graphs related to hyperovals and a new sporadic example of a distance-biregular graph related to Mathon's perp system. The infinite family can be explained using 2-Y- homogeneity, while the sporadic example belongs to a generalization of a construction by Delorme. Additionally, we give a new non-existence criteria for distance-biregular graphs.</description>

      <title>Co-maximal Hypergraph on Dn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $S$ be the set of all non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$. \textit{The co-maximal hypergraph of $G$}, denoted by $Co_\mathcal{H}(G)$, is a hypergraph whose vertex set is $\{H \in S \,\, | \,\, H K = G \,\, \text{for some} \, K \in S \}$ and hyperedges are the maximal subsets of the vertex set with the property that the product of any two vertices is equal to $G$. The aim of this paper is to study the co-maximal hypergraph of dihedral groups, $Co_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. We examine some of the structural properties, viz., diameter, girth and chromatic number of $Co_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. Also, we provide characterizations for hypertrees, star structures and 3-uniform hypergraphs of $Co_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. Further, we discuss the possibilities of $Co_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$ which can be embedded on the plane, torus and projective plane.</description>

      <title>The minimum crossing number and minimum size of maximal 1-plane graphs with given connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1-planar graph is a graph which has a drawing on the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. If a 1-planar graph is drawn in that way, the drawing is called a {\it 1-plane graph}. A graph is maximal 1-plane (or 1-planar) if no additional edge can be added without violating 1-planarity or simplicity. It is known that any maximal 1-plane graph is $k$-connected for some $k$ with $2\le k\le 7$. Recently, Huang et al. proved that any maximal 1-plane graph with $n$ ($\ge 5$) vertices has at least $\lceil\frac{7}{3}n\rceil-3$ edges, which is tight for all integers $n\ge 5$. In this paper, we study $k$-connected maximal 1-plane graphs for each $k$ with $3\le k\le 7$, and establish a lower bound for their crossing numbers and a lower bound for their edge numbers, respectively.</description>

      <title>Cycles of lengths 3 and n-1 in digraphs under a Bang-Jensen-Gutin-Li type conditon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bang-Jensen-Gutin-Li type conditions are the conditions for hamiltonicity of digraphs which impose degree restrictions on nonadjacent vertices which have a common in-neighbor or a common out-neighbor. They can be viewed as an extension of Fan type conditions in undirected graphs, as well as generalization of locally (in-, out-)semicomplete digraphs. Since their first appearance in 1996, various Bang-Jensen-Gutin-Li type conditions for hamitonicity have come forth. In this paper we establish a condition of Bang-Jensen-Gutin-Li type which implies not only a hamiltonian cycle but also a 3-cycle and an (n-1)-cycle, with well-characterized exceptional graphs. We conjecture that this condition implies the existence of cycle of every length.</description>

      <title>Path Extendable Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph $D$ is called \emph{path extendable} if for every nonhamiltonian (directed) path $P$ in $D$, there exists another path $P^\prime$ with the same initial and terminal vertices as $P$, and $V(P^\prime) = V (P)\cup \{w\}$ for a vertex $w \in V(D)\setminus V(P)$. Hence, path extendability implies paths of continuous lengths between every vertex pair. In earlier works of C. Thomassen and K. Zhang, it was shown that the condition of small $i(T)$ or positive $\pi_2(T)$ implies paths of continuous lengths between every vertex pair in a tournament $T$, where $i(T)$ is the irregularity of $T$ and $\pi_2(T)$ denotes for the minimum number of paths of length $2$ from $u$ to $v$ among all vertex pairs $\{u,v\}$. Motivated by these results, we study sufficient conditions in terms of $i(T)$ and $\pi_2(T)$ that guarantee a tournament $T$ is path extendable. We prove that (1) a tournament $T$ is path extendable if $i(T)&lt; 2\pi_2(T)-(|T|+8)/6$, and (2) a tournament $T$ is path extendable if $\pi_2(T) &gt; (7|T|-10)/36$. As an application, we deduce that almost all random tournaments are path extendable.</description>

      <title>The inequality on the number of $1$-hooks, $2$-hooks and $3$-hooks in $t$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $b_{n,k}$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. Singh and Barman raised the question of finding the relation between $b_{t,2}(n)$ and $b_{t,1}(n)$. Kim showed that there exists $N$ such that $b_{t,2}(n)\ge b_{t,1}(n)$ and $b_{t,2}(n) \geq b_{t,3}(n)$ for $n&gt;N$. In this paper, we find an explicit bound of $N=O(t^5)$ for $b_{t,2}(n)\geq b_{t,1}(n)$ and show that $b_{t,2}(n) \geq b_{t,3}(n)$ for all $n\ge 4$.</description>

      <title>Local Weak Degeneracy of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomassen showed that planar graphs are 5-list-colourable, and that planar graphs of girth at least five are 3-list-colourable. An easy degeneracy argument shows that planar graphs of girth at least four are 4-list-colourable. In 2022, Postle and Smith-Roberge proved a common strengthening of these three results: with $g(v)$ denoting the length of a shortest cycle containing a vertex $v$, they showed that if $G$ is a planar graph and $L$ a list assignment for $G$ where $|L(v)| \geq \max\{3,8-g(v)\}$ for all $v \in V(G)$, then $G$ is $L$-colourable. Moreover, they conjectured that an analogous theorem should hold for correspondence colouring. We prove this conjecture; in fact, our main theorem holds in the still more restrictive setting of weak degeneracy, and moreover acts as a joint strengthening of the fact that planar graphs are weakly 4-degenerate (originally due to Bernshteyn, Lee, and Smith-Roberge), and that planar graphs of girth at least five are weakly 2-degenerate (originally due to Han et al.).</description>

Abstract: It is shown that if each element of a group $G$ of permutations on $\mathbb{Z}$ displaces points by a bounded distance, then infinitely divisible elements of $G$ are torsion. One can replace the metric space $\mathbb{Z}$ with one which is sufficiently tree-like and having uniform bounds on the cardinalities of balls of a given radius. As a consequence we give a positive solution to a problem of N. M. Suchkov in the Kourovka Notebook.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decomposition of Forman-Ricci Curvature on Vietoris-Rips Complexes and Data Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) is an efficient tool that characterizes essential geometrical features and associated transitions of real-world networks, extending seamlessly to higher-dimensional computations in simplicial complexes. In this article, we provide two major advancements: First, we give a decomposition for FRC, enabling local computations of FRC. Second, we construct a set-theoretical proof enabling an efficient algorithm for the local computation of FRC in Vietoris-Rips (VR) complexes.Strikingly, this approach reveals critical information and geometric insights often overlooked by conventional classification techniques. Our findings open new avenues for geometric computations in VR complexes and highlight an essential yet under-explored aspect of data classification: the geometry underpinning statistical patterns.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic diameter of preferential attachment model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic diameter of the preferential attachment model $\operatorname{PA}\!_n^{(m,\delta)}$ with parameters $m \ge 2$ and $\delta &gt; 0$. Building on the recent work \cite{VZ25}, we prove that the diameter of $G_n \sim \operatorname{PA}\!_n^{(m,\delta)}$ is $(1+o(1))\log_\nu n$ with high probability, where $\nu$ is the exponential growth rate of the local weak limit of $G_n$. Our result confirms the conjecture in \cite{VZ25} and closes the remaining gap in understanding the asymptotic diameter of preferential attachment graphs with general parameters $m \ge 1$ and $\delta &gt;-m$. Our proof follows a general recipe that relates the diameter of a random graph to its typical distance, which we expect to have applicability in a broader range of models.</description>

      <title>Bounded powers of edge ideals: Gorenstein toric rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I \subset S$ a monomial ideal. Given a vector $\mathfrak{c}\in\mathbb{N}^n$, the ideal $I_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is the ideal generated by those monomials belonging to $I$ whose exponent vectors are componentwise bounded above by $\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)$ be the largest integer $q$ for which $(I^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}\neq 0$. For a finite graph $G$, its edge ideal is denoted by $I(G)$. Let $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ be the toric ring which is generated by the monomials belonging to the minimal system of monomial generators of $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$. In a previous work, the authors proved that $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is a polymatroidal ideal. It follows that $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ is a normal Cohen--Macaulay domain. In this paper, we study the Gorenstein property of $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimum weight codewords of affine Cartesian codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine Cartesian codes were first discussed by Geil and Thomsen in 2013 in a broader framework and were formally introduced by L\'opez, Renter\'ia-M\'arquez and Villarreal in 2014. These are linear error-correcting codes obtained by evaluating polynomials at points of a Cartesian product of subsets of the given finite field. They can be viewed as a vast generalization of Reed-Muller codes. In 1970, Delsarte, Goethals and MacWilliams gave a %characterization of minimum weight codewords of Reed-Muller codes and also formula for the minimum weight codewords of Reed-Muller codes. Carvalho and Neumann in 2020 considered affine Cartesian codes in a special setting where the subsets in the Cartesian product are nested subfields of the given finite field, and gave a characterization of their minimum weight codewords. We use this to give an explicit formula for the number of minimum weight codewords of affine Cartesian codes in the case of nested subfields. This is seen to unify the known formulas for the number of minimum weight codewords of Reed-Solomon codes and Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Construction, Extension and Paths of Near-Homogeneous Tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A homogeneous tournament is a tournament with $4t+3$ vertices such that every arc is contained in exactly $t+1$ cycles of length $3$. Homogeneous tournaments are the first class of tournaments that are proved to be path extendable, which means that every nonhamiltonian path $P$ in such a tournament $T$ can be extended to a path $P'$ with the same initial and terminal vertex and $V(P')=V(P)\cup \{u\}$ for a certain vertex $u\in V(T)\backslash V(P)$. In order to find more path extendable tournaments we study the generalization of homogeneous tournaments called near-homogeneous tournaments, in which every arc is contained in $t$ or $t+1$ cycles of length $3$. Near-homogeneity has been defined in tournaments with $4t+1$ vertices. In this paper, we raise a new method to construct near-homogeneous tournaments with $4t+1$ vertices. We then show that the definition of near-homogeneous tournament can be extended to tournaments with an even number of vertices. Finally we verify path extendability of near-homogeneous tournaments, thus expand the class of path extendable tournaments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a chain of cycles of genus $g$. Let $d$,$r$ be integers with $1 \leq r \leq g-2$ and $2r\leq d \leq g-3+r$. Then $w^r_d(\Gamma)=d-2r$ implies $\Gamma$ is hyperelliptic. For each $g \geq 2r+3$ there exist non-hyperelliptic chains of cycles satisfying $w^r_{g-2+r}(\Gamma)=g-2-r$. In the case of algebraic curves such equality implies the curve is hyperelliptic. In particular we obtain the existence of chains of cycles $\Gamma$ such that $w^r_{g-2+r}(\Gamma) \neq w^1_{g-r}(\Gamma)$ in case $r \geq 2$. In the case of algebraic curves such numbers are equal because of the Riemann-Roch Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric edge polytopes of graphs are important object in Ehrhart theory,and have an application to Kuramoto models. In the present paper, we study the upper and lower bounds for the number of facets of symmetric edge polytopes of connected graphs conjectured by Braun and Bruegge. In particular, we show that their conjecture is true for any graph that is the join of two graphs (equivalently, for any connected graph whose complement graph is not connected). It is known that any symmetric edge polytope is a centrally symmetric reflexive polytope. Hence our results give a partial answer to Nill's conjecture: the number of facets of a $d$-dimensional reflexive polytope is at most $6^{d/2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce peaceful colourings, a variant of $h$-conflict free colourings. We call a colouring with no monochromatic edges $p$-peaceful if for each vertex $v$, there are at most $p$ neighbours of $v$ coloured with a colour appearing on another neighbour of $v$. An $h$-conflict-free colouring of a graph is a (vertex)-colouring with no monochromatic edges so that for every vertex $v$, the number of neighbours of $v$ which are coloured with a colour appearing on no other neighbour of $v$ is at least the minimum of $h$ and the degree of $v$. If $G$ is $\Delta$-regular then it has an $h$-conflict free colouring precisely if it has a $(\Delta-h)$-peaceful colouring. We focus on the minimum $p_\Delta$ of those $p$ for which every graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has a $p$-peaceful colouring with $\Delta+1$ colours. We show that $p_\Delta &gt; (1-\frac{1}{e}-o(1))\Delta$ and that for graphs of bounded codegree, $p_\Delta \leq (1-\frac{1}{e}+o(1))\Delta$. We ask if the latter result can be improved by dropping the bound on the codegree. As a partial result, we show that $p_\Delta \leq \frac{8000}{8001}\Delta$ for sufficiently large $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>A point-variety incidence theorem over finite fields, and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incidence problems between geometric objects is a key area of focus in the field of discrete geometry. Among them, the study of incidence problems over finite fields have received a considerable amount of attention in recent years.
  In this paper, by characterizing the singular values and singular vectors of the corresponding incidence matrix through group algebras, we prove a bound on the number of incidences between points and varieties of a certain form over finite fields. Our result leads to a new incidence bound for points and flats in finite geometries, which improves previous results for certain parameter regimes. As another application of our point-variety incidence bound, we extend a result on pinned distance problems by Phuong, Thang, and Vinh, and independently by Cilleruelo, Iosevich, Lund, Roche-Newton, and Rudnev, under a weaker condition.</description>

      <title>Subsquares in random Latin rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $k$ is a function of $n$ and $n\to\infty$. We show that with probability $1-O(1/n)$, a uniformly random $k\times n$ Latin rectangle contains no proper Latin subsquare of order $4$ or more, proving a conjecture of Divoux, Kelly, Kennedy and Sidhu. We also show that the expected number of subsquares of order 3 is bounded and find that the expected number of subsquares of order 2 is $\binom{k}{2}(1/2+o(1))$ for all $k\le n$.</description>

      <title>Hertzsprung patterns on involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hertzsprung patterns, recently introduced by Anders Claesson, are subsequences of a permutation contiguous in both positions and values, and can be seen as a subclass of bivincular patterns.
  This paper investigates Hertzsprung patterns within involutions, where additional structural constraints introduce new challenges. We present a general formula for enumerating occurrences of these patterns in involutions.
  We also analyze specific cases to derive the distribution of all Hertzsprung patterns of lengths two and three.</description>

      <title>On Supports for graphs of bounded genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{E})$ be a hypergraph. A support is a graph $Q$ on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the subgraph of $Q$ induced on the elements in $E$ is connected. We consider the problem of constructing a support for hypergraphs defined by connected subgraphs of a host graph. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of connected subgraphs of $G$. Let the vertices of $G$ be partitioned into two sets the \emph{terminals} $\mathbf{b}(V)$ and the \emph{non-terminals} $\mathbf{r}(V)$. We define a hypergraph on $\mathbf{b}(V)$, where each $H\in\mathcal{H}$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the vertices of $\mathbf{b}(V)$ in $H$.
  We also consider the problem of constructing a support for the \emph{dual hypergraph} - a hypergraph on $\mathcal{H}$ where each $v\in \mathbf{b}(V)$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $v$. In fact, we construct supports for a common generalization of the primal and dual settings called the \emph{intersection hypergraph}.
  As our main result, we show that if the host graph $G$ has bounded genus and the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ satisfy a condition of being \emph{cross-free}, then there exists a support that also has bounded genus. Our results are a generalization of the results of Raman and Ray (Rajiv Raman, Saurabh Ray: Constructing Planar Support for Non-Piercing Regions. Discret. Comput. Geom. 64(3): 1098-1122 (2020)).
  Our techniques imply a unified analysis for packing and covering problems for hypergraphs defined on surfaces of bounded genus. We also describe applications of our results for hypergraph colorings.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetrical traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to identify the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is the number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the corresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\frac{i+2}{2}$. On average, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has a frequency bigger than $\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has a frequency smaller than 2. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge computed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\in [4, n]$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge has its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq [0.3660n + 1.5849]$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.</description>
