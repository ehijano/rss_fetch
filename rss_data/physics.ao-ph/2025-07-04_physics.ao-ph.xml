      <title>Natural experiments from Earth Hour reveal urban night sky being drastically lit up by few decorative buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light pollution, a typically underrecognized environmental issue, has gained attention in recent years. While controlling light pollution requires sustained efforts, Earth Hour offers a unique natural experimental setting to assess temporary lights-out measures. Using photometric and spectroscopic sensors, we observed up to 50% night sky darkening during Earth Hour from 2011 to 2024 in Hong Kong, primarily as a result of a small but critical number of lights-out instances in central business districts, as evidenced by crowd-sourced photography records. Weekend lighting pattern in the city during Earth Hour remained unaffected. The emission reductions mostly occurred in the 445-500, 500-540, and 615-650 nm spectral ranges-corresponding to peak emissions from LED billboard screens- and in the 585-595 nm range, associated with metal halide floodlights used for facades and billboards. Our study identifies these sources as major contributors to urban light pollution. By combining multimodal observations, we offer a comprehensive assessment of light pollution sources and the potential benefits of sustainable lighting practices in urban environments. This research highlights the importance of targeted light pollution mitigation efforts and provides critical insights for policymakers to enhance urban sustainability and human well-being.</description>

      <title>A physics informed neural network approach to simulating ice dynamics governed by the shallow ice approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we develop a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach to simulate ice sheet dynamics governed by the Shallow Ice Approximation. This problem takes the form of a time-dependent parabolic obstacle problem. Prior work has used this approach to address the stationary obstacle problem and here we extend it to the time dependent problem. Through comprehensive 1D and 2D simulations, we validate the model's effectiveness in capturing complex free-boundary conditions. By merging traditional mathematical modeling with cutting-edge deep learning methods, this approach provides a scalable and robust solution for predicting temporal variations in ice thickness. To illustrate this approach in a real world setting, we simulate the dynamics of the Devon Ice Cap, incorporating aerogeophysical data from 2000 and 2018.</description>
