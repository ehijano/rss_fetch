      <title>Identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder through the electroencephalogram complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are reasons to suggest that a number of mental disorders may be related to alteration in the neural complexity (NC). Thus, quantitative analysis of NC could be helpful in classifying mental conditions and clarifying our understanding about them. Here, we have worked with youths, typical and with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whose neural complexity was assessed using q-statistics applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG was recorded while subjects performed the visual Attention Network Test (ANT) based on the OddBall paradigm and during a shortpretask period of resting state. Time intervals of the EEG amplitudes that passed a threshold (signal regularity indicator) were collected from task and pretask signals from each subject. The data were satisfactorily fitted with a stretched $q$-exponential including a power-law prefactor(characterized by the exponent c), thus determining the best $(c, q)$ for each subject, indicative of their individual complexity. We found larger values of $q$ and $c$ in ADHD subjects as compared with the typical subjects both at task and pretask periods, the task values for both groups being larger than at rest. The $c$ parameter was highly specific in relation to DSM diagnosis for inattention, where well-defined clusters were observed. The parameter values were organized in four well-defined clusters in $(c, q)$-space. As expected, the tasks apparently induced greater complexity in neural functional states with likely greater amount of internal information processing. The results suggest that complexity is higher in ADHD subjects than in typical pairs. The distribution of values in the $(c, q)$-space derived from $q$-statistics seems to be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent covariance reveals critical spatio-temporal patterns of synchronized activity in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining advanced theoretical techniques and high-quality data from thousands of simultaneously recorded neurons provide strong support for the hypothesis that neural dynamics operate near the edge of instability across regions in the brain. However, these analyses, as well as related studies, often fail to capture the intricate temporal structure of brain activity as they primarily rely on time-integrated measurements across neurons. In this study, we present a novel framework designed to explore signatures of criticality across diverse frequency bands and construct a much more comprehensive description of brain activity. Additionally, we introduce a method for projecting brain activity onto a basis of spatio-temporal patterns, facilitating time-dependent dimensionality reduction. Applying this framework to a magnetoencephalography dataset, we observe significant differences in both criticality signatures and spatio-temporal activity patterns between healthy subjects and individuals with Parkinson's disease.</description>

      <title>Brain-grounding of semantic vectors improves neural decoding of visual stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing algorithms for accurate and comprehensive neural decoding of mental contents is one of the long-cherished goals in the field of neuroscience and brain-machine interfaces. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of neural decoding by training machine learning models to map brain activity patterns into a semantic vector representation of stimuli. These vectors, hereafter referred as pretrained feature vectors, are usually derived from semantic spaces based solely on image and/or text features and therefore they might have a totally different characteristics than how visual stimuli is represented in the human brain, resulting in limiting the capability of brain decoders to learn this mapping. To address this issue, we propose a representation learning framework, termed brain-grounding of semantic vectors, which fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the neural representation of visual stimuli in the human brain. We trained this model this model with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of 150 different visual stimuli categories, and then performed zero-shot brain decoding and identification analyses on 1) fMRI and 2) magnetoencephalography (MEG). Interestingly, we observed that by using the brain-grounded vectors, the brain decoding and identification accuracy on brain data from different neuroimaging modalities increases. These findings underscore the potential of incorporating a richer array of brain-derived features to enhance performance of brain decoding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Positive Competitive Networks for Sparse Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time firing-rate neural network, the positive firing-rate competitive network (\pfcn), to tackle sparse reconstruction problems with non-negativity constraints. These problems, which involve approximating a given input stimulus from a dictionary using a set of sparse (active) neurons, play a key role in a wide range of domains, including for example neuroscience, signal processing, and machine learning. First, by leveraging the theory of proximal operators, we relate the equilibria of a family of continuous-time firing-rate neural networks to the optimal solutions of sparse reconstruction problems. Then, we prove that the \pfcn is a positive system and give rigorous conditions for the convergence to the equilibrium. Specifically, we show that the convergence: (i) only depends on a property of the dictionary; (ii) is linear-exponential, in the sense that initially the convergence rate is at worst linear and then, after a transient, it becomes exponential. We also prove a number of technical results to assess the contractivity properties of the neural dynamics of interest. Our analysis leverages contraction theory to characterize the behavior of a family of firing-rate competitive networks for sparse reconstruction with and without non-negativity constraints. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach via a numerical example.</description>
