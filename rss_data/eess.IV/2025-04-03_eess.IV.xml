      <title>Diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension by Integrating Multimodal Data with a Hybrid Graph Convolutional and Transformer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential for optimal patient management. Differentiating between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This study develops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed to classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This retrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH, 32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right heart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test set (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training set. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep learning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process multimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH) sequences, and clinical parameters. Our model achieved a performance of Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 +- 0.06(standard deviation) and Accuracy (ACC) = 0.73 +- 0.06 on the test set. The discriminative abilities were as follows: non-PH subjects (AUC = 0.74 +- 0.11), pre-capillary PH (AUC = 0.86 +- 0.06), and post-capillary PH (AUC = 0.83 +- 0.10). It has the potential to support clinical decision-making by effectively integrating multimodal data to assist physicians in making accurate and timely diagnoses.</description>

      <title>Novel sparse PCA method via Runge Kutta numerical method(s) for face recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition is a crucial topic in data science and biometric security, with applications spanning military, finance, and retail industries. This paper explores the implementation of sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the Proximal Gradient method (also known as ISTA) and the Runge-Kutta numerical methods. To address the face recognition problem, we integrate sparse PCA with either the k-nearest neighbor method or the kernel ridge regression method. Experimental results demonstrate that combining sparse PCA-solved via the Proximal Gradient method or the Runge-Kutta numerical approach-with a classification system yields higher accuracy compared to standard PCA. Additionally, we observe that the Runge-Kutta-based sparse PCA computation consistently outperforms the Proximal Gradient method in terms of speed.</description>

      <title>An Integrated AI-Enabled System Using One Class Twin Cross Learning (OCT-X) for Early Gastric Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, remains hampered by the limitations of current diagnostic technologies, leading to high rates of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated system that synergizes advanced hardware and software technologies to balance speed-accuracy. Our study introduces the One Class Twin Cross Learning (OCT-X) algorithm. Leveraging a novel fast double-threshold grid search strategy (FDT-GS) and a patch-based deep fully convolutional network, OCT-X maximizes diagnostic accuracy through real-time data processing and seamless lesion surveillance. The hardware component includes an all-in-one point-of-care testing (POCT) device with high-resolution imaging sensors, real-time data processing, and wireless connectivity, facilitated by the NI CompactDAQ and LabVIEW software. Our integrated system achieved an unprecedented diagnostic accuracy of 99.70%, significantly outperforming existing models by up to 4.47%, and demonstrated a 10% improvement in multirate adaptability. These findings underscore the potential of OCT-X as well as the integrated system in clinical diagnostics, offering a path toward more accurate, efficient, and less invasive early gastric cancer detection. Future research will explore broader applications, further advancing oncological diagnostics. Code is available at https://github.com/liu37972/Multirate-Location-on-OCT-X-Learning.git.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Deep Models for Dermatological Disease Detection: A Study on Instance Selection and Channel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of dermatological disease is an important problem in Mexico according with different studies. Several works in literature use the datasets of different repositories without applying a study of the data behavior, especially in medical images domain. In this work, we propose a methodology to preprocess dermaMNIST dataset in order to improve its quality for the classification stage, where we use lightweight convolutional neural networks. In our results, we reduce the number of instances for the neural network training obtaining a similar performance of models as ResNet.</description>

      <title>A Retina-Inspired Pathway to Real-Time Motion Prediction inside Image Sensors for Extreme-Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to predict motion in real time is fundamental to many maneuvering activities in animals, particularly those critical for survival, such as attack and escape responses. Given its significance, it is no surprise that motion prediction in animals begins in the retina. Similarly, autonomous systems utilizing computer vision could greatly benefit from the capability to predict motion in real time. Therefore, for computer vision applications, motion prediction should be integrated directly at the camera pixel level. Towards that end, we present a retina-inspired neuromorphic framework capable of performing real-time, energy-efficient MP directly within camera pixels. Our hardware-algorithm framework, implemented using GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology, integrates key retinal MP compute blocks, including a biphasic filter, spike adder, nonlinear circuit, and a 2D array for multi-directional motion prediction. Additionally, integrating the sensor and MP compute die using a 3D Cu-Cu hybrid bonding approach improves design compactness by minimizing area usage and simplifying routing complexity. Validated on real-world object stimuli, the model delivers efficient, low-latency MP for decision-making scenarios reliant on predictive visual computation, while consuming only 18.56 pJ/MP in our mixed-signal hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>STPNet: Scale-aware Text Prompt Network for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions plays a critical role in medical image analysis and diagnosis. Traditional segmentation approaches that rely solely on visual features often struggle with the inherent uncertainty in lesion distribution and size. To address these issues, we propose STPNet, a Scale-aware Text Prompt Network that leverages vision-language modeling to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach utilizes multi-scale textual descriptions to guide lesion localization and employs retrieval-segmentation joint learning to bridge the semantic gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Crucially, STPNet retrieves relevant textual information from a specialized medical text repository during training, eliminating the need for text input during inference while retaining the benefits of cross-modal learning. We evaluate STPNet on three datasets: COVID-Xray, COVID-CT, and Kvasir-SEG. Experimental results show that our vision-language approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating textual semantic knowledge into medical image analysis. The code has been made publicly on https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/STPNet.</description>

      <title>Instance Migration Diffusion for Nuclear Instance Segmentation in Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear instance segmentation plays a vital role in disease diagnosis within digital pathology. However, limited labeled data in pathological images restricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance Migration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate more varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and internuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration Module (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process of nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an Internuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear spatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above, IM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts and internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks. Evaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images generated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation performance. Code will be made public later.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ShieldGemma 2, a 4B parameter image content moderation model built on Gemma 3. This model provides robust safety risk predictions across the following key harm categories: Sexually Explicit, Violence \&amp; Gore, and Dangerous Content for synthetic images (e.g. output of any image generation model) and natural images (e.g. any image input to a Vision-Language Model). We evaluated on both internal and external benchmarks to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to LlavaGuard \citep{helff2024llavaguard}, GPT-4o mini \citep{hurst2024gpt}, and the base Gemma 3 model \citep{gemma_2025} based on our policies. Additionally, we present a novel adversarial data generation pipeline which enables a controlled, diverse, and robust image generation. ShieldGemma 2 provides an open image moderation tool to advance multimodal safety and responsible AI development.</description>

      <title>Muographic Image Upsampling with Machine Learning for Built Infrastructure Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The civil engineering industry faces a critical need for innovative non-destructive evaluation methods, particularly for ageing critical infrastructure, such as bridges, where current techniques fall short. Muography, a non-invasive imaging technique, constructs three-dimensional density maps by detecting interactions of naturally occurring cosmic-ray muons within the scanned volume. Cosmic-ray muons provide deep penetration and inherent safety due to their high momenta and natural source. However, the technology's reliance on this source results in constrained muon flux, leading to prolonged acquisition times, noisy reconstructions and image interpretation challenges. To address these limitations, we developed a two-model deep learning approach. First, we employed a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) to perform predictive upsampling of undersampled muography images. Using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), 1-day sampled images matched the perceptual qualities of a 21-day image, while the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) indicated noise improvement equivalent to 31 days of sampling. A second cWGAN-GP model, trained for semantic segmentation, quantitatively assessed the upsampling model's impact on concrete sample features. This model achieved segmentation of rebar grids and tendon ducts, with Dice-S{\o}rensen accuracy coefficients of 0.8174 and 0.8663. Notably, it could mitigate or remove z-plane smearing artifacts caused by muography's inverse imaging problem. Both models were trained on a comprehensive Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulation dataset reflecting realistic civil infrastructure scenarios. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in acquisition speed and image quality, marking a substantial step toward making muography more practical for reinforced concrete infrastructure monitoring applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Study Design: The study outlines the development of an autonomous AI system for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, trained on a vast dataset of over 5 million X rays sourced from healthcare systems across India. This AI system integrates advanced architectures including Vision Transformers, Faster R-CNN, and various U Net models (such as Attention U-Net, U-Net++, and Dense U-Net) to enable comprehensive classification, detection, and segmentation of 75 distinct pathologies. To ensure robustness, the study design includes subgroup analyses across age, gender, and equipment type, validating the model's adaptability and performance across diverse patient demographics and imaging environments.
  Performance: The AI system achieved up to 98% precision and over 95% recall for multi pathology classification, with stable performance across demographic and equipment subgroups. For normal vs. abnormal classification, it reached 99.8% precision, 99.6% recall, and 99.9% negative predictive value (NPV). It was deployed in 17 major healthcare systems in India including diagnostic centers, large hospitals, and government hospitals. Over the deployment period, the system processed over 150,000 scans, averaging 2,000 chest X rays daily, resulting in reduced reporting times and improved diagnostic accuracy.
  Conclusion: The high precision and recall validate the AI's capability as a reliable tool for autonomous normal abnormal classification, pathology localization, and segmentation. This scalable AI model addresses diagnostic gaps in underserved areas, optimizing radiology workflows and enhancing patient care across diverse healthcare settings in India.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformers for End-to-End Vision-Based Quadrotor Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of an attention-based end-to-end approach for high-speed vision-based quadrotor obstacle avoidance in dense, cluttered environments, with comparison to various state-of-the-art learning architectures. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous maneuverability when flown fast; however, as flight speed increases, traditional model-based approaches to navigation via independent perception, mapping, planning, and control modules breaks down due to increased sensor noise, compounding errors, and increased processing latency. Thus, learning-based, end-to-end vision-to-control networks have shown to have great potential for online control of these fast robots through cluttered environments. We train and compare convolutional, U-Net, and recurrent architectures against vision transformer (ViT) models for depth image-to-control in high-fidelity simulation, observing that ViT models are more effective than others as quadrotor speeds increase and in generalization to unseen environments, while the addition of recurrence further improves performance while reducing quadrotor energy cost across all tested flight speeds. We assess performance at speeds of up to 7m/s in simulation and hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize vision transformers for end-to-end vision-based quadrotor control.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Enhanced Multi-view Multi-modal Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Brain-wide Imaging Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain transcriptomics provides insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the brain coordinates its functions and processes. However, existing multimodal methods for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily rely on imaging and sometimes genetic data, often neglecting the transcriptomic basis of brain. Furthermore, while striving to integrate complementary information between modalities, most studies overlook the informativeness disparities between modalities. Here, we propose TMM, a trusted multiview multimodal graph attention framework for AD diagnosis, using extensive brain-wide transcriptomics and imaging data. First, we construct view-specific brain regional co-function networks (RRIs) from transcriptomics and multimodal radiomics data to incorporate interaction information from both biomolecular and imaging perspectives. Next, we apply graph attention (GAT) processing to each RRI network to produce graph embeddings and employ cross-modal attention to fuse transcriptomics-derived embedding with each imagingderived embedding. Finally, a novel true-false-harmonized class probability (TFCP) strategy is designed to assess and adaptively adjust the prediction confidence of each modality for AD diagnosis. We evaluate TMM using the AHBA database with brain-wide transcriptomics data and the ADNI database with three imaging modalities (AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM-MRI). The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in identifying AD, EMCI, and LMCI compared to state-of-the-arts. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yaolab-fantastic/TMM.</description>
