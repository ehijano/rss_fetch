      <title>Divertor Detachment Characterization in Negative Triangularity Discharges in DIII-D via 2D Edge-Plasma Transport Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge fluid modeling of the first divertor-plasma detachment experiments in negative triangularity discharges on DIII-D is presented using the 2D multi-fluid code UEDGE, including cross-field particle drifts. Density scans are performed to reproduce the experimental roll-over of the outer-target ion saturation current and to investigate detachment physics for both forward and reverse toroidal magnetic field configurations. Consistent with experiments, the simulations show that approximately 40% higher density is required to reach detachment onset for forward BT compared to reverse BT, and that deep detachment is not achieved for reverse BT. Comparisons with positive triangularity Ohmic discharges further demonstrate that negative triangularity requires substantially higher densities, at or above the Greenwald limit, to access detachment. The modeling indicates that the increased difficulty of achieving detachment in negative triangularity arises from a shorter midplane-to-target connection length, a reduced outer divertor leg length, and lower cross-field transport compared to positive triangularity configurations.</description>

      <title>MCPlas, a MATLAB toolbox for reproducible plasma modelling with COMSOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MCPlas toolbox represents a collection of MATLAB functions for the automated generation of an equation-based fluid-Poisson model for non-thermal plasmas in the multiphysics simulation software COMSOL. Following the development of the new generation of the LXCat platform, all input data are prepared in a structured and interoperable JSON format and can be supplied and validated using existing JSON schemas. The toolbox includes fully transparent, editable MATLAB source code and offers an advanced description of electron transport in addition to commonly used approaches in the plasma modelling community. It supports one-dimensional and two-dimensional modelling geometries employing Cartesian, polar and cylindrical coordinate systems. MCPlas is tested on two reference cases: DC- and RF-driven low-pressure glow discharges in argon. Comparison of MCPlas results with results obtained by employing COMSOL's Plasma Module verifies the reliability of the plasma model implemented by MCPlas and demonstrates the significance of electron transport treatment and boundary conditions applied in the toolbox. Using the same examples, the easy handling of complex reaction kinetic models in MCPlas and the reusability of its JSON input data across different modelling platforms are illustrated. This demonstrates that MCPlas provides a transparent and reproducible workflow for the simulation of non-thermal plasmas using COMSOL.</description>

      <title>Electron Density Depletion in Re-Entry Plasma Flows Using Pulsed Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication blackout due to the plasma layer creates a critical telemetry gap for re-entry vehicles. To mitigate this, we present the first fully-coupled simulation of high-voltage pulsed discharges interacting with a Mach 24 flowfield. The results demonstrate that the applied electric field generates a large, non-neutral plasma sheath near the cathode, depleting electron density by several orders of magnitude over a distance commensurate with the height of the shock layer. This depletion window effectively reduces the attenuation of a 4 GHz signal from 60% to 4% with a manageable power requirement of 66 W per cm$^2$ of exposed cathode surface. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the sheath topology is governed principally by ion kinetics; specifically, corrections to ion mobility at high reduced electric fields lead to enhanced space-charge shielding and a subsequent contraction of the sheath. Conversely, the sheath structure is largely insensitive to the electron mobility model. Finally, we argue that the present drift-diffusion model likely yields a conservative lower bound for mitigation performance. A kinetic approach accounting for ballistic ion transport and non-local ionization would likely predict thicker sheaths and lower attenuation for equivalent power deposition.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Analysis of Collective and Non-Collective Thomson Scattering Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostics provide reliable, minimally perturbative measurements of fundamental plasma parameters, such as electron density ($n_e$) and electron temperature ($T_e$). Deep neural networks can provide accurate estimates of $n_e$ and $T_e$ when conventional fitting algorithms may fail, such as when TS spectra are dominated by noise, or when fast analysis is required for real-time operation. Although deep neural networks typically require large training sets, transfer learning can improve model performance on a target task with limited data by leveraging pre-trained models from related source tasks, where select hidden layers are further trained using target data. We present five architecturally diverse deep neural networks, pre-trained on synthetic TS data and adapted for experimentally measured TS data, to evaluate the efficacy of transfer learning in estimating $n_e$ and $T_e$ in both the collective and non-collective scattering regimes. We evaluate errors in $n_e$ and $T_e$ estimates as a function of training set size for models trained with and without transfer learning, and we observe decreases in model error from transfer learning when the training set contains $\lessapprox$ 200 experimentally measured spectra.</description>

      <title>Growth of Phaseolus vulgaris in Response to Seed Priming by Plasma-Activated Water in Laboratory Screening and Outdoor Pot Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores plasma-activated water (PAW) effects on Common bean growth in laboratory and pot trials. Three treatments were assessed: PAW priming, spraying, and their combination. Laboratory trials showed no germination improvement. However, pot trials revealed notable increases in seedling length, biomass, and antioxidant enzyme activity. Enzymes SOD, G-POX, CAT, APX, and GR showed significantly higher activity in PAW-treated plants. These effects were linked to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in PAW. Findings suggest PAW enhances bean growth and physiology, supporting field farming applications.</description>

      <title>Nondiffusive transport of inertial heavy impurities in drift-wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport behavior of tungsten impurities with finite inertia in drift-wave turbulence using the Hasegawa-Wakatani model. Unlike previous tracer-based models, our simulations reveal a transition to non-diffusive dynamics for a range of charge states. This novel mechanism offers a turbulence-driven route to core impurity accumulation. This finding underscores the nontrivial role of particle inertia in impurity dynamics and has strong implications for impurity control in future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Study of the impact of fast ions on core turbulence at rational surfaces via global gyrokinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the interplay between fast ions and safety factor rational surfaces is studied in a turbulent plasma via global nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. Initially, the fast particles-induced enhancement of shearing structures from turbulence self-interaction is analyzed. Our study takes into account the competition between this mechanism and other fast ions effects, i.e. thermal profiles dilution and quasi-resonant interaction. We find the fast ions-induced reduction of destabilization threshold for the zonal modes to be a very efficient way to suppress turbulence. Indeed, it leads to the formation of regions where turbulent transport is reduced by 90\% of its original value. Furthermore, an $n=m=1$ fishbone is driven unstable inside the plasma and its interaction with turbulence is studied. We find the beat-driven zonal structure generate by this mode to further reduce turbulence when its presence does not drastically flatten the thermal profiles.</description>

      <title>Non-Inductive Current Start-Up Using Multi-Harmonic Electron Cyclotron Wave and Current Ramp-Up Through Combined Electron Cyclotron Wave and Ohmic Heating in EXL-50U Spherical Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-inductive current start-up by multi-harmonic electron cyclotron wave has been systematically investigated in the EXL-50U spherical torus. Significant enhancements of the driven current with increasing number of resonance layers have been demonstrated by variation of the number of harmonic resonance layers of the ECW through adjustment of the magnetic field or plasma cross section. The critical role of multi-harmonic ECW in enhancing the driven current has been experimentally verified for the first time. To explain the related experimental observations, a physical mechanism involving multi-harmonic heating, multiple reflections, and multi-pass absorption - leading to the generation of high-energy electrons via X-mode wave or electron Bernstein wave has been proposed. The current drive capacity of the first harmonic extraordinary mode of the ECW has also been experimentally confirmed for the first time. After the application of Ohmic heating during the current ramp-up phase, the current drive efficiency of ECW is further enhanced. Leveraging the synergistic effect between ECW and Ohmic heating, EXL-50U achieved a plasma current of 1 MA, with the non-inductively driven current fraction reaching 70%.</description>

      <title>Magnetically confined charged particles: From steep density profiles to the breaking of the adiabatic invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the stability of Vlasov equilibrium solutions for magnetically confined plasmas, derived through the principle of maximum entropy. By treating the toroidal limit as a perturbation from an analytical cylindrical solution, we demonstrate that these equilibria align well with the inviscid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description. Using the aspect ratio as a perturbation parameter, we compute particle trajectories sampled from the kinetic equilibrium distribution, confirming the overall stability of the solutions. However, under burning plasma conditions, chaotic dynamics emerge for particles with supra-thermal and even thermal energies. This destroys the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment. The exact consequences are unclear, but they could undermine the foundational assumptions of gyrokinetic modelling in burning plasmas. Nevertheless, these results suggest the possibility of unaccounted transport losses in future burning plasma operations. The interplay between turbulence and energetic particles in the presence of Hamiltonian chaos certainly warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Generation of near GeV protons by tightly focused laser interacting with down-ramp density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19341v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 {\mu}m), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 {\mu}m). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the characteristics of a relativistic electron beam based on laser wake-field acceleration using a non-symmetric gas target profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-energy, high-charge, electron source produced by the irradiation of a novel gaseous target by an ultra-intense femtosecond laser pulse. By exploiting a nonsymmetrical nozzle, we increased the total charge of the electron beam by at least an order of magnitude with respect to our previous experiments using symmetrical nozzles. In addition, the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons was enhanced by a factor of two. The electrons are accelerated via the Laser Wake-Field Acceleration mechanism. Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that electrons are injected via the ionization and the downramp injection mechanisms. Our measurements indicate that the demonstrated electron source is a considerable candidate for high dose, Very High Energy Electrons applications, such as radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Energetically-dominant Sunward-Propagating Alfv\'en Waves Near 1 au and Their Relation to Large-scale Magnetic Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\'en waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\'en waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.</description>

      <title>In situ axion generation and detection in laser-plasma wakefield interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a laser-plasma wakefield interaction based scheme for in situ axion generation and detection through the Primakoff process.
  Strong electromagnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^{11}$\,V/m) in the wakefield can enhance axion production rates by 2 orders of magnitude compared to conventional light-shining-through-a-wall experiments. By replacing the axion generation stage with laser-wakefield interaction, the axion-photon coupling constraints can achieve the level of $\gagg \sim 10^{-10}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass less than 0.1\,meV.
  Besides, the generated axions can convert back into photons in the background fields, leading to axion-regenerated electromagnetic fields (AREM) with unique polarization, frequency, and transverse modes.
  This provides a new promising way to search axions by detecting the filtered AREM fields from the background laser and plasma fields.</description>

      <title>Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. The non-reconnecting evolution of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ was known in systems that depend on only two spatial coordinates. That result is extended to systems that depend on all three spatial coordinates. In three dimensional space, the practical importance of the non-reconnecting evolution of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ appears limited. When the evolution velocity of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is chaotic, reconnection naturally occurs on a timescale that depends only logarithmically on any non-ideal effect that is diffusive, such as resistivity.</description>

Abstract: Large-amplitude slow-mode waves are commonly observed near Earth's magnetopause. Recent observations show that these waves can occur simultaneously with kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves. The amplitude of the ion acoustic waves is enhanced near the magnetic field peaks of the slow-mode wave, suggesting that the slow-mode waves may drive the generation of ion acoustic waves. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a hybrid simulation using observation-based parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that large-amplitude slow-mode waves generate counter-streaming ion beams, which in turn excite ion acoustic waves and relax the ion beams. Our study reveals a clear energy transfer channel from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Beam-tracing and profile evolution for localised beams in inhomogeneous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the beam tracing and profile evolution for the propagation of any localised beam with arbitrary profile through an inhomogeneous cold plasma. We recover standard Gaussian beam-tracing, with an additional PDE describing the evolution of the beam's profile as it propagates through the plasma. We then solve for generic families of solutions to the PDE using ladder operators, which can be chosen to reduce to Gauss-Hermite beams in homogeneous media. We importantly obtain an exact expression for the resulting beam profile, demonstrating that Hermite modes will generally evolve into a superposition of different modes during propagation through inhomogeneous plasmas, contrary to prior work on the subject. Importantly, this approach facilitates future analysis of the diagnostic signal received from arbitrary beams.</description>

      <title>Conceptual design of Thomson scattering system with high wavelength resolution in magnetically confined plasmas for electron phase-space measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the conceptual design of a spatially-resolved spectroscopy system of Thomson scattering with high wavelength resolution capable of measuring the shape of electron velocity distribution functions in magnetically confined plasmas. We design a spatially-resolved spectrometer with 2560 wavelength channels. The estimated number of scattered photons in a single spectrometer channel is much larger than unity under the experimental setup and plasma parameters of the Compact Helical Device (CHD), indicating sufficient photon statistics for single-shot measurements. Simulations of the scattered spectra show that the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 5 even under the most unfavorable conditions expected in CHD at full spectral resolution, and further improves with post-processing pixel binning. Bayesian inference applied to the simulated spectra demonstrates that the inferred plasma parameters agree with the input values within the estimated uncertainties. Comparisons between spectra generated from non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions and their Maxwellian fits indicate that deviations from Maxwellian distributions can be identified using the proposed system.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (&gt; 5{\sigma}) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Chapman's Hydrostatic Solar Wind Mechanism in Parker's Hydrodynamic Solar Wind Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global role of Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is investigated by using the de Laval nozzle analogy for the generation of flow acceleration in the latter model. The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the actual wind channel area via a multiplicative factor, which is precisely Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models as well as an n-dimensional (n= 1, 2, 3) underlying space for the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Wave Generation in Two-Dimensional MXenes under Femtosecond Pulsed Laser Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient generation of terahertz (THz) waves in two-dimensional (2D) MXene layers driven by near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses is demonstrated through predictive simulations. Employing a novel hydrodynamic model that self-consistently captures nonlinearities from electric, magnetic, and convective interactions with a minimal set of material parameters. The coupled hydrodynamic-Maxwell equations are solved via finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of laser-induced carriers and THz emission. The results reveal strong, tunable THz output dependent on laser (intensity, polarization, incidence angle), material (composition, carrier density, temperature), and struc-tural (layer thickness, substrate) parameters. These predictions offer verifiable guidelines for experiments and position MXenes as versatile platforms for compact, broadband THz sources in on-chip photonics and 6G communications. This work establishes a robust, self-contained framework for modeling ultrafast nonlinear optics in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Reconnection-driven Flares in M87*: Proton-Synchrotron-powered GeV Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5%-20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.</description>
