      <title>Unraveling Global Threads: Pandemic, Geopolitical Conflict, and Resilience in Fashion and Textile Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several noteworthy scenarios emerged in the global textile and fashion supply chains during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The destabilizing influences of a global pandemic and a geographically localized conflict are being acutely noticed in the worldwide fashion and textile supply chains. This work examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russo-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Palestine conflict, and Indo-Pak conflict on supply chains within the textile and fashion industry. This research employed a content analysis method to identify relevant articles and news from sources such as Google Scholar, the Summon database of North Carolina State University, and the scholarly news portal NexisUni. The selected papers, news articles, and reports provide a comprehensive overview of the fashion, textile, and apparel supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, accompanied by discussions from common supply chain perspectives. Disruptions due to COVID-19 include international brands and retailers canceling orders, closures of stores and factories in developing countries, layoffs, and furloughs of workers in both retail stores and supplier factories, the increased prominence of online and e-commerce businesses, the growing importance of automation and digitalization in the fashion supply chain, considerations of sustainability, and the need for a resilient supply chain system to facilitate post-pandemic recovery. In the case of the Russo-Ukraine war, Israel-Palestine war, and Indo-Pak war, the second-order effects of the conflict have had a more significant impact on the textile supply chain than the direct military operations themselves. In addition to these topics, the study delves into the potential strategies for restoring and strengthening the fashion supply chain</description>

      <title>Satellite and Mobile Phone Data Reveal How Violence Affects Seasonal Migration in Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonal migration plays a critical role in stabilizing rural economies and sustaining the livelihoods of agricultural households. Violence and civil conflict have long been thought to disrupt these labor flows, but this hypothesis has historically been hard to test given the lack of reliable data on migration in conflict zones. Focusing on Afghanistan in the 8-year period prior to the Taliban's takeover in 2021, we first demonstrate how satellite imagery can be used to infer the timing of the opium harvest, which employs a large number of seasonal workers in relatively well-paid jobs. We then use a dataset of nationwide mobile phone records to characterize the migration response to this harvest, and examine whether and how violence and civil conflict disrupt this migration. We find that, on average, districts with high levels of poppy cultivation receive significantly more seasonal migrants than districts with no poppy cultivation. These labor flows are surprisingly resilient to idiosyncratic violent events at the source or destination, including extreme violence resulting in large numbers of fatalities. However, seasonal migration is affected by longer-term patterns of conflict, such as the extent of Taliban control in origin and destination locations.</description>

      <title>Factors Influencing Change Orders in Horizontal Construction Projects: A Comparative Analysis of Unit Price and Lump Sum Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change orders (COs) are a common occurrence in construction projects, leading to increased costs and extended durations. Design-Bid-Build (DBB) projects, favored by state transportation agencies (STAs), often experience a higher frequency of COs compared to other project delivery methods. This study aims to identify areas of improvement to reduce CO frequency in DBB projects through a quantitative analysis. Historical bidding data from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) was utilized to evaluate five factors, contracting technique, project location, type of work, project size, and duration, on specific horizontal construction projects. Two DBB contracting techniques, Unit Price (UP) and Lump Sum (LS), were evaluated using a discrete choice model. The analysis of 581 UP and 189 LS projects revealed that project size, duration, and type of work had a statistically significant influence on the frequency of change orders at a 95% confidence level. The discrete choice model showed significant improvement in identifying the appropriate contract type for a specific project compared to traditional methods used by STAs. By evaluating the contracting technique instead of project delivery methods for horizontal construction projects, the use of DBB can be enhanced, leading to reduced change orders for STAs.</description>

      <title>The gradual transformation of inland countries -- human plowing, horse plowing and equity incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern countries have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by expected value and variance. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>

      <title>Beyond Code: The Multidimensional Impacts of Large Language Models in Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge exchange among developers, dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers' onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition, together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism with a Quantitative Trade Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the economic and environmental impacts of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). We develop a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model with input-output linkages and characterise the general equilibrium response of trade flows, welfare and emissions. As far as we know, this is the first quantitative trade model that jointly endogenises the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) allowances and CBAM prices. We find that the CBAM increases by 0.005\% the EU Gross National Expenditure (GNE), while trade shifts towards domestic cleaner production. Notably, emissions embodied in EU imports fall by 3\%, which is the result of a direct effect (-4.8\%) and a supply chain's upstream substitution effect (+1.8\%). The latter is a dampening effect that we can detect only by explicitly incorporating the production network. In contrast, extra-EU countries experience a slight decline in GNE (0.009\%) and emissions (0.11\%).</description>

      <title>Autonomy by Design: Preserving Human Autonomy in AI Decision-Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy: skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain) and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.</description>
