      <title>Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix Approach for Nuclear Detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current efforts to detect nuclear detonations and correctly categorize explosion sources with ground- and space-collected discriminants presents challenges that remain unaddressed by the Event Categorization Matrix (ECM) model. Smaller events (lower yield explosions) often include only sparse observations among few modalities and can therefore lack a complete set of discriminants. The covariance structures can also vary significantly between such observations of event (source-type) categories. Both obstacles are problematic for ``classic'' ECM. Our work addresses this gap and presents a Bayesian update to the previous ECM model, termed B-ECM, which can be trained on partial observations and does not rely on a pooled covariance structure. We further augment ECM with Bayesian Decision Theory so that false negative or false positive rates of an event categorization can be reduced in an intuitive manner. To demonstrate improved categorization rates with B-ECM, we compare an array of B-ECM and classic ECM models with multiple performance metrics that leverage Monte Carlo experiments. We use both synthetic and real data. Our B-ECM models show consistent gains in overall accuracy and a lower false negative rates relative to the classic ECM model. We propose future avenues to improve B-ECM that expand its decision-making and predictive capability.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Seismology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates machine learning, particularly deep learning, with physics theory to understand and predict complex natural phenomena. By incorporating physical knowledge, SciML reduces the dependency on observational data, which is often limited in the natural sciences. In this article, the fundamental concepts of SciML, its applications in seismology, and prospects are described. Specifically, two popular methods are mainly discussed: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). PINNs can address both forward and inverse problems by incorporating governing laws into the loss functions. The use of PINNs is expanding into areas such as simultaneous solutions of differential equations, inference in underdetermined systems, and regularization based on physics. These research directions would broaden the scope of deep learning in natural sciences. NOs are models designed for operator learning, which deals with relationships between infinite-dimensional spaces. NOs show promise in modeling the time evolution of complex systems based on observational or simulation data. Since large amounts of data are often required, combining NOs with physics-informed learning holds significant potential. Finally, SciML is considered from a broader perspective beyond deep learning: statistical (or mathematical) frameworks that integrate observational data with physical principles to model natural phenomena. In seismology, mathematically rigorous Bayesian statistics has been developed over the past decades, whereas more flexible and scalable deep learning has only emerged recently. Both approaches can be considered as part of SciML in a broad sense. Theoretical and practical insights in both directions would advance SciML methodologies and thereby deepen our understanding of earthquake phenomena.</description>

      <title>Discovery and inversion of the viscoelastic wave equation in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scientific machine learning, the task of identifying partial differential equations accurately from sparse and noisy data poses a significant challenge. Current sparse regression methods may identify inaccurate equations on sparse and noisy datasets and are not suitable for varying coefficients. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid framework that combines two alternating direction optimization phases: discovery and embedding. The discovery phase employs current well-developed sparse regression techniques to preliminarily identify governing equations from observations. The embedding phase implements a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN), enabling efficient processes for time-space iterations involved in discretized forms of wave equation. The RCNN model further optimizes the imperfect sparse regression results to obtain more accurate functional terms and coefficients. Through alternating update of discovery-embedding phases, essential physical equations can be robustly identified from noisy and low-resolution measurements. To assess the performance of proposed framework, numerical experiments are conducted on various scenarios involving wave equation in elastic/viscoelastic and homogeneous/inhomogeneous media. The results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent robustness and accuracy, even when faced with high levels of noise and limited data availability in both spatial and temporal domains.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Characterization of Near-Surface Velocity Structure(s) in the San Francisco Bay Area: A Stationary and Spatially Varying Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the development of two new sedimentary velocity models for the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA) to improve the near-surface characterization of shear-wave velocity ($V_S$), with the ultimate goal of enhancing the Bay Area community velocity model. A stationary model, based solely on $V_{S30}$, and a spatially varying model incorporating location-specific adjustments were developed using a dataset of 200 measured $V_S$ profiles. Both models were formulated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, using a parameterization that ensures robust scaling. The spatially varying model includes a slope adjustment term modeled as a Gaussian process to capture site-specific effects based on location. Residual analysis shows that both models are unbiased up to $V_S$ values of 1000 m/sec. Along-depth variability models were also developed using within-profile residuals. Applying the proposed models in the SFBA results in an increase in $V_S$ in the San Jose area and east of the Hayward Fault, supporting simulations that suggest over-amplification in these regions compared to observations. Goodness-of-fit (GOF) comparisons using linear site-response analyses demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the USGS model in capturing near-surface amplification across a broad frequency range. Incorporating along-depth variability further improves GOF scores by reducing over-amplification at high frequencies. These results underscore the importance of integrating community velocity models with detailed sedimentary velocity models to enhance regional seismic hazard assessments.</description>
