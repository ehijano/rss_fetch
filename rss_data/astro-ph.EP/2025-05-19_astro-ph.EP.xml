      <title>Exoplanet Detection with Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing is the method of exoplanet detection that discovers solar system analog exoplanets. These are planets low in mass located in wide orbits around their host stars. Even though thousands of exoplanets are discovered, they are mostly hot planets close to their hosts. There is a dearth of exoplanets discovered beyond the snowline where exoplanets are thought to be formed. This was recognized as a very important science issue; 2010 decadal survey declared detecting exoplanets with microlensing and measuring their masses as one of the three main science goals of NASA's next flagship mission, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in late 2026, no later than May 2027. It will observe 6 seasons of galactic bulge to discover and measure masses of 1000+ such wide orbit low mass solar system analog planets.</description>

      <title>Interior and Climate Modeling of the Venus Zone Planet TOI-2285 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the discovery of exoplanets progresses at a rapid pace, the large number of known planets provides a pathway to assess the stellar and planetary properties that govern the climate evolution of terrestrial planets. Of particular interest are those planetary cases that straddle the radius boundary of being terrestrial or gaseous in nature, such as super-Earth and sub-Neptune exoplanets, respectively. The known exoplanet, TOI-2285 b, is one such case, since it lies at the radius boundary of super-Earth and sub-Neptune ($R_p = 1.74$ $R_\oplus$), and receives a relatively high instellation flux since its orbit exists within both the Habitable Zone (HZ) and Venus Zone (VZ). Here, we present an analysis of the planetary interior and climate to determine possible evolutionary pathways for the planet. We provide volatile inventory estimates in terms of the planet's bulk density and interior composition. We performed climate simulations using ROCKE-3D that provide a suite of possible temperate scenarios for the planet for a range of topographical and initial surface water assumptions. Using the outputs of the climate simulations, we modeled JWST transmission and emission spectroscopy for each scenario. Our results demonstrate that there are temperate scenarios consistent with the known planetary properties, despite the planet's estimated steam atmosphere, and its location relative to the VZ.</description>

      <title>The Atmosphere of Titan in Late Northern Summer from JWST and Keck Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturn's moon Titan undergoes a long annual cycle of 29.45 Earth years. Titan's northern winter and spring were investigated in detail by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft (2004-2017), but the northern summer season remains sparsely studied. Here we present new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Keck II telescope made in 2022 and 2023 during Titan's late northern summer. Using JWST's mid-infrared instrument, we spectroscopically detected the methyl radical, the primary product of methane break-up and key to the formation of ethane and heavier molecules. Using the near-infrared spectrograph onboard JWST, we detected several non-local thermodynamic equilibrium CO and CO2 emission bands, which allowed us to measure these species over a wide altitude range. Lastly, using the near-infrared camera onboard JWST and Keck II, we imaged northern hemisphere tropospheric clouds evolving in altitude, which provided new insights and constraints on seasonal convection patterns. These observations pave the way for new observations and modelling of Titan's climate and meteorology as it progresses through the northern fall equinox, when its atmosphere is expected to show notable seasonal changes.</description>

      <title>Stellar Obliquity of the Ultra-Short-Period Planet System HD 93963</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect of the transiting planet HD 93963 Ac, a mini-Neptune planet orbiting a G0-type star with an orbital period of $P_{\rm{c}} = 3.65\,\mathrm{d}$, accompanied by an inner super-Earth planet with $P_{\rm{b}} = 1.04\,\mathrm{d}$. We observed a full transit of planet c on 2024 May 3rd UT with Keck/KPF. The observed RM effect has an amplitude of $\sim 1\,\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}$ and implies a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda = 14^{+17}_{-19}$ degrees for HD 93963 Ac. Our dynamical analysis suggests that the two inner planets are likely well aligned with the stellar spin, to within a few degrees, thus allowing both to transit. Along with WASP-47, 55 Cnc, and HD 3167, HD 93963 is the fourth planetary system with an ultra-short-period planet and obliquity measurement(s) of any planet(s) in the system. HD 93963, WASP-47, and 55 Cnc favor largely coplanar orbital architectures, whereas HD 3167 has been reported to have a large mutual inclination ($\sim$100$^\circ$) between its transiting planets b and c. In this configuration, the probability that both planets transit is low. Moreover, one planet would quickly evolve to be non-transiting due to nodal precession. Future missions such as ESO/PLATO should detect the resulting transit duration variations. We encourage additional obliquity measurements of the HD 3167 system to better constrain its orbital architecture.</description>

      <title>Cloudy mornings and clear evenings on a giant extrasolar world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosols are common in exoplanet atmospheres, but their formation-whether through gas condensation or photochemical reactions-remains uncertain. We report a 6$\sigma$ detection of limb asymmetry in the transmission spectrum of WASP-94A b, revealing a cloud-covered (11$\sigma$) cooler morning limb and a clear hotter evening limb with strong H$_2$O absorption (10$\sigma$). Models suggest cloud droplets formed near mbar pressures are lofted to 0.01 mbar by strong vertical dynamics in the morning limb. They evaporate when circulated to the hotter evening limb, requiring a minimum 280 K (3$\sigma$) limb-to-limb temperature difference. We confirm that aerosols in hot Jupiters like WASP-94A b can have clouds cycling between day and night sides instead of photochemical hazes. Ignoring these effects severely biases inferred chemical abundances, showing limb-resolved spectroscopy is critical for characterizing the formation mechanisms of transiting exoplanets-from gas giants to terrestrial exoplanets, indicating the need to reassess inferences from a decade's worth of Hubble Space Telescope observations.</description>

      <title>Conceptual framework for the application of deep neural networks to surface composition reconstruction from Mercury's exospheric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface information derived from exospheric measurements at planetary bodies complements surface mapping provided by dedicated imagers, offering critical insights into surface release processes, interactions within the planetary environment, space weathering, and planetary evolution. This study explores the feasibility of deriving Mercury's regolith elemental composition from in-situ measurements of its neutral exosphere using deep neural networks (DNNs). We present a supervised feed-forward DNN architecture - a multilayer perceptron (MLP) - that, starting from exospheric densities and proton precipitation fluxes, predicts the chemical elements of the surface regolith below. It serves as an estimator for the surface-exosphere interaction and the processes leading to exosphere formation. Because the DNN requires a comprehensive exospheric dataset not available from previous missions, this study uses simulated exosphere components and simulated drivers. Extensive training and testing campaigns demonstrate the MLP's ability to accurately predict and reconstruct surface composition maps from these simulated measurements. Although this initial version does not aim to reproduce Mercury's actual surface composition, it provides a proof of concept, showcasing the algorithm's robustness and capacity for handling complex datasets to create estimators for exospheric generation models. Moreover, our tests reveal substantial potential for further development, suggesting that this method could significantly enhance the analysis of complex surface-exosphere interactions and complement planetary exosphere models. This work anticipates applying the approach to data from the BepiColombo mission, specifically the SERENA package, whose nominal phase begins in 2027.</description>

      <title>Absence of a Runaway Greenhouse Limit on Lava Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate transitions on exoplanets offer valuable insights into the atmospheric processes governing planetary habitability. Previous pure-steam atmospheric models show a thermal limit in outgoing long-wave radiation, which has been used to define the inner edge of the classical habitable zone and guide exoplanet surveys aiming to identify and characterize potentially habitable worlds. We expand upon previous modelling by treating (i) the dissolution of volatiles into a magma ocean underneath the atmosphere, (ii) a broader volatile range of the atmospheric composition including H2O, CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and N2, and (iii) a surface temperature- and mantle redox-dependent equilibrium chemistry. We find that multi-component atmospheres of outgassed composition located above partially or fully-molten mantles do not exhibit the characteristic thermal radiation limit that arises from pure-steam models, thereby undermining the canonical concept of a runaway greenhouse limit, and hence challenging the conventional approach of using it to define an irradiation-based habitable zone. Our results show that atmospheric heat loss to space is strongly dependent on the oxidation and melting state of the underlying planetary mantle, through their significant influence on the atmosphere's equilibrium composition. This suggests an evolutionary hysteresis in climate scenarios: initially molten and cooling planets do not converge to the same climate regime as solidified planets that heat up by external irradiation. Steady-state models cannot recover evolutionary climate transitions, which instead require self-consistent models of the temporal evolution of the coupled feedback processes between interior and atmosphere over geologic time.</description>

      <title>Tracing the formation and migration history: molecular signatures in the atmosphere of misaligned hot Jupiter WASP-94Ab using JWST NIRSpec/G395H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their host stars has long challenged traditional models of planetary formation and migration. Characterising their atmospheric composition - mainly in the form of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity - can provide insights into their formation locations and evolution pathways. With JWST we can characterise the atmospheres of these types of planets more precisely than previously possible, primarily because it allows us to determine both their atmospheric oxygen and carbon composition. Here, we present a JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum from 2.8-5.1$\mu m$ of WASP-94Ab, an inflated hot Jupiter with a retrograde misaligned orbit around its F-type host star. We find a relatively cloud-free atmosphere, with absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ at detection significances of $\sim 4\sigma$ and $\sim 11\sigma$, respectively. In addition, we detect tentative evidence of CO absorption at $\sim3\sigma$, as well as hints of sulphur with the detection of H$_2$S at a $\sim 2.5\sigma$ confidence level. Our favoured equilibrium chemistry model determines a C/O ratio of $0.49^{+0.08}_{-0.13}$ for WASP-94Ab's atmosphere, which is substellar compared to the star's C/O ratio of $0.68 \pm 0.10$. The retrieved atmospheric metallicity is similar to the star's metallicity as both are $\sim 2\times$ solar. We find that this sub-stellar C/O ratio and stellar metallicity can be best explained by pebble accretion or planetesimal accretion in combination with large-distance migration of the planet.</description>

      <title>Evolution of granular salty ice analogs for Europa: Sublimation and Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the Vis-NIR reflectance spectrum of salty granular ice analog samples in a simulation chamber under conditions relevant to the surface of Europa. A novel application and custom calibration of a thermopile sensor enabled the measurement of the surface temperature of the samples in far infrared emission. This allows the kinetics of the observed changes to be scaled to equivalent timescales on Europa. We observed significant changes in the depth and shape of the broad water absorption bands for all samples on timescales of a few thousand years of equatorial conditions on Europa. This effect should be taken into account if quantitative predictions about bulk composition are made based on remote-sensing data. A narrow absorption feature attributed to hydrohalite formed during the sublimation of the sodium chloride sample. We used near-infrared spectroscopy in an irradiation chamber to assess the stability of this narrow feature under electron irradiation. We find that the radiation environment present on Europa dehydrates the hydrohalite on short timescales. Therefore, we expect hydrohalite not to be present on the surface, unless erupted very recently (&lt; 10 yr) or located in thermal anomalies (&gt; 145 K). Thus, a detection of hydrohalite would clearly indicate recent activity.</description>

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>Revisiting the bimodality of galactic habitability in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of galaxies to host habitable planets is central to astrobiology, tightly linked to galaxy-scale evolution and cosmological processes. Using IllustrisTNG, we revisit the proposed local peak in the mass-metallicity relation for small, metal-rich, star-forming galaxies (Cloudlet) as an indicator of enhanced galactic habitability. We refine the earlier analysis by applying updated filtering criteria to identify a more refined sample, further selecting objects based on their history. This process resulted in a confirmed sample of 97 dwarf galaxies, alongside 519 additional structures of uncertain origin, potentially comprising both numerical artefacts and unrecognised physical systems. Under these stricter conditions, the proposed bimodality in galactic habitability is strongly diminished. However, the astrobiological potential of metal-rich dwarfs, most of which are compact remnants of more massive galaxies that underwent tidal stripping, is a thrilling area of exploration. Although dense stellar environments are traditionally seen as inhospitable, recent studies highlight the role of dynamic environments in enhancing the distribution of biological material. Furthermore, the potential habitability of tidal structures formed in the aftermath of galactic interactions is a fascinating possibility. Our findings suggest that non-traditional structures support conditions favourable for life, opening up exciting new avenues for astrobiological research. This research underscores the need for a holistic approach to studying habitability that moves beyond planetary and stellar-focused frameworks to incorporate the broader galactic environment. Understanding the interactions between galaxies, their evolution, and the influence of their surroundings is essential to developing a more comprehensive model of how and where life might emerge and persist across the Universe.</description>

      <title>High-resolution, high-efficiency narrowband spectroscopy with an s-p-phased holographic grating in double pass</title>

Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy (R&gt;50,000) in astronomy typically uses echelle-type spectrographs, which excel for exoplanet detection via radial velocity but compromise throughput for atmospheric characterization. We propose and test a novel method to achieve very high spectral resolution with significantly higher throughput within a limited bandpass using a tuned, high fringe-density volume phase holographic (VPH) grating in double pass. Using a wavelength-tunable laser, we measured the dispersion and diffraction efficiency of this setup, finding that our tested VPH grating reaches a diffraction-limited resolving power &gt;140,000 in double pass with a peak diffraction efficiency of 79% for unpolarized light. Based on current manufacturing capabilities, we estimate double-pass diffraction efficiencies &gt;50% with resolving powers &gt;200,000 are achievable from visible to near-infrared wavelengths, limited only by detector size.</description>

      <title>FUOr-Aur 0544+3330: A New YSO Outburst in the Outskirts of Auriga OB1, Viewed Face-On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11440</link>

Abstract: We present a newly appreciated FU Ori outburst event that began in 2019 and reached a peak in early 2021. Suspected young stellar object WISE J054452.25+333009.6 experienced substantial brightening, in excess of $-5$ mag at optical wavelengths and $-2.5$ mag at mid-infrared wavelengths. The time from near-quiescence to peak brightness was approximately 24 months. Optical and near-infrared spectra confirm that the outbursting source (hereby designated FUOr-Aur 0544+3330) shows all the hallmarks of the FU Ori class, including the Li I indicator of stellar youth. The mix of ionized and neutral atomic lines, alongside prominent molecular absorption features, is consistent with the expected change in spectral type from earlier in the optical to later-type in the near-infrared. The closest analog among well-studied FU Ori objects is V1515 Cyg. Both sources have unusually narrow-lined absorption spectra that can be explained by a face-on disk orientation, such that disk-broadening is minimized and wind-induced blueshift (in e.g. H$\alpha$, NaD, Ca II) is maximized. Both the optical through infrared spectral energy distribution and high-resolution spectrum are well-fit by a pure-accretion disk model. Adopting a distance of $d=1.5$ kpc, the accretion and central star parameters are: $\dot{M} = 10^{-5.48}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_* = 0.17 \ M_\odot$, and $R_\mathrm{inner} = 1.04 \ R_\odot$. Other fitted values are disk inclination $i=5.9$ deg and source extinction $A_V=1.83$ mag. These parameters yield accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc} = 8.4\ L_\odot$ and maximum disk temperature $T_{\rm{max}} = 6218$ K.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity evolution during planet-disc interaction</title>

Abstract: During the process of planet formation, the planet-discs interactions might excite (or damp) the orbital eccentricity of the planet. In this paper, we present two long ($t\sim 3\times 10^5$ orbits) numerical simulations: (a) one (with a relatively light disc, $M_{\rm d}/M_{\rm p}=0.2$) where the eccentricity initially stalls before growing at later times and (b) one (with a more massive disc, $M_{\rm d}/M_{\rm p}=0.65$) with fast growth and a late decrease of the eccentricity. We recover the well-known result that a more massive disc promotes a faster initial growth of the planet eccentricity. However, at late times the planet eccentricity decreases in the massive disc case, but increases in the light disc case. Both simulations show periodic eccentricity oscillations superimposed on a growing/decreasing trend and a rapid transition between fast and slow pericentre precession. The peculiar and contrasting evolution of the eccentricity of both planet and disc in the two simulations can be understood by invoking a simple toy model where the disc is treated as a second point-like gravitating body, subject to secular planet-planet interaction and eccentricity pumping/damping provided by the disc. We show how the counterintuitive result that the more massive simulation produces a lower planet eccentricity at late times can be understood in terms of the different ratios of the disc-to-planet angular momentum in the two simulations. In our interpretation, at late times the planet eccentricity can increase more in low-mass discs rather than in high-mass discs, contrary to previous claims in the literature.</description>

      <title>Influence of Planetary Rotation on Supersonic Flow of Lava Planets: A Two-Dimensional Horizontal Model Analysis</title>

Abstract: The study of lava planets has attracted significant attention recently because of their close proximity to their host stars, which enhances their detectability for atmospheric characterization. Previous studies showed that the atmospheric flow becomes supersonic if the atmosphere was dominated by rocky vapor evaporated from the magma ocean around the substellar point of small lava planets. These studies often assumed an axisymmetric flow about the axis from the substellar point to the antistellar point but ignored the effect of planetary rotation on the climate. The spin rate of lava planets can be rather fast due to their close-in orbits, which can break the aforementioned symmetry and induce the asymmetric flow component. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional framework to explore the influence of planetary rotation on the atmospheric dynamics of these lava planets for the first time, and assess the sensitivity and range of application of our model. Starting from the established one-dimensional axisymmetric atmospheric solution, we obtain the governing equation for the asymmetric flow by expanding with respect to 1/Ro (Ro denotes Rossby number and exceeds unity for typical lava planets). The asymmetric component of supersonic flow is pivotal for future research on the observation of these atmospheres, flow patterns of the magma ocean currents driven by atmospheric winds, and deformation of the planetary shape over long timescales.</description>

      <title>The likelihood of not detecting cavity-carving companions in transition discs -- A statistical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06337</link>

Abstract: Protoplanetary discs with cavities, also known as ``transition discs'', constitute ~10% of protoplanetary discs at sub-mm wavelengths. Among several explanations, one hypothesis suggests these cavities are carved by undetected stellar or planetary companions. We present a novel approach to quantify the likelihood that a cavity-carving companion goes undetected because it is either too close to the star (i.e., has a small projected separation) or too faint to be resolved. We generate two independent samples of stellar and planetary companions with random sky orientations, assuming distributions in eccentricity, mass ratio, and time-weighted orbital phases, to study the statistical properties of the cavities they produce. We calculate the likelihood that a companion appears with a projected separation $d$ relative to its semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ ($d/a_{bin}$). Then, using a disc truncation model, we calculate the likelihood that companions carve a cavity with size $a_{cav}$ relative to its semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ and projected separation $d$, deriving distributions of $a_{bin}/a_{cav}$ and $d/a_{cav}$. We find that stellar companions carve cavities with median sizes ~3 times larger than their projected separation $d$ ($a_{cav}\sim3d$, $a_{cav}\sim1.7 d$ for planets), but with a statistically significant tail towards larger values ($a_{cav}\gg 3d$). We estimate the likelihood that cavity-carving companions go undetected due to projection effects when the system is observed with spatial resolution $R$, $P(d&lt; R)$. Considering observational constraints on companion masses, we apply this framework to 13 well-known transition discs. We find that undetected stellar companions are unlikely in 8 out of 13 systems we considered, with 5 notable exceptions: ABAur, MWC758, HD135344B, CQTau and HD169142. The presence of undetected planets cannot be excluded in any of the transition discs considered.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>
