      <title>Biologically-Plausible Topology Improved Spiking Actor Network for Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is largely attributed to utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as function approximators. Recent advances in neuroscience have unveiled that the human brain achieves efficient reward-based learning, at least by integrating spiking neurons with spatial-temporal dynamics and network topologies with biologically-plausible connectivity patterns. This integration process allows spiking neurons to efficiently combine information across and within layers via nonlinear dendritic trees and lateral interactions. The fusion of these two topologies enhances the network's information-processing ability, crucial for grasping intricate perceptions and guiding decision-making procedures. However, ANNs and brain networks differ significantly. ANNs lack intricate dynamical neurons and only feature inter-layer connections, typically achieved by direct linear summation, without intra-layer connections. This limitation leads to constrained network expressivity. To address this, we propose a novel alternative for function approximator, the Biologically-Plausible Topology improved Spiking Actor Network (BPT-SAN), tailored for efficient decision-making in DRL. The BPT-SAN incorporates spiking neurons with intricate spatial-temporal dynamics and introduces intra-layer connections, enhancing spatial-temporal state representation and facilitating more precise biological simulations. Diverging from the conventional direct linear weighted sum, the BPT-SAN models the local nonlinearities of dendritic trees within the inter-layer connections. For the intra-layer connections, the BPT-SAN introduces lateral interactions between adjacent neurons, integrating them into the membrane potential formula to ensure accurate spike firing.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Recurrent Adapters for Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation of Large Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter efficient adaptation methods have become a key mechanism to train large pre-trained models for downstream tasks. However, their per-task parameter overhead is considered still high when the number of downstream tasks to adapt for is large. We introduce an adapter module that has a better efficiency in large scale multi-task adaptation scenario. Our adapter is hierarchical in terms of how the adapter parameters are allocated. The adapter consists of a single shared controller network and multiple task-level adapter heads to reduce the per-task parameter overhead without performance regression on downstream tasks. The adapter is also recurrent so the entire adapter parameters are reused across different layers of the pre-trained model. Our Hierarchical Recurrent Adapter (HRA) outperforms the previous adapter-based approaches as well as full model fine-tuning baseline in both single and multi-task adaptation settings when evaluated on automatic speech recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Reverse-Engineering the Brain: Brain-Derived Neuromorphic Computing Approach with Photonic, Electronic, and Ionic Dynamicity in 3D integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human brain has immense learning capabilities at extreme energy efficiencies and scale that no artificial system has been able to match. For decades, reverse engineering the brain has been one of the top priorities of science and technology research. Despite numerous efforts, conventional electronics-based methods have failed to match the scalability, energy efficiency, and self-supervised learning capabilities of the human brain. On the other hand, very recent progress in the development of new generations of photonic and electronic memristive materials, device technologies, and 3D electronic-photonic integrated circuits (3D EPIC ) promise to realize new brain-derived neuromorphic systems with comparable connectivity, density, energy-efficiency, and scalability. When combined with bio-realistic learning algorithms and architectures, it may be possible to realize an 'artificial brain' prototype with general self-learning capabilities. This paper argues the possibility of reverse-engineering the brain through architecting a prototype of a brain-derived neuromorphic computing system consisting of artificial electronic, ionic, photonic materials, devices, and circuits with dynamicity resembling the bio-plausible molecular, neuro/synaptic, neuro-circuit, and multi-structural hierarchical macro-circuits of the brain based on well-tested computational models. We further argue the importance of bio-plausible local learning algorithms applicable to the neuromorphic computing system that capture the flexible and adaptive unsupervised and self-supervised learning mechanisms central to human intelligence. Most importantly, we emphasize that the unique capabilities in brain-derived neuromorphic computing prototype systems will enable us to understand links between specific neuronal and network-level properties with system-level functioning and behavior.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity Enhanced Adaptive Activation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simply implemented activation function with even cubic nonlinearity is introduced that increases the accuracy of neural networks without substantial additional computational resources. This is partially enabled through an apparent tradeoff between convergence and accuracy. The activation function generalizes the standard RELU function by introducing additional degrees of freedom through optimizable parameters that enable the degree of nonlinearity to be adjusted. The associated accuracy enhancement is quantified in the context of the MNIST digit data set through a comparison with standard techniques.</description>

      <title>A novel decision fusion approach for sale price prediction using Elastic Net and MOPSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Price prediction algorithms propose prices for every product or service according to market trends, projected demand, and other characteristics, including government rules, international transactions, and speculation and expectation. As the dependent variable in price prediction, it is affected by several independent and correlated variables which may challenge the price prediction. To overcome this challenge, machine learning algorithms allow more accurate price prediction without explicitly modeling the relatedness between variables. However, as inputs increase, it challenges the existing machine learning approaches regarding computing efficiency and prediction effectiveness. Hence, this study introduces a novel decision level fusion approach to select informative variables in price prediction. The suggested metaheuristic algorithm balances two competitive objective functions, which are defined to improve the prediction utilized variables and reduce the error rate simultaneously. To generate Pareto optimal solutions, an Elastic net approach is employed to eliminate unrelated and redundant variables to increase the accuracy. Afterward, we propose a novel method for combining solutions and ensuring that a subset of features is optimal. Two various real datasets evaluate the proposed price prediction method. The results support the suggested superiority of the model concerning its relative root mean square error and adjusted correlation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Attending to Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, transformer architectures for graphs emerged as an alternative to established techniques for machine learning with graphs, such as (message-passing) graph neural networks. So far, they have shown promising empirical results, e.g., on molecular prediction datasets, often attributed to their ability to circumvent graph neural networks' shortcomings, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Here, we derive a taxonomy of graph transformer architectures, bringing some order to this emerging field. We overview their theoretical properties, survey structural and positional encodings, and discuss extensions for important graph classes, e.g., 3D molecular graphs. Empirically, we probe how well graph transformers can recover various graph properties, how well they can deal with heterophilic graphs, and to what extent they prevent over-squashing. Further, we outline open challenges and research direction to stimulate future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/luis-mueller/probing-graph-transformers.</description>

      <title>The Relational Bottleneck as an Inductive Bias for Efficient Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge for cognitive science is to explain how abstract concepts are acquired from limited experience. This has often been framed in terms of a dichotomy between connectionist and symbolic cognitive models. Here, we highlight a recently emerging line of work that suggests a novel reconciliation of these approaches, by exploiting an inductive bias that we term the relational bottleneck. In that approach, neural networks are constrained via their architecture to focus on relations between perceptual inputs, rather than the attributes of individual inputs. We review a family of models that employ this approach to induce abstractions in a data-efficient manner, emphasizing their potential as candidate models for the acquisition of abstract concepts in the human mind and brain.</description>

      <title>Genetic Quantization-Aware Approximation for Non-Linear Operations in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear functions are prevalent in Transformers and their lightweight variants, incurring substantial and frequently underestimated hardware costs. Previous state-of-the-art works optimize these operations by piece-wise linear approximation and store the parameters in look-up tables (LUT), but most of them require unfriendly high-precision arithmetics such as FP/INT 32 and lack consideration of integer-only INT quantization. This paper proposed a genetic LUT-Approximation algorithm namely GQA-LUT that can automatically determine the parameters with quantization awareness. The results demonstrate that GQA-LUT achieves negligible degradation on the challenging semantic segmentation task for both vanilla and linear Transformer models. Besides, proposed GQA-LUT enables the employment of INT8-based LUT-Approximation that achieves an area savings of 81.3~81.7% and a power reduction of 79.3~80.2% compared to the high-precision FP/INT 32 alternatives. Code is available at https:// github.com/PingchengDong/GQA-LUT.</description>
