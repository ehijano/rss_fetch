      <title>NeuroVoz: a Castillian Spanish corpus of parkinsonian speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis through speech analysis is hindered by a notable lack of publicly available, diverse language datasets, limiting the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research.
  In response to this gap, we introduce a comprehensive corpus from 108 native Castilian Spanish speakers, comprising 55 healthy controls and 53 individuals diagnosed with PD, all of whom were under pharmacological treatment and recorded in their medication-optimized state. This unique dataset features a wide array of speech tasks, including sustained phonation of the five Spanish vowels, diadochokinetic tests, 16 listen-and-repeat utterances, and free monologues. The dataset emphasizes accuracy and reliability through specialist manual transcriptions of the listen-and-repeat tasks and utilizes Whisper for automated monologue transcriptions, making it the most complete public corpus of Parkinsonian speech, and the first in Castillian Spanish.
  NeuroVoz is composed by 2,903 audio recordings averaging $26.88 \pm 3.35$ recordings per participant, offering a substantial resource for the scientific exploration of PD's impact on speech. This dataset has already underpinned several studies, achieving a benchmark accuracy of 89% in PD speech pattern identification, indicating marked speech alterations attributable to PD. Despite these advances, the broader challenge of conducting a language-agnostic, cross-corpora analysis of Parkinsonian speech patterns remains an open area for future research. This contribution not only fills a critical void in PD speech analysis resources but also sets a new standard for the global research community in leveraging speech as a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>NaturalSpeech 3: Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis with Factorized Codec and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have achieved significant progress, they still fall short in speech quality, similarity, and prosody. Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g., content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant challenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into individual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them individually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector quantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion model to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding prompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and efficiently model the intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a divide-and-conquer way. Experiments show that NaturalSpeech 3 outperforms the state-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity, prosody, and intelligibility. Furthermore, we achieve better performance by scaling to 1B parameters and 200K hours of training data.</description>

      <title>Enhanced DareFightingICE Competitions: Sound Design and AI Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new and improved DareFightingICE platform, a fighting game platform with a focus on visually impaired players (VIPs), in the Unity game engine. It also introduces the separation of the DareFightingICE Competition into two standalone competitions called DareFightingICE Sound Design Competition and DareFightingICE AI Competition--at the 2024 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)--in which a new platform will be used. This new platform is an enhanced version of the old DareFightingICE platform, having a better audio system to convey 3D sound and a better way to send audio data to AI agents. With this enhancement and by utilizing Unity, the new DareFightingICE platform is more accessible in terms of adding new features for VIPs and future audio research. This paper also improves the evaluation method for evaluating sound designs in the Sound Design Competition which will ensure a better sound design for VIPs as this competition continues to run at future CoG. To the best of our knowledge, both of our competitions are first of their kind, and the connection between the competitions to mutually improve the entries' quality with time makes these competitions an important part of representing an often overlooked segment within the broader gaming community, VIPs.</description>

      <title>Fighting Game Adaptive Background Music for Improved Gameplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our work to enhance the background music (BGM) in DareFightingICE by adding adaptive features. The adaptive BGM consists of three different categories of instruments playing the BGM of the winner sound design from the 2022 DareFightingICE Competition. The BGM adapts by changing the volume of each category of instruments. Each category is connected to a different element of the game. We then run experiments to evaluate the adaptive BGM by using a deep reinforcement learning AI agent that only uses audio as input (Blind DL AI). The results show that the performance of the Blind DL AI improves while playing with the adaptive BGM as compared to playing without the adaptive BGM.</description>

      <title>Single-Channel Robot Ego-Speech Filtering during Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how well human speech can automatically be filtered when this overlaps with the voice and fan noise of a social robot, Pepper. We ultimately aim for an HRI scenario where the microphone can remain open when the robot is speaking, enabling a more natural turn-taking scheme where the human can interrupt the robot. To respond appropriately, the robot would need to understand what the interlocutor said in the overlapping part of the speech, which can be accomplished by target speech extraction (TSE). To investigate how well TSE can be accomplished in the context of the popular social robot Pepper, we set out to manufacture a datase composed of a mixture of recorded speech of Pepper itself, its fan noise (which is close to the microphones), and human speech as recorded by the Pepper microphone, in a room with low reverberation and high reverberation. Comparing a signal processing approach, with and without post-filtering, and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) approach to a state-of-the-art speaker identification-based TSE model, we found that the signal processing approach without post-filtering yielded the best performance in terms of Word Error Rate on the overlapping speech signals with low reverberation, while the CRNN approach is more robust for reverberation. These results show that estimating the human voice in overlapping speech with a robot is possible in real-life application, provided that the room reverberation is low and the human speech has a high volume or high pitch.</description>

      <title>AIx Speed: Playback Speed Optimization Using Listening Comprehension of Speech Recognition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since humans can listen to audio and watch videos at faster speeds than actually observed, we often listen to or watch these pieces of content at higher playback speeds to increase the time efficiency of content comprehension. To further utilize this capability, systems that automatically adjust the playback speed according to the user's condition and the type of content to assist in more efficient comprehension of time-series content have been developed. However, there is still room for these systems to further extend human speed-listening ability by generating speech with playback speed optimized for even finer time units and providing it to humans. In this study, we determine whether humans can hear the optimized speech and propose a system that automatically adjusts playback speed at units as small as phonemes while ensuring speech intelligibility. The system uses the speech recognizer score as a proxy for how well a human can hear a certain unit of speech and maximizes the speech playback speed to the extent that a human can hear. This method can be used to produce fast but intelligible speech. In the evaluation experiment, we compared the speech played back at a constant fast speed and the flexibly speed-up speech generated by the proposed method in a blind test and confirmed that the proposed method produced speech that was easier to listen to.</description>

      <title>Cross Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Audio-Visual Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL) is the task of identifying specific sounding objects in the scene given audio cues. In our work, we focus on semi-supervised AVSL with pseudo-labeling. To address the issues with vanilla hard pseudo-labels including bias accumulation, noise sensitivity, and instability, we propose a novel method named Cross Pseudo-Labeling (XPL), wherein two models learn from each other with the cross-refine mechanism to avoid bias accumulation. We equip XPL with two effective components. Firstly, the soft pseudo-labels with sharpening and pseudo-label exponential moving average mechanisms enable models to achieve gradual self-improvement and ensure stable training. Secondly, the curriculum data selection module adaptively selects pseudo-labels with high quality during training to mitigate potential bias. Experimental results demonstrate that XPL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while effectively mitigating confirmation bias and ensuring training stability.</description>

      <title>Dual Mean-Teacher: An Unbiased Semi-Supervised Framework for Audio-Visual Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL) aims to locate sounding objects within video frames given the paired audio clips. Existing methods predominantly rely on self-supervised contrastive learning of audio-visual correspondence. Without any bounding-box annotations, they struggle to achieve precise localization, especially for small objects, and suffer from blurry boundaries and false positives. Moreover, the naive semi-supervised method is poor in fully leveraging the information of abundant unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for AVSL, namely Dual Mean-Teacher (DMT), comprising two teacher-student structures to circumvent the confirmation bias issue. Specifically, two teachers, pre-trained on limited labeled data, are employed to filter out noisy samples via the consensus between their predictions, and then generate high-quality pseudo-labels by intersecting their confidence maps. The sufficient utilization of both labeled and unlabeled data and the proposed unbiased framework enable DMT to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with CIoU of 90.4% and 48.8% on Flickr-SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source, obtaining 8.9%, 9.6% and 4.6%, 6.4% improvements over self- and semi-supervised methods respectively, given only 3% positional-annotations. We also extend our framework to some existing AVSL methods and consistently boost their performance.</description>

      <title>Zipformer: A faster and better encoder for automatic speech recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Conformer has become the most popular encoder model for automatic speech recognition (ASR). It adds convolution modules to a transformer to learn both local and global dependencies. In this work we describe a faster, more memory-efficient, and better-performing transformer, called Zipformer. Modeling changes include: 1) a U-Net-like encoder structure where middle stacks operate at lower frame rates; 2) reorganized block structure with more modules, within which we re-use attention weights for efficiency; 3) a modified form of LayerNorm called BiasNorm allows us to retain some length information; 4) new activation functions SwooshR and SwooshL work better than Swish. We also propose a new optimizer, called ScaledAdam, which scales the update by each tensor's current scale to keep the relative change about the same, and also explictly learns the parameter scale. It achieves faster convergence and better performance than Adam. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and WenetSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Zipformer over other state-of-the-art ASR models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall.</description>

      <title>Making Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Laugh as You Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laughter is one of the most expressive and natural aspects of human speech, conveying emotions, social cues, and humor. However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the ability to produce realistic and appropriate laughter sounds, limiting their applications and user experience. While there have been prior works to generate natural laughter, they fell short in terms of controlling the timing and variety of the laughter to be generated. In this work, we propose ELaTE, a zero-shot TTS that can generate natural laughing speech of any speaker based on a short audio prompt with precise control of laughter timing and expression. Specifically, ELaTE works on the audio prompt to mimic the voice characteristic, the text prompt to indicate the contents of the generated speech, and the input to control the laughter expression, which can be either the start and end times of laughter, or the additional audio prompt that contains laughter to be mimicked. We develop our model based on the foundation of conditional flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS, and fine-tune it with frame-level representation from a laughter detector as additional conditioning. With a simple scheme to mix small-scale laughter-conditioned data with large-scale pre-training data, we demonstrate that a pre-trained zero-shot TTS model can be readily fine-tuned to generate natural laughter with precise controllability, without losing any quality of the pre-trained zero-shot TTS model. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we show that ELaTE can generate laughing speech with significantly higher quality and controllability compared to conventional models.

      <title>BLAT: Bootstrapping Language-Audio Pre-training based on AudioSet Tag-guided Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared with ample visual-text pre-training research, few works explore audio-text pre-training, mostly due to the lack of sufficient parallel audio-text data. Most existing methods incorporate the visual modality as a pivot for audio-text pre-training, which inevitably induces data noise. In this paper, we propose to utilize audio captioning to generate text directly from audio, without the aid of the visual modality so that potential noise from modality mismatch is eliminated. Furthermore, we propose caption generation under the guidance of AudioSet tags, leading to more accurate captions. With the above two improvements, we curate high-quality, large-scale parallel audio-text data, based on which we perform audio-text pre-training. We comprehensively demonstrate the performance of the pre-trained model on a series of downstream audio-related tasks, including single-modality tasks like audio classification and tagging, as well as cross-modal tasks consisting of audio-text retrieval and audio-based text generation. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot classification performance on most datasets, suggesting the effectiveness of our synthetic data. The audio encoder also serves as an efficient pattern recognition model by fine-tuning it on audio-related tasks. Synthetic data and pre-trained models are available online.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents our work to enhance the background music (BGM) in DareFightingICE by adding an adaptive BGM. The adaptive BGM consists of five different instruments playing a classical music piece called "Air on G-String." The BGM adapts by changing the volume of the instruments. Each instrument is connected to a different element of the game. We then run experiments to evaluate the adaptive BGM by using a deep reinforcement learning AI that only uses audio as input (Blind DL AI). The results show that the performance of the Blind DL AI improves while playing with the adaptive BGM as compared to playing without the adaptive BGM.</description>

      <title>M$^{2}$UGen: Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation with the Power of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current landscape of research leveraging large language models (LLMs) is experiencing a surge. Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of these models to comprehend various modalities, such as text, speech, images, videos, etc. They also utilize LLMs to understand human intention and generate desired outputs like images, videos, and music. However, research that combines both understanding and generation using LLMs is still limited and in its nascent stage. To address this gap, we introduce a Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation (M$^{2}$UGen) framework that integrates LLM's abilities to comprehend and generate music for different modalities. The M$^{2}$UGen framework is purpose-built to unlock creative potential from diverse sources of inspiration, encompassing music, image, and video through the use of pretrained MERT, ViT, and ViViT models, respectively. To enable music generation, we explore the use of AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Bridging multi-modal understanding and music generation is accomplished through the integration of the LLaMA 2 model. Furthermore, we make use of the MU-LLaMA model to generate extensive datasets that support text/image/video-to-music generation, facilitating the training of our M$^{2}$UGen framework. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves or surpasses the performance of the current state-of-the-art models.</description>

Abstract: Zero-shot multi-speaker TTS aims to synthesize speech with the voice of a chosen target speaker without any fine-tuning. Prevailing methods, however, encounter limitations at adapting to new speakers of out-of-domain settings, primarily due to inadequate speaker disentanglement and content leakage. To overcome these constraints, we propose an innovative negation feature learning paradigm that models decoupled speaker attributes as deviations from the complete audio representation by utilizing the subtraction operation. By eliminating superfluous content information from the speaker representation, our negation scheme not only mitigates content leakage, thereby enhancing synthesis robustness, but also improves speaker fidelity. In addition, to facilitate the learning of diverse speaker attributes, we leverage multi-stream Transformers, which retain multiple hypotheses and instigate a training paradigm akin to ensemble learning. To unify these hypotheses and realize the final speaker representation, we employ attention pooling. Finally, in light of the imperative to generate target text utterances in the desired voice, we adopt adaptive layer normalizations to effectively fuse the previously generated speaker representation with the target text representations, as opposed to mere concatenation of the text and audio modalities. Extensive experiments and validations substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach in preserving and harnessing speaker-specific attributes vis-`a-vis alternative baseline models.</description>

      <title>Masked Audio Generation using a Single Non-Autoregressive Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MAGNeT, a masked generative sequence modeling method that operates directly over several streams of audio tokens. Unlike prior work, MAGNeT is comprised of a single-stage, non-autoregressive transformer. During training, we predict spans of masked tokens obtained from a masking scheduler, while during inference we gradually construct the output sequence using several decoding steps. To further enhance the quality of the generated audio, we introduce a novel rescoring method in which, we leverage an external pre-trained model to rescore and rank predictions from MAGNeT, which will be then used for later decoding steps. Lastly, we explore a hybrid version of MAGNeT, in which we fuse between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models to generate the first few seconds in an autoregressive manner while the rest of the sequence is being decoded in parallel. We demonstrate the efficiency of MAGNeT for the task of text-to-music and text-to-audio generation and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering both objective metrics and human studies. The proposed approach is comparable to the evaluated baselines, while being significantly faster (x7 faster than the autoregressive baseline). Through ablation studies and analysis, we shed light on the importance of each of the components comprising MAGNeT, together with pointing to the trade-offs between autoregressive and non-autoregressive modeling, considering latency, throughput, and generation quality. Samples are available on our demo page https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/MAGNeT.</description>

      <title>Audio Flamingo: A Novel Audio Language Model with Few-Shot Learning and Dialogue Abilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) to understand audio -- including non-speech sounds and non-verbal speech -- is critically important for diverse real-world applications of LLMs. In this paper, we propose Audio Flamingo, a novel audio language model with 1) strong audio understanding abilities, 2) the ability to quickly adapt to unseen tasks via in-context learning and retrieval, and 3) strong multi-turn dialogue abilities. We introduce a series of training techniques, architecture design, and data strategies to enhance our model with these abilities. Extensive evaluations across various audio understanding tasks confirm the efficacy of our method, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks.
