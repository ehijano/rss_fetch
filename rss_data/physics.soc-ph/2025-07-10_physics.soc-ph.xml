      <title>Modeling Multistability and Hysteresis in Urban Traffic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the macroscopic functional states of urban road networks exhibit multistability and hysteresis, but microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that in real-world road networks, the recovery process of congested roads is not spontaneous, as assumed in existing models, but is hindered by connected congested roads, and such hindered recovery can lead to the emergence of multistability and hysteresis in urban traffic dynamics. By analyzing real-world urban traffic data, we observed that congestion propagation between individual roads is well described by a simple contagion process like an epidemic, but the recovery rate of a congested road decreases drastically by the congestion of the adjacent roads unlike an epidemic. Based on this microscopic observation, we proposed a simple model of congestion propagation and dissipation, and found that our model shows a discontinuous phase transition between macroscopic functional states of road networks when the recovery hindrance is strong enough through a mean-field approach and numerical simulations. Our findings shed light on an overlooked role of recovery processes in the collective dynamics of failures in networked systems.</description>

      <title>Peer influence breaks ergodicity in an opinion dynamics model with external information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stochastic imitation-based model of opinion dynamics in which agents balance social conformity with responsiveness to an external signal. The model captures how populations evolve between two binary opinion states, driven by peer influence and noisy external information. Through both memory-less and memory-based implementations, we identify a critical threshold of social sensitivity that separates an ergodic phase -- where agents collectively track the external signal -- from a non-ergodic phase characterized by persistent consensus and reduced adaptability to external changes. Analytical results and simulations reveal that memory in decision-making smooths the transition and lowers the critical threshold for ergodicity breaking. Extending the model to various network structures confirms the robustness of the observed phase transition. Our findings contribute to understanding how social conformity, memory effects and randomness jointly shape collective behaviour, with implications for predicting social tipping points and influencing large-scale social dynamics.</description>

      <title>Temporal Motif Participation Profiles for Analyzing Node Similarity in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks consisting of timestamped interactions between a set of nodes provide a useful representation for analyzing complex networked systems that evolve over time. Beyond pairwise interactions between nodes, temporal motifs capture patterns of higher-order interactions such as directed triangles over short time periods. We propose temporal motif participation profiles (TMPPs) to capture the behavior of nodes in temporal motifs. Two nodes with similar TMPPs take similar positions within temporal motifs, possibly with different nodes. TMPPs serve as unsupervised embeddings for nodes in temporal networks that are directly interpretable, as each entry denotes the frequency at which a node participates in a particular position in a specific temporal motif. We demonstrate that clustering TMPPs reveals groups of nodes with similar roles in a temporal network through simulation experiments and a case study on a network of militarized interstate disputes.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling of Oscillatory Dynamics in Circular Traffic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical model of traffic dynamics on a circular track, demonstrating the emergence of standing oscillations resulting from microscopic driver behaviour, delay responses, and proximity pressure. Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.</description>

      <title>Displacement and disconnection: the impact of violence on migration networks and highway traffic in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how violence affects migration flows and, crucially, how it reshapes the strength of migration networks -- measured by the intensity of migration between areas, accounting for the fact that some routes become more prominent or fade over time -- an aspect traditional studies overlook. Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</description>

      <title>IPSR Model: Misinformation Intervention through Prebunking in Social Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12740v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid dissemination of misinformation through online social networks poses a growing threat to public understanding and societal stability. Prebunking, a proactive strategy based on inoculation theory, has recently emerged as an effective intervention to build cognitive resilience against misinformation before exposure. In this work, we investigate the impact of prebunking on misinformation dynamics using a compartmental modeling framework. We first analyze the classical Ignorant-Spreader-Stifler (ISR) model, its parameters are determined using empirical rumor data from Twitter. We then propose an extended model, the Ignorant-Prebunked-Spreader-Stifler (IPSR) model, which incorporates prebunking as a preventive state and includes a forgetting mechanism to account for the decay of cognitive immunity over time. Using mean-field approximations, we derive steady-state solutions and examine the effect of prebunking on the spreading of misinformation. We further investigate the robustness of the IPSR model by varying network size and average degree. In addition, we analyze the model's behavior on Watts-Strogatz and Barabasi-Albert networks to assess the role of small-world and scale-free structures in shaping intervention outcomes. Our results show that the inclusion of prebunking significantly reduces the scale of misinformation outbreaks across different network structures. These findings highlight the efficacy of prebunking as a scalable intervention strategy and underscore the utility of compartmental models in understanding and mitigating information-based contagion in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Can Recombination Displace Dominant Scientific Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific breakthroughs are widely attributed to the broad recombination of existing knowledge. Yet despite the explosive growth of scientific labor and publications - expanding opportunities for recombination - breakthroughs have not kept pace. To investigate this disconnect, we analyze 41 million papers published between 1965 and 2024. We quantify each paper's atypicality, defined as the recombination of distant knowledge, and its disruption, which we interpret as an indicator of breakthrough innovation. Contrary to recombinant growth theory, we find a robust negative correlation between atypicality and disruption - consistent across fields, time, team size, and even versions of the same paper. Drawing on scientist interviews and large-scale bibliometric analysis, we find that atypicality reflects the extension of dominant ideas through cross-topic recombination, whereas disruption captures their replacement within the same topic - suggesting that recombination tends to consolidate prevailing paradigms, whereas disruption challenges them. Using large language models to distinguish method and theory oriented papers, we show that methods are harder to displace than theories, revealing distinct temporal dynamics in epistemic change.</description>
