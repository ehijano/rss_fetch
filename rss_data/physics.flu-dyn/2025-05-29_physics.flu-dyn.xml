      <title>Nonlinear Stability and Dynamics of Supersonic Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of shear layer instability in compressible flows is key to understanding phenomena from aerodynamics to astrophysical jets. Blumen's seminal paper [``Shear layer instability of an inviscid compressible fluid," J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 40}, 769--781 (1970)] established a linear stability framework for inviscid compressible shear flows, emphasizing velocity gradients and compressibility effects. However, the nonlinear regime remains insufficiently explored. This research extends Blumen's framework by conducting a weakly nonlinear stability analysis using the method of multiple scales to derive amplitude equations, such as the Landau-Stuart and complex Landau equations. Perturbation variables are expanded in a power series to capture amplitude evolution beyond linear theory. Finite boundary conditions are incorporated to enhance physical applicability. The study analyzes how compressibility and Mach number influence nonlinear saturation, revealing Mach-dependent bifurcations in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) with alternating stable and unstable regimes. Phase portraits and trajectories illustrate transitions, saturation, and spiral decay, which are relevant to astrophysical shear flows. Bifurcation analysis reveals both supercritical and subcritical Hopf behavior in compressible shear flows, underscoring the importance of nonlinear effects in the onset and evolution of flow instabilities. Qualitative and quantitative results of instability evolution have been shown from nonlinear stability analysis. This work bridges the critical gap between linear and fully nonlinear stability analyses by offering a systematic weakly nonlinear framework and the nonlinear dynamics for compressible shear layers. It generalizes the earlier linear results and provides new predictions about bifurcation behavior and long-time state selection in compressible flows.</description>

      <title>On the concentration distribution in turbulent thermals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent thermals emerge in a wide variety of geophysical and industrial flows, such as atmospheric cumulus convection and pollutant dispersal in oceans and lakes. They form when a volume of buoyant fluid, arising from thermal or compositional density differences, is instantly released from a source. As they rise or sink, heat and mass transfers are likely to occur with the surrounding environment, spanning multiple scales from macroscopic entrainment of ambient fluid to microscopic diffusive processes. Although turbulent thermals are typically investigated through their integral properties, mixing processes specifically depend on the internal distribution of concentration or temperature. Here, we use laboratory fluid dynamics experiments and direct numerical simulations to investigate the mixing of a passive scalar in turbulent thermals with large Reynolds numbers. We track the evolution of the concentration field, computing its moments and the probability density function. The concentration distribution exhibits self-similarity over time, except at high concentrations, possibly because of the presence of undiluted cores. These distributions are well approximated by an exponential probability density function. In the investigated range, we find that concentration distributions are largely independent of the P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>On the intracyclic instability in Stokes layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in both natural phenomena and industrial applications. Understanding the flow instabilities and transitions within these dynamical systems is essential for predicting and controlling their unsteady behaviour. A classic example of time-dependent flow is the Stokes layer. To study the transition mechanism in this flow, we employ the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to demonstrate that a linear energy amplification mechanism may explain the intracyclic instability in the transitional Stokes layer, supported by favourable comparisons with experimental measurements of axial turbulence intensity. This complements existing theories applied to the Stokes layer in the literature, including the Floquet analysis and the instantaneous/momentary analyses, which have struggled to capture this experimental observation accurately. The FTLE analysis is closely related to the transient growth analysis, formulated as an optimisation problem of the disturbance energy growth over time. We found that the energy amplification weakens as the finite Stokes layer becomes more confined and the oscillating frequency has a non-monotonic effect on the maximum transient growth. Based on these results, we recommend future experimental studies to validate this linear mechanism.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-induced freezing dynamics of droplets levitated in acoustic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the evaporation-induced freezing dynamics of pure cyclohexane droplets levitated via acoustic levitation. Acoustic levitation has attracted considerable attention across various fields owing to its potential to create lab-in-a-drop systems. While droplet evaporation is a fundamental physicochemical process in such a platform, the freezing of droplets induced by evaporation has been sparsely explored experimentally. For pure cyclohexane, the rapid evaporation of levitated droplets initiated freezing at the droplet surface. To better understand this evaporation-induced freezing process, the evaporation behavior of the levitated cyclohexane droplets was visualized and quantified using a high-speed camera and an infrared camera. According to the obtained experimental data, the evaporative heat transfer characteristics of the droplets were identified with theoretical models. Using the derived heat transfer coefficient, a mathematical prediction method for the onset of freezing was proposed and validated with the experimental data. These experimental findings offer valuable insights into the phase transition process and its potential physicochemical applications in a containerless environment.</description>

      <title>Effective flows across diffusio-phoretic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows enabled by phoretic mechanisms are of significant interest in several biological and biomedical processes, such as bacterial motion and targeted drug delivery. Here, we develop a homogenization-based macroscopic boundary condition which describes the effective flow across a diffusiophoretic microstructured membrane, where the interaction between the membrane walls and the solute particles is modeled via a potential-approach. We consider two cases where potential variations occur (i) at the pore scale and (ii) only in the close vicinity of the boundary, enabling a simplified version of the macroscopic flow description, in the latter case. Chemical interactions at the microscale are rigorously upscaled to macroscopic phoretic solvent velocity and solute flux contributions, and added to the classical permeability and diffusivity properties of the membrane. These properties stem from the solution of Stokes-advection-diffusion problems at the microscale, some of them forced by an interaction potential term. Eventually, we show an application of the macroscopic model to develop minimal phoretic pumps, showcasing its suitability for efficient design and optimization procedures.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Solid-Fluid Interaction Scheme in Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudopotential model within the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) framework has emerged as a prominent approach in computational fluid dynamics due to its dual strengths in physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, when modeling wettability phenomenon, existing solid-fluid interaction schemes exhibit persistent challenges in multi-component immiscible fluid systems, notably manifested through spurious velocity artifacts and unphysical mass-transfer boundary layers. This study presents an improved interaction scheme that preserves implementation simplicity while effectively mitigating these numerical artifacts. Furthermore, leveraging the enhanced isotropy characteristics of eighth-order discrete schemes, we develop a novel boundary treatment methodology addressing second-layer lattice data reconstruction at complex interfaces. To verify the universality of the proposed optimization scheme, four benchmark scenarios, including static contact angle measurement on cylindrical surface, droplet dynamics through confined geometries, immiscible displacement processes, and co-current flow in microchannels, are simulated to demonstrate the proposed scheme's capability. The results show that the improved scheme can well simulate various complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of thin film flows on a vertical fibre with vapor absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water vapor capture through free surface flows plays a crucial role in various industrial applications, such as liquid desiccant air conditioning systems, water harvesting, and dewatering. This paper studies the dynamics of a silicone liquid sorbent (also known as water-absorbing silicone oil) flowing down a vertical cylindrical fibre while absorbing water vapor. We propose a one-sided thin-film-type model for these dynamics, where the governing equations form a coupled system of nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equations for the liquid film thickness and oil concentration. The model incorporates gravity, surface tension, Marangoni effects induced by concentration gradients, and non-mass-conserving effects due to absorption flux. Interfacial instabilities, driven by the competition between mass-conserving and non-mass-conserving effects, are investigated via stability analysis. We numerically show that water absorption can lead to the formation of irregular wavy patterns and trigger droplet coalescence downstream. Systematic simulations further identify parameter ranges for the Marangoni number and absorption parameter that lead to the onset of droplet coalescence dynamics and regime transitions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid High-Order formulations with turbulence modelling capabilities for incompressible flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, that is well suited to be employed for the simulation of turbulent flows. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity and pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited when high-fidelity computations are required, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of mass enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the inviscid limit, implicit high-order accurate time stepping with local time step adaptation, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation of both velocity and pressure, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. After demonstrating the relevant properties of the scheme in practice, performing challenging 2D and 3D test cases, we consider the simulation of the Taylor--Green Vortex flow problem at Reynolds 1600.</description>

      <title>Reduced order modelling of air puff test for corneal material characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model for the air puff test were analysed. Using Abaqus, the air puff test is applied to eyes with varying biomechanical parameters, such as material properties, corneal thickness, and radius. A reduced order model of the air puff (a turbulent impinging jet) has been acquired to decrease simulation time from 48 hours for the FSI model to approximately 12 minutes for the finite element analysis (FEA) model alone. To further accelerate simulations and improve model accuracy, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) will be integrated with the reduced-order model. This hybrid approach will help expand the model to a larger dataset, enhancing intraocular pressure (IOP) estimation accuracy and the corneal material properties algorithm through inverse FEA. Additionally, a neural network (NN) framework with embedded Gaussian-modulated waveforms is proposed to model the pressure and deformation distributions on the corneal surface as functions of spatial and temporal parameters. By learning the relationship between corneal biomechanical inputs such as Corneal Central Thickness (CCT), Intraocular Pressure (IOP), and baseline properties (Mu), and the governing coefficients of pressure and deformation, the network accurately reconstructs the result that matches well with the high-fidelity CFD data. This approach can quickly capture the distribution of pressure and deformation. It can also provide insights into the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of pressure and deformation, giving a more comprehensive understanding of fluid-structure interaction phenomena in the air puff test.</description>

      <title>Turbulent separation control with a tilted wavy wall: a promising approach for energy savings in aerodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kami\'nski et al. [1] demonstrated that a two-dimensional streamwise waviness with carefully selected amplitude and period can be effectively used in postponement of a flow separation at high Reynolds number which is out of reach for other commonly known passive flow control strategies. This paper demonstrates that this approach can be substantially improved by introducing a novel type of surface waviness characterized by tilting the subsequent waves. The research is performed by applying the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method allowing for a detailed analysis of both instantaneous and time-averaged flow characteristics. It is shown that the tilting eliminates the occurrence of separation zones in waviness troughs, which minimizes the shape drag and maximizes the wall shear stress. In particular, compared to an optimal classical sinusoidal waviness shape the drag coefficient drops 14%. Simultaneously, 70% better performance in separation control is achieved. Moreover, it is also shown that when this issue is a priority, even further improvement can be achieved, though at the expense of greater drag.</description>

      <title>Modeling extreme events and intermittency in turbulent diffusion with a mean gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Fluid Simulation on Vortex Particle Flow Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Vortex Particle Flow Map (VPFM) method to simulate incompressible flow with complex vortical evolution in the presence of dynamic solid boundaries. The core insight of our approach is that vorticity is an ideal quantity for evolution on particle flow maps, enabling significantly longer flow map distances compared to other fluid quantities like velocity or impulse. To achieve this goal, we developed a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation that evolves vorticity and flow map quantities on vortex particles, while reconstructing velocity on a background grid. The method integrates three key components: (1) a vorticity-based particle flow map framework, (2) an accurate Hessian evolution scheme on particles, and (3) a solid boundary treatment for no-through and no-slip conditions in VPFM. These components collectively allow a substantially longer flow map length (3-12 times longer) than the state-of-the-art, enhancing vorticity preservation over extended spatiotemporal domains. We validated the performance of VPFM through diverse simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex vortex dynamics and turbulence phenomena.</description>

      <title>Godunov Loss Functions for Modelling of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>

Abstract: Machine learning techniques are being used as an alternative to traditional numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid flow. Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but can provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose the Godunov loss function: a loss based on the finite volume method (FVM) that crucially incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying and non-oscillatory manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach leads to superior performance compared to standard PINNs that use regularized PDE-based losses as well as FVM-based losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem in the context of time-stepping and super-resolution reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Linking emitted drops to collective bursting bubbles across a wide range of bubble size distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubbles entrained by breaking waves rise to the ocean surface, where they cluster before bursting and release droplets into the atmosphere. The ejected drops and dry aerosol particles, left behind after the liquid drop evaporates, affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere and can act as cloud condensation nuclei. The remaining uncertainties surrounding the sea spray emissions function motivate controlled laboratory experiments that directly measure and link collective bursting bubbles and the associated drops and sea salt aerosols. We perform experiments in artificial seawater for a wide range of bubble size distributions, measuring both bulk and surface bubble distributions (measured radii from 30 um to 5 mm), together with the associated drop size distribution (salt aerosols and drops of measured radii from 50 nm to 500 um) to quantify the link between emitted drops and bursting surface bubbles. We evaluate how well the individual bubble bursting scaling laws describe our data across all scales and demonstrate that the measured drop production by collective bubble bursting can be represented by a single framework integrating individual bubble bursting scaling laws over the various bubble sizes present in our experiments. We show that film drop production by bubbles between 100 um and 1 mm describes the submicron drop production, while jet drop production by bubbles from 30 um to 2 mm describes the production of drops larger than 1 um. Our work confirms that sea spray emissions functions based on individual bursting processes are reasonably accurate as long as the surface bursting bubble size distribution is known.</description>

      <title>Benjamin-Feir instability of wave packets at interface of liquid half-space and layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of internal waves in a hydrodynamic system comprising a solid bottom and an upper half-space is investigated. The study is conducted within the framework of a nonlinear low-dimensional model incorporating surface tension on an interface using the method of multi-scale expansions. The evolution equation of the envelope of the wave packet takes the form of the Schrodinger equation. Conditions for the Benjamin-Feir stability of the solution of the evolution equation are identified for various physical and geometrical characteristics of the system. An estimation of the parameter range in which the instability occurs is performed. Significant influence on the modulational stability of the geometrical characteristics of the system and surface tension is observed in each system for relatively small liquid layer thicknesses and waves with a wavelength comparable to the layer thickness</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>Droplets Suspended Beneath a Fiber Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet-fiber interactions, prevalent in nature and widely applied across various engineering fields, have garnered significant research interest. Many works have focused on the interactions between droplets and single or two fibers. However, the wetting behavior of droplets, especially the maximum droplets that can be retained, on fiber hubs formed by many fibers is rarely studied. The current work explores the capability of fiber hubs to retain liquid droplets. We develop analytical and semi-empirical models to predict the maximum droplet volume on a fiber hub, validating them against experimental data. The variation of maximum volume follows two distinct regimes as the fiber count increases, with a critical fiber number ($n^* = 32$) marking the transition between them. In Regime I ($n\le n^*$), the volume increases with fiber number, and the stability of a droplet is dictated by the pinning of three-phase contact lines. In Regime II ($n&gt;n^*$), the volume plateaus, with droplets under a fiber hub behaving similarly to those on a flat surface, where the stability is governed by Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>A stochastic force model for a finite-size spherical particle in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting particle-laden flows requires accurate fluid force models. However, a reliable particle force model for finite-size particles in turbulent flows remains lacking. In the present work, a fluid force model for a finite-size spherical particle in turbulence is developed by simulating turbulent flow past a fixed spherical particle using particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PRDNS). Our simulation demonstrates that turbulence increases the mean drag force of the particle, which is consistent with previous studies. By correlating the DNS data as functions of the Reynolds number of particles, the ratio of the particle-to-turbulence scale, and the intensity ratio of the turbulence, an empirical correlation for the mean drag force is obtained. Furthermore, we find that the fluctuations of both the drag and lateral forces follow the Gaussian distribution. Consequently, the temporal variations of the fluctuating drag and lateral forces are modeled using a stochastic Langevin equation. Empirical correlations of the fluctuation intensities and time scales involved in the stochastic model are also determined from the DNS data. Finally, we simulate the movement of a finite-size particle in turbulence and the dispersion of particles in a turbulent channel flow to validate the proposed model. The proposed fluid force model requires the mean flow velocity, the kinetic energy of the turbulence, and the dissipation rate of the turbulence as inputs, which makes it well suited for combination with the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach.</description>

      <title>Two apparently different interfacial stress formulations constructed from the diffuse interface free energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress in one-component fluids and the former represents the stress related to the osmotic pressure.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised neural-implicit laser absorption tomography for quantitative imaging of unsteady flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel neural-implicit approach to laser absorption tomography (LAT) with an experimental demonstration. A coordinate neural network is used to represent thermochemical state variables as continuous functions of space and time. Unlike most existing neural methods for LAT, which rely on prior simulations and supervised training, our approach is based solely on LAT measurements, utilizing a differentiable observation operator with line parameters provided in a standard spectroscopy database format. Although reconstructing scalar fields from multi-beam absorbance data is an inherently ill-posed, nonlinear inverse problem, our continuous space-time parameterization supports physics-inspired regularization strategies and enables data assimilation. Synthetic and experimental tests are conducted to validate the method, demonstrating robust performance and reproducibility. We show that our neural-implicit approach to LAT can capture the dominant spatial modes of an unsteady flame from very sparse measurement data, indicating its potential to reveal combustion instabilities in measurement domains with minimal optical access.</description>
