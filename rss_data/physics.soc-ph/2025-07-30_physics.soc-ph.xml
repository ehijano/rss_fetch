      <title>Strengthening Energy Access in Remote Off-Grid Contexts: From Deployment to Long-Term System Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized renewable energy (DRE) systems have become a cornerstone of electrification efforts in remote and underserved areas. Yet, while global attention has focused on expanding access through solar mini-grids and off-grid solutions, far less emphasis has been placed on ensuring the long-term operation of these systems. In many fragile contexts, weak Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) frameworks undermine the reliability and resilience of energy access, leading to premature system failure. This Perspective examines how structural and contextual barriers such as limited technical expertise, inadequate maintenance models, and insufficient local integration of energy systems contribute to this hidden challenge. We argue that O&amp;M should be reframed as a strategic function and embedded from the design phase onward. Building on insights from energy-scarce regions, we outline a pathway that combines user-friendly maintenance protocols, offline educational platforms, and community-based toolkits to support energy availability. This approach aims to empower local actors, support system functionality, and advance a sustainable energy transition.</description>

      <title>Counting Chemical Isomers with Multivariate Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting the number of isomers of a chemical molecule is one of the formative problems of graph theory. However, recent progress has been slow, and the problem has largely been ignored in modern network science. Here we provide an introduction to the mathematics of counting network structures and then use it to derive results for two new classes of molecules. In contrast to previously studied examples, these classes take additional chemical complexity into account and thus require the use of multi-variate generating functions. The results illustrate the elegance of counting theory, highlighting it as an important tool that should receive more attention in network science.</description>

      <title>Impacts of photocatalytic hydrogen production on the European energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Especially in regions with high solar irradiation, photocatalysis presents a promising low-cost "green" hydrogen production option. Thus, this paper analyzes impacts of increasing photocatalysis shares on the European energy system using an open-source energy system optimization model covering the electricity, industry, and heating sectors with high spatial and temporal resolution. Photocatalysis deployment is investigated at various market shares by exogenously altering photocatalysis costs. The results show that integrating photocatalysis necessitates systematic adjustments since it lacks the flexible load attributes of water electrolysis. Therefore, a significant geographic shift in hydrogen production and demand from the Northwest to South Europe is expected in the case of large-scale photocatalysis adoption. Despite these challenges, installed photocatalysis shows costs within the photocatalysis cost projections. Thus, photocatalysis could contribute to a critical diversification of hydrogen production, easing material demands for other renewable technologies. Nevertheless, it requires strategic planning to avoid lock-ins and to maximize its potential.</description>

      <title>Inter-city infections and the role of size heterogeneity in containment strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of regional lockdown strategies in mitigating pathogen spread across regional units, termed cities hereinafter. We develop simplified models to analyze infection spread across cities within a country during an epidemic wave. Isolation of a city is initiated when infection numbers within the city surpass defined thresholds. We compare two strategies: strategy (P) consists in prescribing thresholds proportionally to city sizes, while the same threshold is used for all cities under strategy (U). Given the heavy-tailed distribution of city sizes, strategy (P) may result in more secondary infections from larger cities than strategy (U).
  Random graph models are constructed to represent infection spread as a percolation process. In particular, we consider a model in which mobility between cities only depends on city sizes. We assess the relative efficiency of the two strategies by comparing the ratios of the number of individuals under isolation to the total number of infections by the end of the epidemic wave under strategy (P) and (U). Additionally, we derive analytical formulas for disease prevalence and basic reproduction numbers.
  Our models are calibrated using mobility data from France, Poland and Japan, validated through simulation. The findings indicate that mobility between cities in France and Poland is mainly determined by city sizes. However, a poor fit was observed with Japanese data, highlighting the importance to include other factors like e.g. geography for some countries in modeling. Our analysis suggest similar effectiveness for both strategies in France and Japan, while strategy (U) demonstrates distinct merits in Poland.</description>

      <title>A Computational Analysis of Traffic Cluster Dynamics Using a Percolation-Based Approach in Urban Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of traffic clusters is crucial for enhancing urban transportation systems, particularly in managing congestion and free-flow states. This study applies computational percolation theory to analyze the formation and growth of traffic clusters within urban road networks, using high-resolution taxi data from Chengdu, China. Presenting the road network as a time-dependent, weighted, directed graph, we identify distinct behaviors in traffic jam and free-flow clusters through the growth patterns of giant connected components (GCCs). A persistent gap between GCC size curves, especially during rush hours, highlights disparities driven by spatial traffic correlations. These are quantified through long-range weight-weight correlations, offering a novel computational metric for traffic dynamics. Our approach demonstrates the influence of network topology and temporal variations on cluster formation, providing a robust framework for modeling complex traffic systems. The findings have practical implications for traffic management, including dynamic signal optimization, infrastructure prioritization, and strategies to mitigate congestion. By integrating graph theory, percolation analysis, and traffic modeling, this study advances computational methods in urban traffic analysis and offers a foundation for optimizing large-scale transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Green building blocks reveal the complex anatomy of climate change mitigation technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving net-zero emissions requires rapid innovation, yet the necessary technological knowhow is scattered across industries and countries. Comparing functionally similar green and nongreen patents, we identify "Green Building Blocks" (GBBs): modular components that can be added to reduce existing technologies' carbon footprints. These GBBs depict the anatomy of the green transition as a network that connects problems -- nongreen technologies -- to GBBs that mitigate their climate-change impact. Node degrees in this network are highly unequal, showing that the scope for climate-change mitigating innovation varies substantially across domains. The network also helps predict which green technologies firms develop themselves, and which alliances they form to do so. This reveals a critical dependence on international collaboration: optimal innovation partners for 84% of US, 87% of German, and 92% of Chinese firms are foreign, providing quantitative evidence that rising economic nationalism threatens the pace of innovation required to meet global climate goals.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of coupled sociopolitical events-planetary boundaries, crises, policrisis and Earth System syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of the human activities can be evaluated by the Planetary Boundaries (PBs), however, so far it is not clear how to assess the influence of specific sociopolitical events (SPEs) on the Earth System (ES) and at the same measure, without a suitable framework, to gauge how these affect the PBs. In this work, we propose an interacting matrix model that couples SPEs with the PBs and consider the possible evolution scenarios and, in particular, those leading to crises and policrisis. We address specifically the situation where the PBs evolve according to the continuous logistic function, and then consider an exponentially-evolving SPE, which we show to cause a runaway effect on the PBs. We also propose a way to describe, classify, and compare sociopolitical syndromes, that is, a set composed of more than a single polycrisis.</description>
