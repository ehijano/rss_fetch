      <title>Set-based queries for multiscale shape-material modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale structures are becoming increasingly prevalent in the field of mechanical design. The variety of fine-scale structures and their respective representations results in an interoperability challenge. To address this, a query-based API was recently proposed which allows different representations to be combined across the scales for multiscale structures modeling. The query-based approach is fully parallelizable and has a low memory footprint; however, this architecture requires repeated evaluation of the fine-scale structures locally for each individual query. While this overhead is manageable for simpler fine-scale structures such as parametric lattice structures, it is problematic for structures requiring non-trivial computations, such as Voronoi foam structures.
  In this paper, we develop a set-based query that retains the compatibility and usability of the point-based query while leveraging locality between multiple point-based queries to provide a significant speedup and further decrease the memory consumption for common applications, including visualization and slicing for manufacturing planning. We first define the general set-based query that consolidates multiple point-based queries at arbitrary locations. We then implement specialized preprocessing methods for different types of fine-scale structures which are otherwise inefficient with the point-based query. Finally, we apply the set-based query to downstream applications such as ray-casting and slicing, increasing their performance by an order of magnitude. The overall improvements result in the generation and rendering of complex fine-scale structures such as Voronoi foams at interactive frame rates on the CPU.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Manufacturing Feature Recognition in CAD Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic feature recognition (AFR) is essential for transforming design knowledge into actionable manufacturing information. Traditional AFR methods, which rely on predefined geometric rules and large datasets, are often time-consuming and lack generalizability across various manufacturing features. To address these challenges, this study investigates vision-language models (VLMs) for automating the recognition of a wide range of manufacturing features in CAD designs without the need for extensive training datasets or predefined rules. Instead, prompt engineering techniques, such as multi-view query images, few-shot learning, sequential reasoning, and chain-of-thought, are applied to enable recognition. The approach is evaluated on a newly developed CAD dataset containing designs of varying complexity relevant to machining, additive manufacturing, sheet metal forming, molding, and casting. Five VLMs, including three closed-source models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Claude-3.0-Opus) and two open-source models (LLava and MiniCPM), are evaluated on this dataset with ground truth features labelled by experts. Key metrics include feature quantity accuracy, feature name matching accuracy, hallucination rate, and mean absolute error (MAE). Results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieves the highest feature quantity accuracy (74%) and name-matching accuracy (75%) with the lowest MAE (3.2), while GPT-4o records the lowest hallucination rate (8%). In contrast, open-source models have higher hallucination rates (&gt;30%) and lower accuracies (&lt;40%). This study demonstrates the potential of VLMs to automate feature recognition in CAD designs within diverse manufacturing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Models for Active Skeletal Muscle: Review, Comparison, and Application in a Novel Continuum Shoulder Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shoulder joint is one of the functionally and anatomically most sophisticated articular systems in the human body. Both complex movement patterns and the stabilization of the highly mobile joint rely on intricate three-dimensional interactions among various components. Continuum-based finite element models can capture such complexity, and are thus particularly relevant in shoulder biomechanics. Considering their role as active joint stabilizers and force generators, skeletal muscles require special attention regarding their constitutive description. In this contribution, we propose a constitutive description to model active skeletal muscle within complex musculoskeletal systems, focusing on a novel continuum shoulder model. We thoroughly review existing material models before analyzing three selected ones in detail: an active-stress, an active-strain, and a generalized active-strain approach. To establish a basis for comparison, we identify the material parameters based on experimental stress-strain data obtained under various active and passive loading conditions. We discuss the concepts to incorporate active contractile behavior from a mathematical and physiological perspective, address analytical and numerical challenges arising from the mathematical formulations, and analyze the included biophysical principles of force generation in terms of physiological correctness and relevance for human shoulder modeling. Based on these insights, we present an improved constitutive model combining the studied models' most promising and relevant features. Using the example of a fusiform muscle, we investigate force generation, deformation, and kinematics during active isometric and free contractions. Eventually, we demonstrate the applicability of the suggested material model in a novel continuum mechanical model of the human shoulder.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-Fidelity Aeroelastic Tailoring: Prospect and Model Assessment</title>

Abstract: The design and optimisation of aircraft wings are critical tasks in aerospace engineering, requiring a balance between structural integrity, aerostructural performance, and manufacturability. This multifaceted challenge involves the interplay of various disciplines, each with distinct parameters and constraints. Traditional design approaches often fall short, necessitating advanced methodologies like Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO). MDO integrates aerodynamic, structural, and manufacturability analyses to explore a vast design space and identify optimal solutions that meet performance, safety, and cost criteria. The work highlights the challenge of optimising aircraft designs using multiple models of varying fidelity. Traditional sequential optimisation approaches, which progressively integrate disciplines, may miss potential superior designs due to limited initial information. Instead, concurrent optimisation schemes are explored, utilising both low-fidelity (beam-based) and high-fidelity (shell-based) models. This approach promises structural feasibility, reduces computational costs, and incorporates high-fidelity information early in the design process. The envisioned methodology bridges different design stages, enabling better overall aircraft performance. By aligning and comparing a beam-based and shell-based model, the study explores their use in multi-fidelity optimisation. The results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of this approach, offering a robust framework for future aircraft design projects.</description>

      <title>IdeaBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Research Idea Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed how people interact with artificial intelligence (AI) systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in various tasks, including scientific discovery and hypothesis generation. However, the lack of a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework for generating research ideas using LLMs poses a significant obstacle to understanding and assessing their generative capabilities in scientific discovery. To address this gap, we propose IdeaBench, a benchmark system that includes a comprehensive dataset and an evaluation framework for standardizing the assessment of research idea generation using LLMs. Our dataset comprises titles and abstracts from a diverse range of influential papers, along with their referenced works. To emulate the human process of generating research ideas, we profile LLMs as domain-specific researchers and ground them in the same context considered by human researchers. This maximizes the utilization of the LLMs' parametric knowledge to dynamically generate new research ideas. We also introduce an evaluation framework for assessing the quality of generated research ideas. Our evaluation framework is a two-stage process: first, using GPT-4o to rank ideas based on user-specified quality indicators such as novelty and feasibility, enabling scalable personalization; and second, calculating relative ranking based "Insight Score" to quantify the chosen quality indicator. The proposed benchmark system will be a valuable asset for the community to measure and compare different LLMs, ultimately advancing the automation of the scientific discovery process.</description>

      <title>JPEC: A Novel Graph Neural Network for Competitor Retrieval in Financial Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs have gained popularity for their ability to organize and analyze complex data effectively. When combined with graph embedding techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), knowledge graphs become a potent tool in providing valuable insights. This study explores the application of graph embedding in identifying competitors from a financial knowledge graph. Existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) models face challenges due to the unique attributes of our knowledge graph, including directed and undirected relationships, attributed nodes, and minimal annotated competitor connections. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph embedding model, JPEC(JPMorgan Proximity Embedding for Competitor Detection), which utilizes graph neural network to learn from both first-order and second-order node proximity together with vital features for competitor retrieval. JPEC had outperformed most existing models in extensive experiments, showcasing its effectiveness in competitor retrieval.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamic Network Model of the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes to model the space environment as a stochastic dynamic network where each node is a group of objects of a given class, or species, and their relationship is represented by stochastic links. A set of stochastic dynamic equations, governing the evolution of the network, are derived from the network structure and topology. It will be shown that the proposed system of stochastic dynamic equations well reproduces existing results on the evolution of the space environment. The analysis of the structure of the network and relationships among node can help to understand which species of objects and orbit regimes are more critical and affect the most the future evolution of the space environment. In analogy with ecological networks, we develop a theory of the carrying capacity of space based on the stability of equilibria of the network dynamics. Some examples are presented starting from the current population of resident objects and different launch traffic forecast models. It will be shown how the proposed network model can be used to study the effect of the adoption of different policies on the execution of collision avoidance and post mission disposal manoeuvres.</description>

      <title>Convolution finite element based digital image correlation for displacement and strain measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel global digital image correlation (DIC) method, based on a newly developed convolution finite element (C-FE) approximation. The convolution approximation can rely on the mesh of linear finite elements and enables arbitrarily high order approximations without adding more degrees of freedom. Therefore, the C-FE based DIC can be more accurate than {the} usual FE based DIC by providing highly smooth and accurate displacement and strain results with the same element size. The detailed formulation and implementation of the method have been discussed in this work. The controlling parameters in the method include the polynomial order, patch size, and dilation. A general choice of the parameters and their potential adaptivity have been discussed. The proposed DIC method has been tested by several representative examples, including the DIC challenge 2.0 benchmark problems, with comparison to the usual FE based DIC. C-FE outperformed FE in all the DIC results for the tested examples. This work demonstrates the potential of C-FE and opens a new avenue to enable highly smooth, accurate, and robust DIC analysis for full-field displacement and strain measurements.</description>
