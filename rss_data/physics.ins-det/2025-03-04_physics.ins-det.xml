      <title>ALICE Event Display -- from the legacy ROOT-based visualization to the web-based application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is one of the four big CERN experiments at the LHC. The area of interest is the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma which is produced in heavy-ion collisions. The trajectories of particles created in collisions are reconstructed online and are visualized together with the detector geometry to provide proper augmentation of the presented data. This interactive visualization tool allows 3D visualization of samples taken from the collected data. Starting with LHC Run 3 (from 2022), a newly developed solution has been adopted following the creation of the new ALICE O\textsuperscript{2} Framework. In the first step the data handling part was implemented. The visualization part was developed using technologies from LHC Run 2. This paper presents the process of transition of the visualization component to the modern web based solution. The architecture of the existing ALICE LHC Run 3 online real-time visualization solution is presented. The advantages of the new approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Development of High-Sensitivity Radon Emanation Measurement Systems with Surface Treatment Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radon and its progenies are significant sources of background in rare event detection experiments, including dark matter searches like the PandaX-4T experiment and other rare decay studies such as neutrinoless double beta decay (NLDBD). In order to measure and control radon emanation for these experiments, we have developed two specialized radon measurement systems: a radon emanation measurement system suitable for small-sized samples with a blank rate of $0.03 \pm 0.01$ mBq in the 12.3 L counting chamber, and a radon trap system designed for large-volume samples using low-temperature radon trapping techniques, which improves the sensitivity by a factor of 30 with 1 standard liter per minute (slpm) gas flow and 6 hours trapping time. To boost the detection sensitivity, various surface treatments of the chambers were investigated, including mechanical polishing, electrochemical polishing, and mirror polishing, which reveals that smoother surfaces lead to lower radon emanation rates. In addition, treatments such as applying epoxy coating and covering with aluminized Mylar to stainless steel chambers can also reduce the radon emanation by ($90 \pm 7)\%$ and ($60 \pm 12)\%$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Background from $^{13}$C$(\alpha, n)^{16}$O Reaction in the JUNO Scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale organic liquid scintillator detectors are highly efficient in the detection of MeV-scale electron antineutrinos. These signal events can be detected through inverse beta decay on protons, which produce a positron accompanied by a neutron. A noteworthy background for antineutrinos coming from nuclear power reactors and from the depths of the Earth (geoneutrinos) is generated by ($\alpha, n$) reactions. In organic liquid scintillator detectors, $\alpha$ particles emitted from intrinsic contaminants such as $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th, and $^{210}$Pb/$^{210}$Po, can be captured on $^{13}$C nuclei, followed by the emission of a MeV-scale neutron. Three distinct interaction mechanisms can produce prompt energy depositions preceding the delayed neutron capture, leading to a pair of events correlated in space and time within the detector. Thus, ($\alpha, n$) reactions represent an indistinguishable background in liquid scintillator-based antineutrino detectors, where their expected rate and energy spectrum are typically evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. This work presents results from the open-source SaG4n software, used to calculate the expected energy depositions from the neutron and any associated de-excitation products. Also simulated is a detailed detector response to these interactions, using a dedicated Geant4-based simulation software from the JUNO experiment. An expected measurable $^{13}$C$(\alpha, n)^{16}$O event rate and reconstructed prompt energy spectrum with associated uncertainties, are presented in the context of JUNO, however, the methods and results are applicable and relevant to other organic liquid scintillator neutrino detectors.</description>

      <title>Towards AMS measurements of $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo produced in fusion environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived radionuclides, such as $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo, are expected to be produced in nuclear fusion reactors by reactions of high-energy neutrons with the structural material. Accurate predictions of waste categorization require experimental validation of simulation codes like FISPACT-II. This work explores the use of Ion-Laser InterAction Mass Spectrometry (ILIAMS) at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) to measure these three radionuclides by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The ILIAMS setup employs laser photodetachment to suppress their respective stable isobars: $^{91}$Zr, $^{94}$Zr and $^{94}$Mo, and $^{93}$Nb.
  For $^{91,94}$Nb measurements, the NbO$_3^-$ anion is selected, with interferences from $^{91,94}$ZrO$_{3}^-$ already suppressed just by collisions with the He buffer gas in the ion cooler. The suppression can be further enhanced by overlapping a 355$\,$nm laser with the ion beam. In that way, we reach $^{91}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb and $^{94}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb levels of $1.2\,\times\,10^{-14}$ and $1.8\,\times\,10^{-14}$, respectively, in commercial Nb$_2$O$_5$ targets. The MoO$_3^-$ anion was suppressed by a factor of 4360, leading to a $^{94}$Mo/$^{93}$Nb interference of $1.28\,\times\,10^{-10}$ in the same targets.
  For $^{93}$Mo measurements, the MoO$_2^-$ anion is selected, with interference from $^{93}$NbO$_2^-$ suppressed by 637$\,$nm photons by a factor of $5.5\,\times\,10^6$. This results in a $^{93}$Nb/$^\text{nat}$Mo level of $1.3\,\times\,10^{-13}$ in targets prepared from commercial MoO$_3$.
  These suppressions are not achieved using separation techniques based on the difference in energy loss, even in AMS facilities with terminal voltages above 8.5$\,$MV and foil stripping.</description>

      <title>Annealing behaviour of charge collection of neutron irradiated diodes from 8-inch p-type silicon wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The electromagnetic section as well as the high-radiation regions of the hadronic section of the CE (fluences above $\rm1.0\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$) will be equipped with silicon pad sensors, covering a total area of 620 $\rm m^2$. Fluences up to $\rm1.0\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses up to 2 MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of 3 $\rm ab^{-1}$. The whole CE will normally operate at -35{\deg}C in order to mitigate the effects of radiation damage.
  The silicon sensors are processed on novel 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300 $\mu m$, 200 $\mu m$ and 120 $\mu m$ and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor several small sized test structures (e.g pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with neutrons at JSI (Jo\v{z}ef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana) to fluences between $\rm6.5\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $\rm1.5\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$.
  The charge collection of the irradiated silicon diodes is determined through transient current technique (TCT) measurements. The study focuses on the isothermal annealing behaviour of the bulk material at 60{\deg}C. The results have been used to optimize the layout of the silicon modules in HGCAL and are being used to estimate the expected annealing effects of the silicon sensors during year-end technical stops and long HL-LHC shutdowns currently foreseen with a temperature around 0{\deg}C.</description>

      <title>DataPix4: A C++ framework for Timepix4 configuration and read-out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DataPix4 (Data Acquisition for Timepix4 Applications) is a new C++ framework for the management of Timepix4 ASIC, a multi-purpose hybrid pixel detector designed at CERN. Timepix4 consists of a matrix of 448x512 pixels that can be connected to several types of sensors, to obtain a pixelated detector suitable for different applications. DataPix4 can be used both for the full configuration of Timepix4 and its control board, and for the data read-out via slow control or fast links. Furthermore, it has a flexible architecture that allows for changes in the hardware, making it easy to adjust the framework to custom setups and exploit all classes with minimal modification.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pre-train the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set, and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode (FCC-ee). We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics; including jet resolution and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large physics models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping accelerate the development cycle for new detectors, and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Design of a quantum diamond microscope with efficient scanning confocal readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the light-sheet confocal quantum diamond microscope (LC-QDM) for widefield 3D quantum sensing with efficient confocal readout. The LC-QDM leverages light-sheet illumination and laser scanning confocal methods to enable high-resolution, high-speed 3D measurements with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond, combining the best of widefield and confocal modalities in a single device and eliminating the need for thin-NV-layer diamond chips. We perform simulations and measurements of NV initialization and readout times to model the anticipated performance of the LC-QDM compared to existing QDM designs. Our findings show that the LC-QDM will provide significant advantages for applications requiring limited laser power.</description>

      <title>Performance and radiation damage mitigation strategy for silicon photomultipliers on LEO space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00532v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space missions require lightweight, low-power consuming, radiation-tolerant components. Silicon photomultipliers are increasingly used for detecting near-UV, optical, and infrared light in space due to their compact design, low cost, low power consumption, robustness, and high photo-detection efficiency, which makes them sensitive to single photons. Although SiPMs outperform traditional photomultiplier tubes in many areas, concerns about their radiation tolerance and noise remain. In this study, we estimate the radiation effects on a satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550~km during the declining phase of solar cycle 25 (2026-2029). We evaluated silicon photomultipliers produced by the Foundation Bruno Kessler (FBK) using front-side illuminated technology with metal trenches (NUV-HD-MT), assessing their response to a 50~MeV proton beam and exposure to a $\beta$-radioactive source (strontium-90). Simulations with SPENVIS and Geant4 were used to validate the experimental results. Based on our findings, we propose a photosensor annealing strategy for space-based instruments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fiber-Based Radio Frequency Distribution and Vibration Detection System Tailored for Large Radio Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio telescope arrays, such as Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), require highly precise synchronization of time-frequency references to ensure high-quality observational data. Fiber-based frequency distribution systems are highly effective. However, their proper functioning can be threatened by risk events. In this paper, we propose a hybrid fiber-based frequency-distribution and vibration detection system tailored for large radio arrays. The system ensures the performance of distributed frequency signals while allowing for the monitoring of potential threats to the optical fiber network. We design and implement a single-to-multiple hybrid system, conducting tests via a 55-km fiber link. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving the relative frequency stability of 3E-14/1 s and 2.7E-17/1E5 s, along with vibration detection and localization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical cavity design that bypasses mode mixings in axion haloscope experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.</description>

      <title>Compact Cosmic Muon Tracker using Resistive Plate Chambers for Public Science Outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primary cosmic rays when interact with our atmosphere, produce a cascade of lighter secondary particles namely pion, kaon, neutrons, muons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. Muons are one of the most abundant and easily detectable particles at the ground surface using a large variety of particle detectors. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of 2 m x 2 m in dimension were developed to be used in large scale as the active detector elements in the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) which was planned to be built by the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). As a spin-off of this work, a portable stack of eight, one square foot RPC detectors is developed. While the main purpose of this Cosmic Muon Tracker (CMT) detector is training of students, outreach and science popularisation, it could also be used to conduct small-scale particle detector experiments. We will discuss design, integration, characterisation and some of the applications of this detector in this paper.</description>

      <title>Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models, and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Non-magnetic glass-fiber cryostat for MADMAX prototype tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MADMAX, an axion dark matter search experiment, is currently in the prototype testing phase. Its working principle is based on the conversion of axions in a magnetic field into photons. This signal is then enhanced by a booster made of dielectric disks placed in front of a mirror. In order to test MADMAX prototypes at cryogenic temperatures in a magnetic field parallel to the disks, a new G-10 glass-fiber cryostat of 0.06 m$^3$ inner volume was designed, tested and used in a CERN magnet. The design allows to minimise cost as well as cooling down and warming up times. Using continuous circulation flow of gaseous helium, the MADMAX prototype was cooled down reproducibly to temperatures below 10 K for more than 24 hours. This procedure allowed, for the first time, to perform a calibration of the booster response and to run a dark matter axion search in a magnetic field at low temperatures. This novel type of cryostat, with a low manufacturing cost, fast and easy to operate, could be used for other purposes beyond MADMAX.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Detector Optimization with Diffusion models: A Case Study in Sampling Calorimeters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have opened new avenues for optimizing detector designs in high-energy physics, where the complex interplay of geometry, materials, and physics processes has traditionally posed a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce the $\textit{end-to-end}$ AI Detector Optimization framework (AIDO) that leverages a diffusion model as a surrogate for the full simulation and reconstruction chain, enabling gradient-based design exploration in both continuous and discrete parameter spaces. Although this framework is applicable to a broad range of detectors, we illustrate its power using the specific example of a sampling calorimeter, focusing on charged pions and photons as representative incident particles. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively captures critical performance metrics for calorimeter design, guiding the automatic search for layer arrangement and material composition that aligns with known calorimeter principles. The success of this proof-of-concept study provides a foundation for future applications of end-to-end optimization to more complex detector systems, offering a promising path toward systematically exploring the vast design space in next-generation experiments.</description>

Abstract: A detector concept, named IDEA, optimized for the physics and running conditions at the FCC-ee is presented. After discussing the expected running conditions and the main physics drivers, a detailed description of the individual sub-detectors is given. These include: a very light tracking system with a powerful vertex detector inside a large drift chamber surrounded by a silicon wrapper, a high resolution dual readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, an HTS based superconducting solenoid, a dual readout fiber calorimeter and three layers of muon chambers embedded in the magnet flux return yoke.

      <title>Table-top three-dimensional photoemission orbital tomography with a femtosecond extreme ultraviolet light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</description>
