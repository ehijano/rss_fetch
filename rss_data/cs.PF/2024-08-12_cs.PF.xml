      <title>Columbo: Low Level End-to-End System Traces through Modular Full-System Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully understanding performance is a growing challenge when building next-generation cloud systems. Often these systems build on next-generation hardware, and evaluation in realistic physical testbeds is out of reach.   Even when physical testbeds are available, visibility into essential system aspects is a challenge in modern systems where system performance depends on often sub-$\mu s$ interactions between HW and SW components. Existing tools such as performance counters, logging, and distributed tracing provide aggregate or sampled information, but remain insufficient for understanding individual requests in-depth. In this paper, we explore a fundamentally different approach to enable in-depth understanding of cloud system behavior at the software and hardware level, with (almost) arbitrarily fine-grained visibility. Our proposal is to run cloud systems in detailed full-system simulations, configure the simulators to collect detailed events without affecting the system, and finally assemble these events into end-to-end system traces that can be analyzed by existing distributed tracing tools.</description>

      <title>Solving Large Rank-Deficient Linear Least-Squares Problems on Shared-Memory CPU Architectures and GPU Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving very large linear systems of equations is a key computational task in science and technology. In many cases, the coefficient matrix of the linear system is rank-deficient, leading to systems that may be underdetermined, inconsistent, or both. In such cases, one generally seeks to compute the least squares solution that minimizes the residual of the problem, which can be further defined as the solution with smallest norm in cases where the coefficient matrix has a nontrivial nullspace. This work presents several new techniques for solving least squares problems involving coefficient matrices that are so large that they do not fit in main memory. The implementations include both CPU and GPU variants. All techniques rely on complete orthogonal decompositions that guarantee that both conditions of a least squares solution are met, regardless of the rank properties of the matrix. Specifically, they rely on the recently proposed "randUTV" algorithm that is particularly effective in strongly communication-constrained environments. A detailed precision and performance study reveals that the new methods, that operate on data stored on disk, are competitive with state-of-the-art methods that store all data in main memory.</description>
