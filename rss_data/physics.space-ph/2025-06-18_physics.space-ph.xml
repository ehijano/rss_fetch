      <title>A Study on Effective Initial Guess Finding Method Based on B\'ezier Curves: Orbit Determination Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In celestial mechanics, proper orbits related to missions are obtained by solving two-point boundary value problems. Since a selection method of initial value affects the convergence of the solution, developing an effective method to find an initial guess is required. In this work, B\'ezier curves, which can describe complicated curves and surfaces, are utilized to find the initial guess. First, the given problems are transformed into B\'ezier curves forms, and B\'ezier curves' control points, which can handle the shape of curves, are selected by solving the system of nonlinear equations. Finally, the initial guess is obtained by substituting the calculated control points to B\'ezier curves. To validate the performance of the proposed method, numerical simulations are conducted with respect to three kinds of orbits, which are from circular to highly elliptical orbit (HEO). The proposed method is compared to the general shooting method. The comparison results show that the initial guess calculated by B\'ezier curves makes finding the solution more efficient in terms of computational time and iterations. Also, it shows that the proposed method finds the solution for the HEO while the general shooting method fails to find the solution.</description>

      <title>Prospecting for lunar Helium-3 with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mining $^3{\rm He}$ from lunar regolith has attracted significant interest in recent years due to the scarcity of $^3{\rm He}$ on Earth and its diverse applications, from cryogenics and medical imaging, to nuclear physics and future nuclear fusion. Given the stringent technical and economic challenges of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$, precise prospecting is essential. Here we propose a prospecting methodology based on a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer, which can detect the dipolar magnetic field of thermally polarized $^3{\rm He}$ spins. With a 200 g regolith sample and an rf-magnetometer with sensitivity $1~{\rm fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ we can detect $^3{\rm He}$ with abundance 5 ppb within a measurement time of just 5 min. The associated apparatus is lightweight and significantly more cost-effective than alternative measurement techniques. The proposed prospecting method is readily deployable and could substantially improve the technical and economic feasibility of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$.</description>
