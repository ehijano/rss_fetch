      <title>A New Reduction Method from Multivariate Polynomials to Univariate Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial multiplication is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation. There are efficient methods for the multiplication of two univariate polynomials. However, there is rarely efficiently nontrivial method for the multiplication of two multivariate polynomials. Therefore, we consider a new multiplication mechanism that involves a) reversibly reducing multivariate polynomials into univariate polynomials, b) calculating the product of the derived univariate polynomials by the Toom-Cook or FFT algorithm, and c) correctly recovering the product of multivariate polynomials from the product of two univariate polynomials. This work focuses on step a), expecting the degrees of the derived univariate polynomials to be as small as possible. We propose iterative Kronecker substitution, where smaller substitution exponents are selected instead of standard Kronecker substitution. We also apply the Chinese remainder theorem to polynomial reduction and find its advantages in some cases. Afterwards, we provide a hybrid reduction combining the advantages of both reduction methods. Moreover, we compare these reduction methods in terms of lower and upper bounds of the degree of the product of two derived univariate polynomials, and their computational complexities. With randomly generated multivariate polynomials, experiments show that the degree of the product of two univariate polynomials derived from the hybrid reduction can be reduced even to approximately 3% that resulting from the standard Kronecker substitution, implying an efficient subsequent multiplication of two univariate polynomials.</description>

      <title>Private graphon estimation via sum-of-squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the first pure node-differentially-private algorithms for learning stochastic block models and for graphon estimation with polynomial running time for any constant number of blocks. The statistical utility guarantees match those of the previous best information-theoretic (exponential-time) node-private mechanisms for these problems. The algorithm is based on an exponential mechanism for a score function defined in terms of a sum-of-squares relaxation whose level depends on the number of blocks. The key ingredients of our results are (1) a characterization of the distance between the block graphons in terms of a quadratic optimization over the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices, (2) a general sum-of-squares convergence result for polynomial optimization over arbitrary polytopes, and (3) a general approach to perform Lipschitz extensions of score functions as part of the sum-of-squares algorithmic paradigm.</description>

      <title>Some properties of Higman-Thompson monoids and digital circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define various monoid versions of the R. Thompson group $V$, and prove connections with monoids of acyclic digital circuits. We show that the monoid $M_{2,1}$ (based on partial functions) is not embeddable into Thompson's monoid ${\sf tot}M_{2,1}$, but that ${\sf tot}M_{2,1}$ has a submonoid that maps homomorphically onto $M_{2,1}$. This leads to an efficient completion algorithm for partial functions and partial circuits. We show that the union of partial circuits with disjoint domains is an element of $M_{2,1}$, and conversely, every element of $M_{2,1}$ can be decomposed efficiently into a union of partial circuits with disjoint domains.</description>

      <title>On the impossibility of discovering a formula for primes using AI</title>

Abstract: The present work explores the theoretical limits of Machine Learning (ML) within the framework of Kolmogorov's theory of Algorithmic Probability, which clarifies the notion of entropy as Expected Kolmogorov Complexity and formalizes other fundamental concepts such as Occam's razor via Levin's Universal Distribution. As a fundamental application, we develop Maximum Entropy methods that allow us to derive the Erd\H{o}s-Kac Law and Hardy-Ramanujan theorem in Probabilistic Number Theory, and establish the impossibility of discovering a formula for primes using Machine Learning via the Prime Coding Theorem.</description>

      <title>Perfect Zero-Knowledge PCPs for #P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct perfect zero-knowledge probabilistically checkable proofs (PZK-PCPs) for every language in #P. This is the first construction of a PZK-PCP for any language outside BPP. Furthermore, unlike previous constructions of (statistical) zero-knowledge PCPs, our construction simultaneously achieves non-adaptivity and zero knowledge against arbitrary (adaptive) polynomial-time malicious verifiers.
  Our construction consists of a novel masked sumcheck PCP, which uses the combinatorial nullstellensatz to obtain antisymmetric structure within the hypercube and randomness outside of it. To prove zero knowledge, we introduce the notion of locally simulatable encodings: randomised encodings in which every local view of the encoding can be efficiently sampled given a local view of the message. We show that the code arising from the sumcheck protocol (the Reed-Muller code augmented with subcube sums) admits a locally simulatable encoding. This reduces the algebraic problem of simulating our masked sumcheck to a combinatorial property of antisymmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Geometric programming in the Turing model and application to nonnegative tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a geometric programming problem consisting in minimizing a function given by the supremum of finitely many log-Laplace transforms of discrete nonnegative measures on a Euclidean space. Under a coerciveness assumption, we show that a $\varepsilon$-minimizer can be computed in a time that is polynomial in the input size and in $|\log\varepsilon|$. This is obtained by establishing bit-size estimates on approximate minimizers and by applying the ellipsoid method. We also derive polynomial iteration complexity bounds for the interior point method applied to the same class of problems. We deduce that the spectral radius of a partially symmetric, weakly irreducible nonnegative tensor can be approximated within $\varepsilon$ error in poly-time. For strongly irreducible tensors, we also show that the logarithm of the positive eigenvector is poly-time computable. Our results also yield that the the maximum of a nonnegative homogeneous $d$-form in the unit ball with respect to $d$-H\"older norm can be approximated in poly-time. In particular, the spectral radius of uniform weighted hypergraphs and some known upper bounds for the clique number of uniform hypergraphs are poly-time computable.</description>
