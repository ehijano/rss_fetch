      <title>Non-congruence presentations of finite simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results on some special generators of finite simple groups and use them to prove that every non-abelian finite simple group $S$ admits a non-congruence presentation (as conjectured in [CLT24]), and that if $S$ has a non-trivial Schur multiplier, then it admits a smooth cover (as conjectured in [CFLZ]).</description>

      <title>Essential subgroups and essential extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of essential submodules and essential extensions of modules are extended to groups (typically nonabelian), and several necessary and sufficient conditions for a group to possess a proper essential subgroup are investigated. Further, we have completely characterized groups that do not possess a proper essential extension. These observations are used in concluding several properties of groups having essential subgroups. Finally, a short proof of the well-known theorem of Eilenberg and Moore that the only injective object in the category of groups is the trivial group is given.</description>

      <title>Computably locally compact groups and their closed subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a computably locally compact Polish space $M$, we show that its 1-point compactification $M^*$ is computably compact. Then, for a computably locally compact group $G$, we show that the Chabauty space $\mathcal S(G)$ of closed subgroups of $G$ has a canonical effectively-closed (i.e., $\Pi^0_1$) presentation as a subspace of the hyperspace $\mathcal K(G^*)$ of closed sets of $G^*$. We construct a computable discrete abelian group $H$ such that $\mathcal S(H)$ is not computably closed in $\mathcal K(H^*)$; in fact, the only computable points of $\mathcal S(H)$ are the trivial group and $H$ itself, while $\mathcal S(H)$ is uncountable. In the case that a computably locally compact group $G$ is also totally disconnected, we provide a further algorithmic characterization of $\mathcal S(G)$ in terms of the countable meet groupoid of $G$ introduced recently by the authors (arXiv: 2204.09878). We apply our results and techniques to show that the index set of the computable locally compact abelian groups that contain a closed subgroup isomorphic to $(\mathbb{R},+)$ is arithmetical.</description>

      <title>Relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and dual weak left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generalizations of Rota--Baxter groups, Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups have been introduced by Catino, Mazzotta and Stefanelli in 2023. Based on their pioneering results, we continue to study Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and their generalizations in the present paper. Inspired by the corresponding results in Rota--Baxter groups, we firstly obtain some properties and construction methods for Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups, and then study the substructures and quotient structures of these semigroups. On the other hand, we introduce the notion of relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and explore the relationship between these semigroups and dual weak left braces, which are known to give set-theoretical solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation. More specifically, we show that every relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroup gives rise to a dual weak left brace, and conversely, every dual weak left brace can be obtained from a bijective strong relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroup. Furthermore, it turns out that there is an equivalence between the two categories of bijective strong Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and dual weak left braces. The substructures and quotient structures of Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups are also considered.</description>

      <title>Automorphism group of the graph $A(n,k,r)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $[n]^{(k)}$ be the set of all ordered $k$-tuples of distinct elements in $[n]=\{1,2,...,n\}$. The $(n,k,r)$-arrangement graph $A(n,k,r)$ with $1\leq r\leq k\leq n$, is the graph with vertex set $[n]^{(k)}$ and with two $k$-tuples are adjacent if they differ in exactly $r$ coordinates. In this manuscript, we characterize the full automorphism groups of $A(n,k,r)$ in the cases that $1\leq r=k\leq n$ and $r=2&lt;k=n$. Thus, we resolve two special cases of an open problem proposed by Fu-Gang Yin, Yan-Quan Feng, Jin-Xin Zhou and Yu-Hong Guo. In addition, we conclude with a bold conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and classification results for large-type Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the automorphism group of the intersection graph of many large-type Artin groups. This graph is an analogue of the curve graph of mapping class groups but in the context of Artin groups. As an application, we deduce a number of rigidity and classification results for these groups, including computation of outer automorphism groups, commensurability classification, quasi-isometric rigidity, measure equivalence rigidity, orbit equivalence rigidity, rigidity of lattice embedding, and rigidity of cross-product von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>On finite groups whose power graph is claw-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called claw-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph $K_{1, 3}$. The undirected power graph of a group $G$ has vertices the elements of $G$, with an edge between $g_1$ and $g_2$ if one of the two cyclic subgroups $\langle g_1\rangle, \langle g_2\rangle$ is contained in the other. It is denoted by $P(G)$. The reduced power graph, denoted by $P^*(G),$ is the subgraph of $P(G)$ induced by the non-identity elements. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the finite groups whose reduced power graph is claw-free. In particular we prove that if $P^*(G)$ is claw-free, then either $G$ is solvable or $G$ is an almost simple group. In the second case the socle of $G$ is isomorphic to $PSL(2,q)$ for suitable choices of $q$. Finally we prove that if $P^*(G)$ is claw-free, then the order of $G$ is divisible by at most 5 different primes.</description>

      <title>On the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet heuristics lead one to conjecture that the average size of the $p$-torsion in class groups of $G$-extensions of a number field is finite. In a 2021 paper, Lemke Oliver, Wang, and Wood proved this conjecture in the case of $p = 3$ for permutation groups $G$ of the form $C_2 \wr H$ for a broad family of permutation groups $H$, including most nilpotent groups. However, their theorem does not apply for some nilpotent groups of interest, such as $H = C_5$. We extend their results to prove that the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions is finite for any nilpotent group $H$.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime) over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Let M be a closed Riemannian manifold with Kazhdan fundamental group. It is well known that the Cheeger inequality yields a uniform waist inequality in codimension one for the finite covers of M. We show that the finite covers of M also satisfy a uniform waist inequality in codimension two.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry of hyperconvex representations of surface groups in ${\rm PSL}(d,\mathbb{C})$ and their deformation spaces: We produce a natural holomorphic extension of the classical Ahlfors--Bers map to a product of Teichm\"uller spaces of a canonical Riemann surface lamination and prove that the limit set of a hyperconvex representation in the full flag space has Hausdorff dimension 1 if and only if the representation is conjugate in ${\rm PSL}(d,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a virtually RFRS group $G$ of type $\mathrm{FP}_n(\mathbb{Q})$ virtually algebraically fibres with kernel of type $\mathrm{FP}_n(\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if the first $n$ $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of $G$ vanish, that is, $b_p^{(2)}(G) = 0$ for $0 \leqslant p \leqslant n$. We also offer a variant of this result over other fields, in particular in positive characteristic.
  As an application of the main result, we show that virtually amenable RFRS groups of type $\mathrm{FP}(\mathbb{Q})$ are polycyclic-by-finite. It then follows that if $G$ is a virtually RFRS group of type $\mathrm{FP}(\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\mathbb{Z}G$ is Noetherian, then $G$ is polycyclic-by-finite. This answers a longstanding conjecture of Baer for virtually RFRS groups of type $\mathrm{FP}(\mathbb{Q})$.</description>

      <title>On a bijection between a finite group to a non-cyclic group with divisibility of element orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite group $G$ of order $n$ with a prime divisor $p$. In this article, we establish, among other results, that if the Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ is neither cyclic nor generalized quaternion, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $G$ onto the abelian group $C_{\frac{n}{p}}\times C_p$ such that for every element $x$ in $G$, the order of $x$ divides the order of $f(x)$. This resolves Question 1.5 posed in \cite{mohsen}. As application of our results, we show that the group with the third largest value of the sum of element orders in the set of all finite groups of order $n$ is a solvable $p$-nilpotent group where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ such that the Sylow $p$-subgroups are not cyclic.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we give a group-theoretic condition which is equivalent to the fact that the trivial character is the only complex irreducible character of a finite group G which is contained in the principal p-block for each prime p in a specified set of prime divisors of the order of G. This character-theoretic condition has been studied previously by a number of authors.</description>

      <title>On the axiomitization of an optimal noetherian form over the category of sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A noetherian form is an abstract self-dual framework suitable for establishing homomorphism theorems (such as the isomorphism theorems and homological diagram lemmas) for non-abelian, as well as abelian, group-like structures. It can be seen as a unification of semi-abelian categories and Grandis exact categories (two separate generalisations of abelian categories) that retains the self-dual character of Grandis exact categories. In this paper we axiomatise a noetherian form over the category of sets, which, in a suitable sense, is an optimal noetherian form. We then show that every topos has such noetherian form as well, while in the context of a pointed category with finite products and sums, the dual of such noetherian form is exactly the form of subobjects of a semi-abelian category.</description>

      <title>Remarks on discrete subgroups with full limit sets in higher rank Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that real semi-simple Lie groups of higher rank contain (infinitely generated) discrete subgroups with full limit sets in the corresponding Furstenberg boundaries. Additionally, we provide criteria under which discrete subgroups of $G = \operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ must have a full limit set in the Furstenberg boundary of $G$.
  In the appendix, we show the the existence of Zariski-dense discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of $\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, where $n\ge 3$, such that the Jordan projection of some loxodromic element $\gamma \in\Gamma$ lies on the boundary of the limit cone of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Projective rigidity of point-line configurations in the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general setup for studying incidence-preserving motions of projective geometric configurations of points and lines via a "projective rigidity matrix". The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a point-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can be interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix, respectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix for analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions. The symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an autopolarity.</description>
