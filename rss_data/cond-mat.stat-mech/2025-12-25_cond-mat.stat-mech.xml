      <title>Potential energy landscape description with Gamma distribution for supercooled liquids and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential energy landscape, PEL, theory stands as one of the most successful frameworks for understanding supercooled liquids and glassy systems. A central element of this theory is the configurational entropy, Sc, which is traditionally represented by a symmetric Gaussian distribution. However, the asymmetric nature of the potential energy of inherent structures, Eis, poses a challenge to such a representation across wide regions of configurational space. In addition, the Gaussian distribution fails to represent fragile to strong transition, FST, observed in various fluids. In this work, we demonstrate that an asymmetric distribution, specifically the Gamma distribution, provides effective description of both Sc and Eis over broad ranges of density and temperature, T. The FST is interpreted through shifts of the Eis distribution and the curvature change of the Eis vs 1/T relation. In terms of energy changes, the FST is comparable to a liquid-liquid phase transition. Moreover, the revised PEL framework yields an equation of state that incorporates a singular term diverging at a glassy or jammed state, an important feature for accurately describing the pressure behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Collective behavior of independent scaled Brownian particles with renewal resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collective dynamics of an ensemble of $N\gg 1$ independent particles undergoing anomalous diffusion with random renewal resetting. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H}$, where $H&gt;0$. The particles independently reset to the origin, and each particle's clock is set to zero upon spatial resetting. Employing the known steady-state position distribution of a \emph{single} particle undergoing the sBm with renewal resetting [Bodrova et al., Phys. Rev. E \textbf{100}, 012120 (2019)], we study the collective dynamics of $N$ particles. We determine the statistics of the system radius $\ell$. The typical fluctuations of $\ell$ fall under the Gumbel universality class, and we use extreme value statistics to calculate the moments of $\ell$. We also study the large-deviation statistics of the center of mass (COM), where for $H&gt;1/2$ we uncover an anomalous scaling behavior of the COM distribution, and a singularity in the corresponding rate function, due to a ``big jump" effect.</description>

      <title>Universality of equilibration dynamics after quantum quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (entanglement spectrum) after a global quantum quench. We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined from the R\'enyi entropies. We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas. We benchmark our analytical results in free-fermion chains, such as the transverse field Ising chain and the XX chain, in the rule 54 chain, and in Bethe ansatz solvable spin models.</description>

      <title>Inter-defect interactions, oxygen-vacancy distribution, and oxidation in acceptor-doped ABO3 perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of inter-defect interaction on the defect thermodynamics, local structure, and oxidation of acceptor-doped wide-gap ABO3 perovskites are explored using the developed statistical theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications.</description>

      <title>The effects of solvent quality and core wetting on the circularization of star polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of cyclical arms in star polymers, focusing on the effects of solvent quality on their resulting linking complexity and gyration radius. We find that polymers circularized in bad solvent present a higher degree of linking among arms with respect to those circularized in good solvent. When both are transported to good solvent, this results in a smaller gyration radius of the former with respect to the latter. This effect is magnified when the polymers present a sufficiently small number of arms (or functionality $f$): in this case, in bad solvent, all arms tend to clump together on one side of the central core, due to circularization, and can hence all interact with each other. Instead, when $f$ is large enough, the whole surface of the core is wetted by the arms, whose distribution becomes radially symmetric. This hinders interactions between faraway arms and reduces the probability of inter-arm linking. Interestingly, we find that both the critical $f_c$ at which the clump transition happens and the minimal arm length $n_c$ for which the transition appears depend on the core size: the grafting density of the arms must be larger than a certain constant $\rho_g^c$, while their length must be sufficient to stretch for, at least, half of the core's circumference.</description>

      <title>Instanton theory and fluctuation corrections to the thermal nucleation rate of a ferromagnetic superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a field-theoretical description of thermal nucleation in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic superfluid, a quantum-gas analogue of false-vacuum decay. The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate from fluctuations in the metastable phase follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point configuration of the energy functional -- the critical droplet -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations of this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for the critical droplet in the limit of small potential tilts, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and its signature on experimental images of a nucleating gas, and should allow for a rigorous comparison between nucleation theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic sampling of materials using neutral-atom quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum hardware has emerged as a promising platform for programmable many-body physics. In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $\alpha_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = \alpha_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $\Delta_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $\Delta\mu$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem during Domain Growth in the Long-range Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated {\it fluctuation dissipation theorem} (FDT) does not apply to nonequilibrium systems. In this context, Cugliandolo and Kurchan [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 71}, 173 (1993)] introduced a generalized FDT which interprets the nonequilibrium evolution as a composition of {\it time sectors} corresponding to different {\it effective temperatures}. We use this framework to study domain growth in the $d=2$ long-range Ising model (LRIM) with nonconserved kinetics ({\it Glauber spin-flip}) and conserved kinetics ({\it Kawasaki spin-exchange}). We study the dynamical scaling and super-universal (SU) scaling of various two-time quantities, e.g., autocorrelation function, response function, effective temperature, etc. In particular, we investigate how the interaction range and conservation laws affect these characteristic features of domain growth.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and hyperforce correlation theory for equilibrium fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures. Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact 3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables. Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar parallel walls.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the geometry behind classical Heisenberg model at the level suitable for third or fourth year students who did not have the opportunity to take a course on differential geometry. The arguments presented here rely solely on elementary algebraic concepts such as vectors, dual vectors and tensors, as well as Hamiltonian equations and Poisson brackets in their simplest form. We derive Poisson brackets for classical spins, along with the corresponding equations of motion for classical Heisenberg model, starting from the geometry of two-sphere, thereby demonstrating the relevance of standard canonical procedure in the case of Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. Moreover, this phenomenon has been never tested across a continuous glass transition between a liquid phase and a glassy state with large but finite viscosity. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap opens continuously at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. By extracting the instantaneous shear velocity from the experimental data, we uncover a shear relaxation time exhibiting a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence characteristic of glass-forming materials, accurately described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Our results confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework and highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating extremely low-entangled approximate state designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. We discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, from which almost all quantum states can be efficiently certified by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and classical post-processing time.</description>

      <title>A strong-weak duality for the 1d long-range Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. In the critical regime, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$, this system realizes a family of nontrivial one-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), whose data vary continuously with $s$. For $s&gt;1$ the model has instead no phase transition at finite temperature, as in the short-range case. In the standard field-theoretic description, involving a generalized free field with quartic interactions, the critical model is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled in the vicinity of the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We introduce a dual formulation that becomes weakly coupled as $s \to 1$. Precisely at $s=1$, the dual description becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition of the two-dimensional free scalar. We present a detailed study of the dual model and demonstrate its effectiveness by computing perturbatively the CFT data near $s=1$, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in $1-s$, by two independent approaches: (i) standard renormalization of our dual field-theoretic description and (ii) the analytic conformal bootstrap. The two methods yield complete agreement.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the proposal of Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] where the role of a hot reservoir in a four-stroke cycle was replaced by a quantum measurement apparatus, the other steps being two quantum adiabatic strokes and thermalization with a cold reservoir. We propose a five-stroke cycle, where an ergotropy extracting stroke is introduced following the measurement stroke, and study the effect of measurements of different spin components on the performance of the machine. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine ( {without the adiabatic strokes}) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate, for specific cases (e.g. x-x), a definite ordering may be obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.</description>

      <title>Circuit-based characterization of finite-temperature quantum phases and self-correcting quantum memory</title>

Abstract: Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.</description>
