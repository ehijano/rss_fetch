      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. We additionally observe that moving to strong cavity field gradients leads to an instability towards a sliding Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, featuring a strong density modulation in the gradient direction. Finally, by exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Negative Mass Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, one analyzes two systems trying to obtain physical conditions where some properties attributed to negative mass can be mimicked by positive mass particles. The first one is the well-known 1/2-spin system described by the Dirac equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Assuming some physical restrictions, one obtains that the use of $e\rightarrow-e$ can lead to the same results as using $m\rightarrow-m$. In particular, for a null dielectric function, it is possible to obtain a negative mass behavior from a positive mass system composed of negatively charged particles. The second system is based on the de Broglie matter wave. The dispersion relation of such a wave can be negative (real or imaginary valued) if one assumes an imaginary wavenumber. The consequence is the emergence of a negative refractive index for positive mass particles. However, this behavior is generally attributed to a negative mass system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometry of the Haldane Model under a Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Capillary condensation between non-parallel walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the condensation of fluids confined by a pair of non-parallel plates of finite height $H$. We show that such a system experiences two types of condensation, termed single- and double-pinning, which can be characterized by one (single-pinning) or two (double-pinning) edge contact angles describing the shape of menisci pinned at the system edges. For both types of capillary condensation we formulate the Kelvin-like equation and determine the conditions under which the given type of condensation occurs. We construct the global phase diagram revealing a reentrant phenomenon pertinent to the change of the capillary condensation type upon varying the inclination of the walls. Asymptotic properties of the system are discussed and a link with related phase phenomena in different systems is made. Finally, we show that the change from a single- to a double-pinned state is a continuous transition, the character of which depends on the wetting properties of the walls.</description>

      <title>Midgap states induced by Zeeman field and $p$ wave superconductor pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is central to band topology in condensed matter physics, which allows us to understand and design distinct topological states. In this work, we find another mechanism to analogize the SSH model in a spinful system, realizing an obstructed atomic insulator by introducing intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman field. In our model, the midgap states originate from a quantized hidden polarization with invariant index $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) due to the local inversion symmetry breaking. When the global inversion symmetry is broken, a charge pumping is designed by tuning the polarization. Moreover, by introducing the $p+ip$ superconductor pairing potential, a new topological phase dubbed obstructed superconductor (OSC) is identified. This new state is characterized by invariant index $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) and nonchiral midgap states. More interestingly, these nonchiral edge states result in a chiral-like nonlocal conductance, which is different from the traditional chiral topological superconductor. Our findings not only find another strategy to achieve a spinful SSH model but also predict the existence of OSC, providing a promising avenue for further exploration of its transport properties.</description>
