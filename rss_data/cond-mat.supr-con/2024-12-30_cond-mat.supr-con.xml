      <title>Fractional vortex array realized at twin boundary in a nematic superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a framework of two-component Ginzburg-Landau theory as a model of superconducting FeSe, we study the spatial structure of vortex states in the presence of nematic twin boundary in an s + d wave nematic superconductor. The result shows that the orientation of the nematic vortex core is rotated 90 degrees across the twin boundary, and just at the twin boundary the nematic vortex becomes two fractional vortices with the topological nature of core-down and core-up merons. The exotic vortex states may be confirmed by observing the time evolution of vortex flow when the vortices are trapped in and escape from the nematic twin boundary.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic and tunable vortex topology in multiband iron-based superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19096v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the multiband nature of iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), we have uncovered pronounced anisotropy in Majorana vortex topology arising from the interaction between vortex orientation and multiple electronic topologies. This anisotropy manifests in two distinct vortex configurations: the z-vortex and x-vortex, oriented perpendicular and parallel to the Dirac axis (z-axis for FeSCs), respectively. The x-vortex exhibits a unique duality, displaying two distinct topological phase diagrams. One is strikingly simple, comprising only trivial and topological superconducting phases, and remains resilient to multiband entanglement. The other mirrors the z-vortex's complex diagram, featuring alternating trivial, topological crystalline and topological superconducting phases. Crucially, the former is exclusive to the x-vortex and supports unpaired Majorana vortices across a wide parameter range, even with Dirac nodes in electronic bands. Notably, uniaxial strain can modulate these x-vortex phases, enabling the x-vortex to support both stable Majorana vortices and rich exotic physics in a controllable manner. Moreover, we propose that the x-vortex offers promising advantages for developing iron-based superconducting quantum devices. Our findings introduce a novel paradigm in vortex topology within multiband superconducting systems, highlighting the x-vortex as a promising platform for exploring Majorana physics and advancing iron-based superconducting quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Transformation of the trapped flux in a SC disc under electromagnetic exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting permanent magnets (SCs) with trapped magnetic flux are used in technical devices (motors, generators, etc.). These magnets endure repeated magnetic "shocks" during operation, which can affect their performance. In this work, we investigated the dynamic behavior of magnetic induction in the trapped flux in an SC disk when exposed to stepwise changes in the external magnetic field, simulating these operational shocks. Our results reveal a direct correlation between the stepwise changes in the magnetic field and the trapped flux response, with each increase or decrease in the field inducing a corresponding 40-50% change in trapped flux for a 600 G field step at temperature of 5 K. The magnitude of these changes depends on the external parameters and their dynamics could lead to additional energy dissipation and potential heating, which may affect the reliability of SC magnets in applications. A scaling analysis of the induction flux profiles, revealing roughness exponents in the range of 0.435 to 0.475 was performed as well, and we determined the Hausdorff dimension of the surface structure.</description>

      <title>Two superconducting thin films systems with potential integration of different quantum functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation based on superconducting circuits utilizes superconducting qubits with Josephson tunnel junctions. Engineering high-coherence qubits requires materials optimization. In this work, we present two superconducting thin film systems, grown on silicon (Si), and one obtained from the other via annealing. Cobalt (Co) thin films grown on Si were found to be superconducting [EPL 131 (2020) 47001]. These films also happen to be a self-organised hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) structure. The S/F/S hybrids are important for superconducting $\pi$-qubits [PRL 95 (2005) 097001] and in quantum information processing. Here we present our results on the superconductivity of a hybrid Co film followed by the superconductivity of a CoSi$_2$ film, which was prepared by annealing the Co film. CoSi$_2$, with its $1/f$ noise about three orders of magnitude smaller compared to the most commonly used superconductor aluminium (Al), is a promising material for high-coherence qubits. The hybrid Co film revealed superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ = 5 K and anisotropy in the upper critical field between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The anisotropy was of the order of ratio of lateral dimensions to thickness of the superconducting Co grains, suggesting a quasi-2D nature of superconductivity. On the other hand, CoSi$_2$ film showed a $T_c$ of 900 mK. In the resistivity vs. temperature curve, we observe a peak near $T_c$. Magnetic field scan as a function of $T$ shows a monotonic increase in intensity of this peak with temperature. The origin of the peak has been explained in terms of parallel resistive model for the particular measurement configuration. Although our CoSi$_2$ film contains grain boundaries, we observed a perpendicular critical field of 15 mT and a critical current density of 3.8x10$^7$ A/m$^2$, comparable with epitaxial CoSi$_2$ films.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid transport and strong mass enhancement near the nematic quantum critical point in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is often accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, which emerges near a quantum critical point (QCP) - a point where an electronic ordered phase is terminated at absolute zero under non-thermal parameters. While nematic orders, characterized by broken rotational symmetry, are sometimes found in unconventional superconductors, the role of nematic fluctuations in driving NFL transport behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated electrical and thermoelectric transport properties in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films and observed hallmark NFL behavior: temperature-linear resistivity and logarithmic divergence of thermoelectricity at low temperatures. Notably, the thermoelectricity peaks sharply at the nematic QCP ($x$ = 0.45), highlighting the dominant role of nematic fluctuations in the NFL transport. Furthermore, we found that the pair-breaking mechanisms in the superconducting phase crosses over from orbital- to Pauli-limited effects, indicating the mass enhancement near the nematic critical regime. These findings reveal the profound impact of nematic fluctuations on both normal-state transport and superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Strong pair-density-wave fluctuations in an exactly solvable doped Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice, which describes both a Mott insulator at half-filling and a non-Fermi liquid phase on doping. Through the solution of this exactly solvable model with the inclusion of pairing interactions, we demonstrate the emergence of strong pair-density-wave (PDW) fluctuations associated with center-of-mass momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(\pi,\pi)$ at finite temperatures for low dopings up to a critical doping and intermediate $U$ interaction. Furthermore, we also confirm that a superconducting instability appears in the model within a wide regime of interaction $U$ and doping parameter $x$. In view of the fact that it has been recently put forward that the metal-insulator transition of the HK model belongs to the same universality class as the Mott transition of the paradigmatic Hubbard model [Huang \emph{et al.}, Nat. Phys. \textbf{18}, 511 (2022)], our work may thus shed light on an interesting scenario regarding the emergence of a fluctuating PDW phase on doping a Mott insulator, which has been argued to be relevant for understanding the physics of the cuprate superconductors in the underdoped regime.</description>

      <title>Emergent Intermediate Phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model from Tensor Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model on a square lattice using a tensor network approach designed for frustrated spin systems. This model, characterized by competing nearest-neighbor and next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, exhibits a complex interplay between $U(1)$ and $Z_2$ symmetries. Our study reveals an emergent intermediate phase around $J_2/J_1 \sim 0.505$, which is characterized by a $Z_2$ long-range stripe order without phase coherence in the XY spins. The intermediate phase features two well-separated phase transitions: a higher-temperature Ising transition and a lower-temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The relative separation between these transitions is significantly larger than previously reported, enabling a clearer investigation of their distinct thermodynamic properties. For $0.5&lt;J_2/J_1 &lt; 0.501$, two transitions merge into a single first-order phase transition, a phenomenon that cannot be explained solely by mapping to the Ising-XY model. As $J_2/J_1 \to \infty$, the transition evolves continuously into the BKT universality class. These findings advance the understanding of the mechanisms driving phase transitions in frustrated spin systems and suggest potential experimental realizations in platforms such as ultracold atoms, Josephson junction arrays, and optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>

      <title>Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Doping evolution of the normal state magnetic excitations in pressurized La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The doping evolution behaviors of the normal state magnetic excitations (MEs) of the nickelate La3Ni2O7 are theoretically studied in this paper. For a filling of n = 3.0 which corresponds roughly to the material which realizes the superconductivity of about 80 K under moderately high pressures above 14 GPa, the MEs exhibit a square-like pattern centered at (0,0) which originates from the intrapocket particle-hole scatterings. Furthermore, it was found that the MEs show very strong modulations on the interlayer momentum qz. With the increasing of qz, the patterns of the MEs change dramatically. In the large qz regime, they turn to be ruled by the interpocket excitation modes with significantly larger intensity which may play a vital role in the superconducting pairing. This hidden feature of the MEs was not revealed by previous studies. The established features of the MEs are found to be very robust against doping. They persist in the wide hole- or electron-doping regime around n = 3.0. However, in the heavily electron-doped regime, a Lifshitz transition will occur. Consequently, the behaviors of the MEs change qualitatively across this transition. With the absence of the hole pocket, we predict that a strong tendency toward the spin-density-wave (SDW) order will develop due to the perfect nesting between the electron and the hole pockets at n = 4.0. Thus, we have investigated the normal state behaviors of the MEs and their doping evolutions which may shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>Detailed Analysis of the Superconducting Gap with Dynes Pair-Breaking Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy gap within the Dynes superconductor theory. This model generalizes the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) approach by including the pair-breaking scattering, introducing the tunneling in-gap states up to a Fermi level. We analytically solve the energy gap equation in various limit cases. The solution provides simple tools for further studies, compared to more complex numerics, and highlights the basic characteristics of the theory. First, in the critical limit of pair-breaking scattering, we derive an analytical form of zero-temperature gap to transition temperature ratio. Next, we derive the dependence of the energy gap close to critical temperature and look at its behavior for general and critical pair-breaking scattering rate. Furthermore, we compare our result with the numerical solution of the gap equation assuming general temperature. We show the range of temperatures, for which the analytical approximation is valid. In the end, we provide the approximative formula of the gap, assuming general pair-breaking scattering, emphasizing its exact behavior close to transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Electronic states in superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal: 1T-PdSeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the surface and bulk electronic structures of the superconducting type-II Dirac semimetal 1T-PdSeTe. The superconducting transition temperature $T_C = 3.2$ K was almost twice as high as $T_C = 1.6$ K in 1T-PdTe$_2$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements showed homogeneously mixed Se and Te atoms in the chalcogen layers, consistent with the CdI$_2$-type crystal structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations indicated the existence of the topological surface states, and the overall band structures were similar to those of 1T-PdTe$_2$. These results suggest that CdI$_2$-type lattice symmetry dictates the band dispersion, regardless of atomic disorder in the chalcogen layers. As the electronic band dispersion and the local structures were persistent upon substitution, the enhancement of $T_C$ is likely associated with the chemical pressure. Our results provide insight into the effects of the solid solution on the surface and bulk electronic states as well as the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Spin density wave in the bilayered nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at ambient pressure</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in high-pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ has garnered significant attention. Using density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at ambient pressure. Our calculations suggest that with $\delta=0$, the double spin stripe phase is favored as the magnetic ground state. Oxygen vacancies may effectively turn nearest Ni spins into \textit{charge} sites. Consequently, with moderate $\delta$ values, our theoretical magnetic ground state exhibits characteristics of both double spin stripe and spin-charge stripe configurations, providing a natural explanation to reconcile the seemingly contradictory experimental findings that suggest both the configurations as candidates for the spin-density-wave phase. With higher $\delta$ values, we anticipate the ground state to become a spin-glass-like noncollinear magnetic phase with only short-range order. The oxygen vacancies are expected to significantly impact the magnetic excitations and the transition temperatures $T_{SDW}$. Notably, the magnetic ordering also induces concomitant charge ordering and orbital ordering, driven by spin-lattice coupling under the low symmetry magnetic order. We further offer a plausible explanation for the experimental observations that the measured $T_{SDW}$ appears insensitive to the variation of samples and the lack of direct evidence for long-range magnetic ordering.</description>
