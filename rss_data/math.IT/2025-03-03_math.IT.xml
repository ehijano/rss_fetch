      <title>Overlapped Arithmetic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arithmetic codes are usually deemed as the most important means to implement lossless source coding, whose principle is mapping every source symbol to a sub-interval in [0, 1). For every source symbol, the length of its mapping sub-interval is exactly equal to its probability. With this symbol-interval mapping rule, the interval [0,1) will be fully covered and there is neither overlapped sub-interval (corresponds to more than one source symbol) nor forbidden sub-interval (does not correspond to any source symbol).
  It is well-known that there is a duality between source coding and channel coding, so every good source code may also be a good channel code meanwhile, and vice versa. Inspired by this duality, arithmetic codes can be easily generalized to address many coding problems beyond source coding by redefining the source-interval mapping rule. If every source symbol is mapped to an enlarged sub-interval, the mapping sub-intervals of different source symbols will be partially overlapped and we obtain overlapped arithmetic codes, which can realize distributed source coding. On the contrary, if every source symbol is mapped to a narrowed sub-interval, there will be one or more forbidden sub-intervals in [0, 1) that do not correspond to any source symbol and we obtain forbidden arithmetic codes, which can implement joint source-channel coding. Furthermore, by allowing the coexistence of overlapped sub-intervals and forbidden sub-intervals, we will obtain hybrid arithmetic codes, which can cope with distributed joint source-channel coding.</description>

      <title>A finite sufficient set of conditions for catalytic majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majorization relation has found numerous applications in mathematics, quantum information and resource theory, and quantum thermodynamics, where it describes the allowable transitions between two physical states. In many cases, when state vector $x$ does not majorize state vector $y$, it is nevertheless possible to find a catalyst - another vector $z$ such that $x \otimes z$ majorizes $y \otimes z$. Determining the feasibility of such catalytic transformation typically involves checking an infinite set of inequalities. Here, we derive a finite sufficient set of inequalities that imply catalysis. Extending this framework to thermodynamics, we also establish a finite set of sufficient conditions for catalytic state transformations under thermal operations. For novel examples, we provide a software toolbox implementing these conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformer-based Decoder for Varshamov-Tenengolts Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rise of DNA data storage technology has brought significant attention to the challenge of correcting insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. Among various coding methods for IDS correction, Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes, primarily designed for single-error correction, have emerged as a central research focus. While existing decoding methods achieve high accuracy in correcting a single error, they often fail to correct multiple IDS errors. In this work, we observe that VT codes retain some capability for addressing multiple errors by introducing a transformer-based VT decoder (TVTD) along with symbol- and statistic-based codeword embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TVTD achieves perfect correction of a single error. Furthermore, when decoding multiple errors across various codeword lengths, the bit error rate and frame error rate are significantly improved compared to existing hard decision and soft-in soft-out algorithms. Additionally, through model architecture optimization, the proposed method reduces time consumption by an order of magnitude compared to other soft decoders.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rates for Information Extraction from a Strategic Sender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a setting of non-cooperative communication where a receiver wants to recover randomly generated sequences of symbols that are observed by a strategic sender. The sender aims to maximize an average utility that may not align with the recovery criterion of the receiver, whereby the signals it sends may not be truthful. The rate of communication is defined as the number of reconstructions corresponding to the sequences recovered correctly while communicating with the sender. We pose this problem as a sequential game between the sender and the receiver with the receiver as the leader and determine strategies for the receiver that attain vanishing probability of error and compute the rates of such strategies. We show the existence of such strategies under a condition on the utility of the sender. For the case of the binary alphabet, this condition is also necessary, in the absence of which, the probability of error goes to one for all choices of strategies of the receiver. We show that for reliable recovery, the receiver chooses to correctly decode only a $\textit{subset}$ of messages received from the sender and deliberately makes an error on messages outside this subset.
  Despite a clean channel, our setting exhibits a non-trivial $\textit{maximum}$ rate of communication, which is in general strictly less than the capacity of the channel. This implies the impossibility of strategies that correctly decode sequences of rate greater than the maximum rate while also achieving reliable communication. This is a key point of departure from the usual setting of cooperative communication.</description>

      <title>Local Geometry Determines Global Landscape in Low-rank Factorization for Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orthogonal group synchronization problem, which focuses on recovering orthogonal group elements from their corrupted pairwise measurements, encompasses examples such as high-dimensional Kuramoto model on general signed networks, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization, community detection under stochastic block models, and orthogonal Procrustes problem. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) has proven its power in solving this problem; however, its expensive computational costs impede its widespread practical applications. We consider the Burer-Monteiro factorization approach to the orthogonal group synchronization, an effective and scalable low-rank factorization to solve large scale SDPs. Despite the significant empirical successes of this factorization approach, it is still a challenging task to understand when the nonconvex optimization landscape is benign, i.e., the optimization landscape possesses only one local minimizer, which is also global. In this work, we demonstrate that if the degree of freedom within the factorization exceeds twice the condition number of the ``Laplacian" (certificate matrix) at the global minimizer, the optimization landscape is absent of spurious local minima. Our main theorem is purely algebraic and versatile, and it seamlessly applies to all the aforementioned examples: the nonconvex landscape remains benign under almost identical condition that enables the success of the SDR. Additionally, we illustrate that the Burer-Monteiro factorization is robust to ``monotone adversaries", mirroring the resilience of the SDR. In other words, introducing ``favorable" adversaries into the data will not result in the emergence of new spurious local minimizers.</description>

      <title>Quantum error-correcting codes from projective Reed-Muller codes and their hull variation problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long quantum codes using projective Reed-Muller codes are constructed. Projective Reed-Muller codes are evaluation codes obtained by evaluating homogeneous polynomials at the projective space. We obtain asymmetric and symmetric quantum codes by using the CSS construction and the Hermitian construction, respectively. We provide entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes from projective Reed-Muller codes with flexible amounts of entanglement by considering equivalent codes. Moreover, we also construct quantum codes from subfield subcodes of projective Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Timely Status Updates in Slotted ALOHA Networks With Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the age of information (AoI) in a scenario where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a gateway following the slotted ALOHA protocol and receive no feedback. We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to lattices constructed based on polar-like codes and demonstrate some of their key properties, such as AWGN goodness. We first present polar lattices directly from the perspective of their generator matrix. Next, we discuss their connection with the recently proposed PAC (polarization adjusted convolutional) lattices and analyze the structural advantages of PAC lattices, through which the AWGN-goodness of PAC lattices can be conveniently demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal List-Recovery of Linear Code Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results on linear codes achieving list-recovery capacity. We show that random linear codes achieve list-recovery capacity with constant output list size (independent of the alphabet size and length). That is, over alphabets of size at least $\ell^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$, random linear codes of rate $R$ are $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, (\ell/\varepsilon)^{O(\ell/\varepsilon)})$-list-recoverable for all $R\in(0,1)$ and $\ell$. Together with a result of Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya, this implies that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes also achieve list-recovery capacity. We also prove that our output list size is near-optimal among all linear codes: all $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, L)$-list-recoverable linear codes must have $L\ge \ell^{\Omega(R/\varepsilon)}$.
  Our simple upper bound combines the Zyablov-Pinsker argument with recent bounds from Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, Wootters, and Tamo on the maximum intersection of a "list-recovery ball" and a low-dimensional subspace with large distance. Our lower bound is inspired by a recent lower bound of Chen and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for the Multi-User MIMO Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers exhibit great potential in assisting classical wireless communications due to their outstanding advantages in detecting radio frequency signals. To realize this potential, we integrate a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver into a classical multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme to form a multi-user Rydberg atomic quantum MIMO (RAQ-MIMO) system for the uplink. To study this system, we first construct an equivalent baseband signal model, which facilitates convenient system design, signal processing and optimizations. We then study the ergodic achievable rates under both the maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) schemes by deriving their tight lower bounds. We next compare the ergodic achievable rates of the RAQ-MIMO and the conventional massive MIMO schemes by offering a closed-form expression for the difference of their ergodic achievable rates, which allows us to directly compare the two systems. Our results show that RAQ-MIMO allows the average transmit power of users to be $&gt; 25$ dBm lower than that of the conventional massive MIMO. Viewed from a different perspective, an extra $\sim 8.8$ bits/s/Hz/user rate becomes achievable by ZF RAQ-MIMO.</description>

      <title>ResiComp: Loss-Resilient Image Compression via Dual-Functional Masked Visual Token Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural image codecs (NICs) are of significant compression performance, but limited attention has been paid to their error resilience.
  These resulting NICs tend to be sensitive to packet losses, which are prevalent in real-time communications.
  In this paper, we investigate how to elevate the resilience ability of NICs to combat packet losses.
  We propose ResiComp, a pioneering neural image compression framework with feature-domain packet loss concealment (PLC).
  Motivated by the inherent consistency between generation and compression, we advocate merging the tasks of entropy modeling and PLC into a unified framework focused on latent space context modeling.
  To this end, we take inspiration from the impressive generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly the recent advances of masked visual token modeling (MVTM).
  During training, we integrate MVTM to mirror the effects of packet loss, enabling a dual-functional Transformer to restore the masked latents by predicting their missing values and conditional probability mass functions.
  Our ResiComp jointly optimizes compression efficiency and loss resilience.
  Moreover, ResiComp provides flexible coding modes, allowing for explicitly adjusting the efficiency-resilience trade-off in response to varying Internet or wireless network conditions.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResiComp can significantly enhance the NIC's resilience against packet losses, while exhibits a worthy trade-off between compression efficiency and packet loss resilience.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Combinatorial Semi-bandits with Graph Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations.</description>
