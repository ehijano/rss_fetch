      <title>Time-Varying Model Predictive Attitude Control for Magnetically Actuated Dual-Spin Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude control hardware for small satellites is often limited in power and space availability given the importance of the science instruments they exist to transport. To mitigate this, a dual-spin stabilized satellite actuated via magnetic torque rods reduces the space and power required of the attitude control system, but may require advanced control policies. This paper explores the attitude control of a magnetically actuated dual-spin stabilized CubeSat with model predictive control using time-varying prediction dynamics. An inertial pointing objective is used as a representative mission, where the satellite is able to deviate from its nominal orientation within some allowable amount. Three time-varying MPC policies are developed and compared to ensure the system does not violate constraints while minimizing control effort. These policies include a prediction model that accounts for the orbital position of the satellite and two iterative approaches that incorporate control inputs through either propagation of the linear dynamics, or nonlinear propagation with successive linearization. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear prediction policy outperforms other prediction methods with regards to not only minimal actuation, but to constraint satisfaction as well while imparting minimal computational burden.</description>

      <title>Energy partition in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a simple and straightforward method to derive the energy partition in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence that was first studied by Lee and then more rigorously by Chandrasekhar. By investigating the energy equation we find that the turbulent viscous and ohmic dissipations are comparable to each other. Under the condition that turbulent viscosity and turbulent magnetic diffusivity are comparable, we deduce that the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies depends on the ratio of the turbulent magnetic lengthscale to turbulent velocity lengthscale of the largest eddies. When the two largest lengthscales are comparable, the two energies are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>Energy partitioning between thermal and non-thermal electrons and ions in magnetotail reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy release event. It plays an important role in accelerating particles to high non-thermal energies. These particles often exhibit energy spectra characterized by a power-law distribution. However, the partitioning of energy between thermal and non-thermal components, and between ions and electrons, remains unclear. This study provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of magnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become \textit{softer} (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non-thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection.</description>
