      <title>Putting Fair Division on the Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fair division of indivisible goods is not only a subject of theoretical research, but also an important problem in practice, with solutions being offered on several online platforms. Little is known, however, about the characteristics of real-world allocation instances and how they compare to synthetic instances. Using dimensionality reduction, we compute a \map of allocation instances: a 2-dimensional embedding such that an instance's location on the map is predictive of the instance's origin and other key instance features. Because the axes of this map closely align with the utility matrix's two largest singular values, we define a second, explicit map, which we theoretically characterize.</description>

      <title>Approximately Dominating Sets in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condorcet's paradox is a fundamental result in social choice theory which states that there exist elections in which, no matter which candidate wins, a majority of voters prefer a different candidate. In fact, even if we can select any $k$ winners, there still may exist another candidate that would beat each of the winners in a majority vote. That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets.
  We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.
  Our proof uses a simple probabilistic construction using samples from a maximal lottery, a well-studied distribution over candidates derived from the Nash equilibrium of a two-player game. In stark contrast to general approximate equilibria, which may require support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies, we show that maximal lotteries can be approximated with constant support size. These approximate maximal lotteries may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Panel Complexity of Sortition: Is 12 Angry Men Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sortition is the practice of delegating public decision-making to randomly selected panels. Recently, it has gained momentum worldwide through its use in citizens' assemblies, sparking growing interest within the computer science community. One key appeal of sortition is that random panels tend to be more representative of the population than elected committees or parliaments. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel definition of representative panels, based on the Wasserstein distance from statistical learning theory. Using this definition, we develop a framework for analyzing the panel complexity problem -- determining the required panel size to ensure desirable properties. We focus on three key desiderata: (1) that efficiency at the panel level extends to the whole population, measured by social welfare; (2) that fairness guarantees for the panel translate to fairness for the population, captured by the core; and (3) that the probability of an outlier panel, for which the decision significantly deviates from the optimal one, remains low. We establish near-tight panel complexity guarantees for these desiderata across two fundamental social choice settings: participatory budgeting and facility location.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Fair Division: Chores Are Easier Than Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dividing items among agents, two of the most widely studied fairness notions are envy-freeness and proportionality. We consider a setting where $m$ chores are allocated to $n$ agents and the disutility of each chore for each agent is drawn from a probability distribution. We show that an envy-free allocation exists with high probability provided that $m \ge 2n$, and moreover, $m$ must be at least $n+\Theta(n)$ in order for the existence to hold. On the other hand, we prove that a proportional allocation is likely to exist as long as $m = \omega(1)$, and this threshold is asymptotically tight. Our results reveal a clear contrast with the allocation of goods, where a larger number of items is necessary to ensure existence for both notions.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Time Preferences on the Price of Anarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of agents' myopic optimization on the efficiency of systems comprised by many selfish agents. In contrast to standard congestion games where agents interact in a one-shot fashion, in our model each agent chooses an infinite sequence of actions and maximizes the total reward stream discounted over time under different ways of computing present values. Our model assumes that actions consume common resources that get congested, and the action choice by an agent affects the completion times of actions chosen by other agents, which in turn affects the time rewards are accrued and their discounted value. This is a mean-field game, where an agent's reward depends on the decisions of the other agents through the resulting action completion times. For this type of game we define stationary equilibria, and analyze their existence and price of anarchy (PoA). Overall, we find that the PoA depends entirely on the type of discounting rather than its specific parameters. For exponential discounting, myopic behaviour leads to extreme inefficiency: the PoA is infinity for any value of the discount parameter. For power law discounting, such inefficiency is greatly reduced and the PoA is 2 whenever stationary equilibria exist. This matches the PoA when there is no discounting and players maximize long-run average rewards. Additionally, we observe that exponential discounting may introduce unstable equilibria in learning algorithms, if action completion times are interdependent. In contrast, under no discounting all equilibria are stable.</description>

      <title>On the Approximate Core and Nucleon of Flow Games with Public Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate flow games featuring both private arcs owned by individual players and public arcs accessible cost-free to all coalitions. We explore two solution concepts within this framework: the approximate core and the nucleon. The approximate core relaxes core requirements by permitting a bounded relative payoff deviation for every coalition, and the nucleon is a multiplicative analogue of Schmeidler's nucleolus which lexicographically maximizes the vector consisting of relative payoff deviations for every coalition arranged in a non-decreasing order. By leveraging a decomposition property for paths and cycles in a flow network, we derive complete characterizations for the approximate core and demonstrate that the nucleon can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Private Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14356v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Private signals model noisy information about an unknown state. Although these signals are called "private," they may still carry information about each other. Our paper introduces the concept of private private signals, which contain information about the state but not about other signals. To achieve privacy, signal quality may need to be sacrificed. We study the informativeness of private private signals and characterize those that are optimal in the sense that they cannot be made more informative without violating privacy. We discuss implications for privacy in recommendation systems, information design, causal inference, and mechanism design.</description>
