      <title>Wave scattering by a transversal defect in a discrete waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wave scattering by a finite transversal strip in a discrete square-lattice waveguide with Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the strip and the waveguide walls. The setting is motivated as a discrete analogue of the classical continuous waveguide problem with a screen. The corresponding Wiener--Hopf formulation leads to an equation with a $4 \times 4$ matrix kernel, which reduces to a $2 \times 2$ matrix kernel under some symmetry assumptions. The factorisation prospects of this kernel are discussed, but this route is not followed. Instead, an exact analytical solution is obtained using the pole removal technique. This contrasts with the continuous case, where only approximate solutions are currently available. The reflection and transmission coefficients resulting from an incident duct mode are computed with an accuracy up to $10^{-13}$, showing consistency with theoretical predictions from continuous waveguide theory. In particular, full reflection and zero transmission are recovered as the frequency approaches the cut-off value for the incident mode. Finally, the solution is validated against a numerical computation of the diffraction problem via the Boundary Algebraic Equations method with a tailored lattice Green's function.</description>

      <title>A novel stochastic approach of thermalization and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermalization and symmetry-breaking in a nonlinear stochastic Klein-Gordon equation on a spatial lattice, taking into account damping, nonlinear interaction, and stochastic forcing terms reduced by a perturbative solution based on retarded Green functions and the principle of Duhamel to establish a series expansion with the coupling constant. The obtained expressions have a visual representation in the form of rooted trees and Feynman-type diagrams, where their structural pattern will explain the combinatorial factors involved in the expansion. These representations offer a novel application and interpretation specifically tailored for the secondorder, damped Klein-Gordon setting, enabling more complex causal relationships to be explicitly modeled compared to first-order stochastic approaches, thus marking a technical innovation in diagrammatic expansions for such systems. The model takes into account both the initial data from a deterministic approach as well as stochastic sources, for instance, Gaussian noise. Simulations have been performed symmetry-breaking regime to show the relaxation towards stationary states and the symmetry-broken patterns.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: The first order expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous derivation of the first order expansion of the motion of a charged particle in a strong magnetic field. In contrast to the derivations that can be found in the physics literature we solely assume throughout that the magnetic field is strong. In particular we do not need to make any structural assumptions on the particle motion, such as the gyroradius being small in comparison to the magnetic length scale. Instead, some of the additional assumptions which are usually made in the physics literature turn out to be an a posteriori consequence in our approach. Our approach further justifies the utilisation of the guiding centre approximation at "bounce points" within magnetic mirrors, a situation which violates the usual assumptions which are made in the physics literature when deriving the guiding centre approximation.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of Hamiltonian systems via Poisson \texorpdfstring{\cinf}{cinf}-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the exact integration of Hamiltonian systems based on an ordered family of functions whose Poisson brackets close in a triangular way. In contrast with Liouville--Arnold integrability and noncommutative variants, the functions entering this closure need not be first integrals. The triangular Poisson relations instead generate a \cinf-structure on phase space, given by the Hamiltonian vector fields of the family, and this structure can be exploited algorithmically. We show that the equations of motion can be reduced to and solved by a finite sequence of completely integrable Pfaffian equations. We call the resulting geometric object a Poisson \cinf-structure and provide a systematic Pfaffian integration procedure that applies even when a complete set of conserved quantities is unavailable. The construction is illustrated on two models of physical interest: the two-particle non-periodic Toda lattice and the multi-waterbag reduction of the Vlasov equation. Also, we discuss how the theory extends to time-dependent Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Waves and the K-Condition in Viscoelastic Solids and Non-Newtonian Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The K-condition introduced by Shizuta and Kawashima provides a sufficient criterion for the global existence of smooth solutions to dissipative hyperbolic systems. For genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, a weaker K-condition becomes necessary, although not sufficient. In this paper, we analyze this weaker K-condition through the study of acceleration waves propagating in an equilibrium state. We investigate two classes of hyperbolic models: one describing viscoelasticity with linear dissipation, and the other non-Newtonian fluids asymptotically converging to a power-law behavior. For viscoelastic models, the weaker K-condition is always satisfied and acceleration waves remain bounded. For non-Newtonian fluids, the validity of the condition depends on the power-law index $m$: it holds for Newtonian fluids ($m=1$), is violated for shear-thinning fluids ($m&lt;1$), and leads to an instantaneous regularization of acceleration waves for shear-thickening fluids ($m&gt;1$).</description>

      <title>Discrete equations from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper discrete equations are derived from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, including a new discrete equation which has ternary symmetry. There are two classes of rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, one expressed in terms of the generalised Laguerre polynomials and the other in terms of the generalised Umemura polynomials, both of which can be expressed as Wronskians of Laguerre polynomials. Hierarchies of rational solutions of the discrete equations are derived in terms of the generalised Laguerre and generalised Umemura polynomials. It is known that there is nonuniqueness of some rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation. Pairs of nonunique rational solutions are used to derive distinct hierarchies of rational solutions which satisfy the same discrete equation.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the potential energy for different equilibrium configurations of symmetric and asymmetric floating drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a numerical method for computing solutions to a free boundary problem arising from the equilibrium state of a floating drop. This numerical method is based on a Newton's method for the underlying nonlinear boundary value problems, and at each iterative step a Chebyshev spectral collocation method is employed. The problems considered here are those that can be described by using generating curves, and include problems in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  The resulting nine-dimensional space of physical parameters is explored, and examples are given that highlight the potential energy of centrally located drops, wall-bound drops, and asymmetrical configurations in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Non-uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations is displayed, and also strong evidence of non-uniqueness of energy minimizers is given.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative approach to correlation functions and polyspectra of locally non-Gaussian fields and develop a simple semi-perturbative framework that does not rely on the local expansion. As an example, we apply it to locally non-Gaussian fields possessing exponential tails and derive some exact analytic results in the strongly non-Gaussian limit.</description>

      <title>The delocalization of eigenvectors of real elliptic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate delocalization phenomena for eigenvectors of real random matrices that are invariant by orthogonal transformations. A specific phenomenon with these ensembles is that an eigenvector is typically more localized when its eigenvalue is closer to the real axis while for unitarily invariant ensembles, all eigenvectors are delocalized at the same level. More precisely, we measure the delocalization level of a vector $x\in \mathbb{C}^N$ using the Inverse Participation Ratio $\mathrm{IPR}(x) = N|x|_4^4 / |x|_2^4 \geqslant 1$. A higher IPR means a more localized vector. Using the exact distribution of the Schur decomposition of some paradigmatic rotation-invariant matrix models, we prove that conditionally on having an eigenvalue $\lambda$ with $|\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda)| = y / \sqrt{N}$, the IPR of the associated eigenvector converges in distribution towards a random variable $\ell_y$ with an explicit density depending only on $y$. We then prove that $\ell_y \to 3$ when $y \to 0$ and $\ell_y \to 2$ when $y\to +\infty$, coherently with the observed phenomenon.
  This result is explicitly proved for higher-order IPRs and for the real Elliptic Ginibre ensemble at every non-symmetry parameter $\tau \in [0,1[$, including the classical real Ginibre ensemble ($\tau=0$).</description>

      <title>Uncertainty and Wigner negativity in Hilbert-space classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical mechanics, in the Koopman-von Neumann formulation, is described in Hilbert space. It is shown here that classical canonical transformations are generated by Hermitian operators that are in general noncommutative. This naturally brings about uncertainty relations inherent in classical mechanics, for example between position and the generator of space translations, between momentum and the generator of momentum translations, and between dynamical time and the Liouvillian, to name a few. Further, it is shown that the Wigner representation produces a quasi-probability distribution that can take on negative values. Thus, two of the hallmark features of quantum mechanics are reproduced, and become apparent, in a Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Domain Knowledge Guided Bayesian Optimization For Autonomous Alignment Of Complex Scientific Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative $L_p$-differentiability and trace formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\cM$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful semifinite trace $\tau$, and let $L_p(\cM)$ denote the associated noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Let $n\in\N$ and let $a, b$ be self-adjoint operators affiliated with $\cM$, with $b\in L_p(\cM)\cap L_{np}(\cM)$. For a function $f\in C^n(\R)$ whose derivatives $f^{(k)}$ are bounded for $1\le k\le n$, we prove that the map $\phi:t\in\R\mapsto f(a+tb)-f(a)$ is $n$-times differentiable in the $\|\cdot\|_{L_p}$-norm. This strengthens the corresponding result of de Pagter and Sukochev for $p\neq 2$ and extends it to higher-order derivatives. In addition, if $b\in \cM$, then $\phi^{(n)}$ is continuous on $\R$. Consequently, we extend the Potapov--Skripka--Sukochev higher-order trace formula from bounded $L_n(\cM)$-perturbations to not necessarily bounded perturbations in $L_n(\cM)\cap L_{n(n+1)}(\cM)$. Moreover, we show that this trace formula holds for a broader class of admissible functions than the classes previously considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>A QFT information protocol for charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization for the quantum information retrieval protocol recently illustrated by Verlinde and van der Heijden for evaporating black holes is provided to inclusions of type III von Neumann factors. The physical interest of such scenario arises in Quantum Field Theory, where local algebras are type III von Neumann algebras. The formula obtained can be easily interpreted in terms of the statistical dimension of superselection sectors in the case of black holes undergoing charge evaporation, thanks to the index-statistics theorem, leading to a thermodynamic interpretation. A constraint on the values of the index leads to a final remark about the quantization of the charge emitted by the black hole during the evaporation process.</description>

Abstract: We propose the notion of countable decomposability of maps on C*-algebras: a bounded linear map $\varphi : \mathscr{A}\to B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathscr{A}$ is a C*-algebra and $\mathcal{H}$ a Hilbert space, will be called countably decomposable if it admits a representation $\varphi = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \psi_k \circ \phi_k$ for completely positive maps $\psi_k : \mathscr{A}\to B(\mathcal{H})$ and bounded *-maps $\phi_k : \mathscr{A}\to\mathscr{A}$. A characterization of countable decomposability is given in certain cases with various assumptions imposed on maps $\phi_k$. Our findings provide extensions of a classical result of St{\o}rmer from Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 86 (1982), 402-404, originally formulated for decomposable positive maps.</description>

      <title>Factorised stationary states for a long range misanthrope process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The misanthrope process is an interacting particle system where particles move between neighbouring sites with hop rates depending only on the number of particles at the departure and arrival sites. Motivated by a discretised version of the Hammersley--Aldous--Diaconis process, we introduce a partially asymmetric long range misanthrope process (PALRMP) on a finite one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions where particles can move between sites that are not necessarily neighbours, as long as there are no particles in between the departure and arrival sites. In this model, each site $\ell$ has an inhomogeneous rate parameter $x_\ell$ associated to it, and the hop rate of a particle moving from site $k$ to site $\ell$ depends upon the parameter associated to the target site $x_\ell$, the direction the particle moves, and the number of particles at sites $k$ and $\ell$. We also consider the homogeneous PALRMP, where all the $x_\ell$'s are 1. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the hop rates under which the stationary distribution is of factorised form for both the PALRMP and the homogeneous PALRMP, as well as the extreme variants, namely the ones where the particle motion is totally asymmetric (TALRMP) and symmetric (SLRMP). As an illustrative example, we study in detail the discrete Hammersley--Aldous--Diaconis process.</description>

      <title>Critical Reynolds Number as a Topological Phase Transition in Adaptive Fractional Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that models the laminar-turbulent transition as a topological change in the dissipative operator. The order s of the fractional Laplacian is promoted from a fixed parameter to a dynamic field, governed by a variational principle that minimizes a regularized free-energy functional. This adaptive formulation continuously interpolates between the local, viscous dissipation of the Navier-Stokes equations and the non-local, anomalous dissipation characteristic of the inertial range in Kolmogorov turbulence. From this framework, we derive an analytical expression for the critical Reynolds number, Rec, by establishing a spectral balance condition where the effective dissipative capacity of the laminar operator is saturated.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Riemannian positive mass theorem for asymptotically flat spin manifolds with hypersurface singularities. Unlike earlier results, some components of the singular set may be mean-concave, provided that other components of the singular set are sufficiently mean-convex. Our proof uses initial data sets where a suitably chosen second fundamental form transfers convexity defects between different singularity components.</description>

      <title>Correlators in the theory of Integral Discriminants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integral discriminants provide a simple and fundamental model for non-Gaussian integrals, associated with homogeneous polynomials of degree r in n variables. We argue that, in this context, the study of correlators is equally if not more important. In this paper, we study a natural class of correlators in this model -- the invariant correlators. We suggest a general method to compute invariant correlators using differential operators that act on the partition function. This method allows to compute general invariant correlators in terms of the fundamental invariants. Moreover, in some cases the correlators appear to be simply polynomials in the invariants. This could be an interesting manifestation of superintegrability phenomenon in the theory of integral discriminants.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study deformation quantization of symplectic vector fields \`a la Fedosov. We show that each symplectic vector field can be quantized to a derivation of the deformed star algebra. Moreover, we show that this quantization yields a non-abelian $2$-cocycle on the Lie algebra of symplectic vector fields with values in the deformed star algebra. Therefore, we can quantize any Lie algebra action by symplectic vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study first-order phase transitions in continuum Gibbs point processes with saturated interactions. These interactions form a broad class of Hamiltonians in which the local energy in regions of high particle density depends only on the number of points. Building on ideas of Pirogov-Sinai-Zahradnik theory and its adaptations to the continuum, we develop a general method for establishing the existence of two distinct infinite-volume Gibbs measures with different intensities in this setting, demonstrating a first-order phase transition. Our approach extends previous results obtained for the Quermass model and applies in particular to a new class of diluted pairwise interactions introduced in this work.</description>

Abstract: We consider an electrostatic system whose spatial factor is conformal to an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We provide a complete characterization of the most general ansatz, thereby reducing the associated electrostatic system of partial differential equations to an ordinary differential equation system. We prove that there are only two possibilities: either the cosmological constant is nonzero, in which case the solutions are necessarily invariant under rotations or translations, or the cosmological constant vanishes, and the solutions belong to the Majumdar-Papapetrou class with a degree of freedom associated with an invariant $(n-1)$-dimensional subgroup. As a result, we introduce a new solution to the electrovacuum system in the Majumdar-Papapetrou class that is invariant under an $(n-1)$-dimensional group of dilations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry transformation group arising from the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kepler problem in classical mechanics exhibits a rich structure of conserved quantities, highlighted by the Laplace--Runge--Lenz (LRL) vector. Through Noether's theorem in reverse, the LRL vector gives rise to a corresponding infinitesimal dynamical symmetry on the kinematical variables, which is well known in the literature. However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations. As a by-product, the action of the new infinitesimal symmetries on all of the conserved quanties is obtained. The results are given in terms of the physical kinematical variables in the Kepler problem, rather than in an enlarged auxiliary space in which the LRL symmetries are usually stated.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Gibbs measure for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb T$, that was introduced in a seminal paper by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). We show that in the large torus limit, the measure exhibits a phase transition, depending on the size of the nonlinearity. This phase transition was originally conjectured on the basis of numerical simulation by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). Its existence is however striking in view of a series of negative results by McKean (1995) and Rider (2002).</description>

Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Using bidifferential calculus, we derive a vectorial binary Darboux transformation for an integrable matrix version of the first negative flow of the Kaup-Newell hierarchy. A reduction from the latter system to an integrable matrix version of the Fokas-Lenells equation is then shown to inherit a corresponding vectorial Darboux transformation. Matrix soliton solutions are derived from the trivial seed solution. Furthermore, the Darboux transformation is exploited to determine in a systematic way exact solutions of the two-component vector Fokas-Lenells equation on a plane wave background. This comprises breathers, dark solitons, rogue waves and "beating solitons".</description>

      <title>Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l{+}1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l{-}2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l{+}1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l{-}1)$ dimensions. We further prove that the QCAs in $3$ spatial dimensions constructed via TQFTs and ISAs are equivalent by identifying their boundary algebras, and show that this approach extends to higher dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of Planar Central Configurations in the $N$-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degeneracy of central configurations in the planar $N$-body problem makes their enumeration problem hard and the related dynamics appealing. To truly understand the bifurcations of central configurations, we should work in the FULL configuration space which also facilitates the computer-aided methods. The degeneracy is always intertwined with the symmetry of the system of central configurations which makes the problem subtle. By analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system, we systematically explore the direct method to single out trivial zero eigenvalues associated with translational, rotational and scaling symmetries, thereby isolating the non-trivial part of the Jacobian to study the degeneracy. Four distinct formulations of degeneracy are presented, each tailored to handle different forms of the system appeared in the literature. The method is applied to such well-known examples as Lagrange's equilateral triangle solutions for arbitrary masses, the square configuration for four equal masses and the equilateral triangle with a central mass revealing specific mass values for which degeneracy occurs. Combining with the interval algorithm, the nondegeneracy of rhombus central configurations for arbitrary mass is also established.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide an introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with more recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <title>Universal TT- and TQ-relations via centrally extended q-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, and show that spin-j K-operators constructed in arXiv:2301.00781 act as K-matrices previously obtained in the literature. Using these K-operators and K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all local conserved quantities in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators showing non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. For diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra. We finally discuss implications of our results for generalized Gibbs ensemble construction.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of critical FK-decorated random planar maps with $q=4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first scaling limit for FK($q$)-weighted planar maps in the critical case $q=4$, resolving a problem that has remained open since Sheffield's seminal work arXiv:1108.2241. In that work, Sheffield proved a scaling limit for $q&lt;4$ via the celebrated hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, which initiated the peanosphere (mating-of-trees) approach to Liouville quantum gravity. We prove that, at criticality, the associated burger count $\mathcal{S}$ and discrepancy $\mathcal{D}$ satisfy \[ \left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\log(n)}{{2\pi }\sqrt{n}} \mathcal{D}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \stackrel{\text{d}}{\longrightarrow} (B^1_t, B^2_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}, \] where $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent two-sided Brownian motions. To the best of our knowledge, no conjecture for the correct discrepancy scaling factor had previously been formulated. Matching the limiting process with the critical mating of trees arXiv:2109.00275, we establish the first rigorous planar map convergence towards CLE$_4$ and critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity, in the peanosphere sense. Our proof is based on a novel approach that reveals the exactly solvable nature of the model through a correspondence with the (bicoloured) fully packed loop-$O(2)$ model on triangulations, and yields critical geometric exponents matching the predictions of conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>On theta function expressions of cyclic products of fermion correlation functions in genus two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2211.09069, significant progress was made in decomposing simple products of fermion correlation functions, and in summing over spin structures of superstring amplitudes in genus two under cyclic constraints. In this manuscript we consider part of the same subject using a framework in which one of the branch points of the genus two curve is fixed at infinity. This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product. Consequently, the trilinear relations found in arXiv:2211.09069 can be derived from the known set of differential equations of genus two Pe-functions by simply setting the variables equal to the half-periods of the non-singular and even spin structures, as is the case for genus one. The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text. We present some general results and demonstrate that concrete expressions of both the spin structure dependent and independent parts will be derived and simplified to analyze using the logic of the derivations of the classical solutions to Jacobi inversion problem and their modifications which will be given in this manuscript.</description>

      <title>Magnetic spectral inverse problems on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish positive results for two spectral inverse problems in the presence of a magnetic potential. Exploiting the principal wave trace invariants, we first observe that on closed Anosov manifolds with simple length spectrum, one can recover an electric and a magnetic (up to a natural gauge) potential from the spectrum of the associated magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. This simple observation extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Ceki\'c and T$.$Lefeuvre (2023)$.$ Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or magnetic Steklov operator) on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary determines both a magnetic potential (up to gauge) and an electric potential at the boundary, provided the latter is Anosov with simple length spectrum. Under this assumption, one can actually show that the magnetic Steklov spectrum determines the full Taylor series at the boundary of any smooth magnetic field and electric potential. As a simple consequence, in this case, both an analytic magnetic field and an analytic electric potential are uniquely determined by their Steklov spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hidden Kinematics and Dual Quantum References in Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin resonance phenomena are conventionally described using transition probabilities formulated in a rotating frame, whose physical meaning implicitly depends on the choice of quantum reference standard. In this Colloquium, we show that a spin in a rotating magnetic field constitutes a configuration involving two quantum descriptions that share a common quantization operator but differ in their kinematic and dynamical roles. The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Structure Preserving Schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations with Degenerate Mobility and Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system utilizes a diffusive phase-field for interface tracking of multi-phase fluid flows. Recently structure preserving methods for CHNS have moved into focus to construct numerical schemes that, for example, are mass conservative or obey initial bounds of the phase-field variable. In this work decoupled implicit-explicit formulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methodology are considered and compared to existing schemes from the literature.
  For the fluid flow a standard continuous Galerkin approach is applied. An adaptive conforming grid is utilized to further draw computational focus on the interface regions, while coarser meshes are utilized around pure phases. All presented methods are compared against each other in terms of bound preservation, mass conservation, and energy dissipation for different examples found in the literature, including a classical rising droplet problem.</description>
