      <title>Higher Segal spaces and partial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-Segal conditions of Dyckerhoff and Kapranov are exactness properties for simplicial objects based on the geometry of cyclic polytopes in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. 2-Segal spaces are also known as decomposition spaces, and most activity has focused on this case. We study the interplay of these conditions with the partial groups of Chermak, a class of symmetric simplicial sets. The $d$-Segal conditions simplify for symmetric simplicial objects, and take a particularly explicit form for partial groups. We show partial groups provide a rich class of $d$-Segal sets for $d &gt; 2$, by undertaking a systematic study of the "degree" of a partial group $X$, namely the smallest $k\geq 1$ such that $X$ is $2k$-Segal. We develop effective tools to explicitly compute the degree based on the discrete geometry of actions of partial groups, which we define and study. Applying these tools involves solving Helly-type problems for abstract closure spaces. We carry out degree computations in concrete settings, including for the punctured Weyl groups introduced here, where we find that the degree is closely related to the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra of the associated semisimple Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Structural and rigidity properties of Lie skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structural and rigidity properties of \emph{Lie skew braces} (LSBs), objects essentially known in the literature as \emph{post--Lie groups}, obtained by endowing a manifold with two compatible group laws that share the same identity element. LSBs extend skew left braces, which are central to the study of non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, to the smooth category. Our first main result shows that, for every connected LSB $(G,\cdot,\circ)$, linearity (in the simply-connected case) and solvability carry over from $(G,\cdot)$ to $(G,\circ)$, whereas the converse direction is rigid: if $(G,\circ)$ is nilpotent (respectively, semisimple) then $(G,\cdot)$ is forced to be solvable (respectively, isomorphic to $(G,\circ)$). Our second results provides two ``flexibility'' statements: every non-linear simply connected Lie group \((G, \cdot )\) admits an LSB \((G,\cdot,\circ)\) such that \((G,\circ)\) is linear, and every simply connected solvable Lie group \((G, \circ )\) supports a LSB \((G,\cdot,\circ)\) such that \((G,\cdot)\) is nilpotent. A third result provides a complete existence table for non-trivial LSBs across the six standard Lie-group classes, abelian, nilpotent (non-abelian), solvable (non-nilpotent), simple, semisimple (non-simple) and mixed type, identifying precisely when a LSB can be built and when only the trivial or no structure occurs. Both the explicit constructions and the properties established in our theorems rely on a factorisation technique for Lie groups, on the correspondence between LSBs and regular subgroups of the affine group $\operatorname{Aff}(G,\cdot)$, which renders LSB theory equivalent to simply transitive affine actions, and on the theory of post-Lie algebras together with their integrability properties.</description>

      <title>Dense and comeager conjugacy classes in zero-dimensional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group. We consider the Polish space of all actions of $G$ on the Cantor space by homeomorphisms and study the existence of a comeager conjugacy class in this space and some natural subspaces. We also develop a general model-theoretic framework to study this and related questions.
  We prove that for a finitely generated free group, there is a comeager conjugacy class in the space of minimal actions, as well as in the space of minimal, probability measure-preserving actions. We also identify the two classes: the first one is the Fra\"iss\'e limit of all sofic minimal subshifts and the second, the universal profinite action. In the opposite direction, if $G$ is an amenable group which is not finitely generated, we show that there is no comeager conjugacy class in the space of all actions and if $G$ is locally finite, also in the space of minimal actions.
  Finally, we study the question of existence of a dense conjugacy class in the space of topologically transitive actions. We show that if $G$ is free or virtually polycyclic, then such a dense conjugacy class exists iff $G$ is virtually cyclic.</description>

      <title>Presentations for semigroups of full-domain partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full-domain partition monoid $P_n^{fd}$ has been discovered independently in two recent studies on connections between diagram monoids and category theory. It is a right restriction Ehresmann monoid, and contains both the full transformation monoid and the join semilattice of equivalence relations. In this paper we give presentations (by generators and relations) for $P_n^{fd}$, its singular ideal, and its planar submonoid. The latter is not an Ehresmann submonoid, but it is a so-called grrac monoid in the terminology of Branco, Gomes and Gould. In particular, its structure is determined in part by a right regular band in one-one correspondence with planar equivalences.</description>

      <title>Mixed states for reference frames transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</description>

      <title>Higher Kazhdan projections and delocalized $\ell^2$-Betti numbers for an amalgamated product group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit expressions for the $K$-theory classes of higher Kazhdan projections for amalgamated product groups $\mathbb{Z}_m*_{\mathbb{Z}_d}\mathbb{Z}_n$. Our approach follows the methodology developed by Pooya and Wang for free product groups $\mathbb{Z}_m*\mathbb{Z}_n$, and naturally generalizes their results on free products. As an application of the $K$-class expressions, we obtain non-vanishing results for delocalized $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Problems on Graphs Defined on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of graph problems on graphs defined on groups, especially power graphs. We observe that an isomorphism invariant problem, such as Hamiltonian Path, Partition into Cliques, Feedback Vertex Set, Subgraph Isomorphism, cannot be NP-complete for power graphs, commuting graphs, enhanced power graphs, directed power graphs, and bounded-degree Cayley graphs, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). An analogous result holds for isomorphism invariant group problems: no such problem can be NP-complete unless ETH is false. We show that the Weighted Max-Cut problem is NP-complete in power graphs. We also show that, unless ETH is false, the Graph Motif problem cannot be solved in quasipolynomial time on power graphs, even for power graphs of cyclic groups. We study the recognition problem of power graphs when the adjacency matrix or list is given as input and show that for abelian groups and some classes of nilpotent groups, it is solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Invariants that are covering spaces and their Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper by the author a universal ring of invariants for algebraic structures of a given type was constructed. This ring is a polynomial algebra that is generated by certain trace diagrams. It was shown that this ring admits the structure of a rational positive self adjoint Hopf algebra (abbreviated rational PSH-algebra), and was conjectured that it always admits a lattice that is a PSH-algebra, a structure that was introduced by Zelevinsky. In this paper we answer this conjecture, showing that the universal ring of invariants splits as the tensor product of rational PSH-algebras that are either polynomial algebras in a single variable, or admit a lattice that is a PSH-algebra. We do so by considering diagrams as topological spaces, and using tools from the theory of covering spaces. As an application we derive a formula that connects Kronecker coefficients with finite index subgroups of free groups and representations of their Weyl groups, and a formula for the number of conjugacy classes of finite index subgroup in a finitely generated group that admits a surjective homomorphism onto the group of integers.</description>

      <title>Making Non-Negative Polynomials into Sums of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate linear operators $A:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. We give explicit operators $A$ such that, for fixed $d\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)_{\leq 2d}\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{\leq d}^2$. We give an explicit operator $A$ such that $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(\mathbb{R}^n)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. For $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, we give a condition such that $A$ exists with $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. We show that, for compact $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, there is no bijective linear operator $T:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with $T\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. In the framework of regular Fr\'echet Lie groups and Lie algebras we investigate the linear operators $A$ such that $e^{tA}:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is well-defined for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. We give a three-line-proof of Stochel's Theorem.</description>
