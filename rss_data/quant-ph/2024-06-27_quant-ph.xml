      <title>Probing many-body Bell correlation depth with superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality describes a stronger form of quantum correlation than that of entanglement. It refutes Einstein's belief of local realism and is among the most distinctive and enigmatic features of quantum mechanics. It is a crucial resource for achieving quantum advantages in a variety of practical applications, ranging from cryptography and certified random number generation via self-testing to machine learning. Nevertheless, the detection of nonlocality, especially in quantum many-body systems, is notoriously challenging. Here, we report an experimental certification of genuine multipartite Bell correlations, which signal nonlocality in quantum many-body systems, up to 24 qubits with a fully programmable superconducting quantum processor. In particular, we employ energy as a Bell correlation witness and variationally decrease the energy of a many-body system across a hierarchy of thresholds, below which an increasing Bell correlation depth can be certified from experimental data. As an illustrating example, we variationally prepare the low-energy state of a two-dimensional honeycomb model with 73 qubits and certify its Bell correlations by measuring an energy that surpasses the corresponding classical bound with up to 48 standard deviations. In addition, we variationally prepare a sequence of low-energy states and certify their genuine multipartite Bell correlations up to 24 qubits via energies measured efficiently by parity oscillation and multiple quantum coherence techniques. Our results establish a viable approach for preparing and certifying multipartite Bell correlations, which provide not only a finer benchmark beyond entanglement for quantum devices, but also a valuable guide towards exploiting multipartite Bell correlation in a wide spectrum of practical applications.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Effects on Entangled Single-Electron Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of individual charged particles has been deeply explored in physics's theoretical and experimental domains during the past decades. It is the pillar of several existing devices used for metrology and sensing and is a promising platform for realizing future technologies, such as quantum computers. It is also known that in the relativistic regime, interactions between charged particles become affected by post-Coulombian corrections, with the dominant couplings encoded in the Darwin Hamiltonian. The Darwin term has been extensively studied in atomic physics, where the interaction range is confined to the sub-angstrom scale. Still, there is a lack of understanding about whether (and when) Darwin's contributions are relevant at larger scales. In this paper, we explore the effects of these corrections in a system of two harmonically trapped electrons, where we look into the behaviour of quantum entanglement present in the static and dynamical regimes. We explore the parameter space of the developed model and seek frequencies, distances, and squeezing parameters for which relativistic effects become relevant for the generation of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of dynamics of disordered quantum ensembles and semi-infinite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for mapping the exact dynamics of an ensemble of disordered quantum systems onto the dynamics of a single particle propagating along a semi-infinite lattice, with parameters determined by the probability distribution of disorder realizations of the original heterogeneous quantum ensemble. This mapping provides a geometric interpretation on the loss of coherence when averaging over the ensemble and allows computation of the exact dynamics of the entire disordered ensemble in a single simulation. Alternatively, by exploiting the reverse map, one can obtain lattice dynamics by averaging over realisations of disorder. The potential of this equivalence is showcased with examples of the map in both directions: obtaining dephasing of a qubit via mapping to a lattice model, and solving a simple lattice model via taking an average over realizations of disorder of a unit cell.</description>

      <title>Using a Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm to Analyze the Critical Properties of the ANNNI Model Without Classical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of the Anisotropic Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model using a feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON). This approach allows us to compute both ground and excited states without relying on classical optimization methods. We study the quantum phase transitions using the Finite Size Scaling method, analyze correlation functions through spin correlations in the ground state, and examine magnetic structure by calculating structure factors via the Discrete Fourier Transform. Our results demonstrate the algorithm's capability to identify quantum phase transitions and efficiently map the ANNNI model's magnetic phases, establishing FALQON as a powerful tool to study complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Managing Classical Processing Requirements for Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction requires decoders to process syndromes generated by the error-correction circuits. These decoders must process syndromes faster than they are being generated to prevent a backlog of undecoded syndromes that can exponentially increase the memory and time required to execute the program. This has resulted in the development of fast hardware decoders that accelerate decoding. Applications utilizing error-corrected quantum computers will require hundreds to thousands of logical qubits and provisioning a hardware decoder for every logical qubit can be very costly. In this work, we present a framework to reduce the number of hardware decoders and navigate the compute-memory trade-offs without sacrificing the performance or reliability of program execution. Through workload-centric characterizations, we propose efficient decoder scheduling policies which can reduce the number of hardware decoders required to run a program by up to 10x while consuming less than 100 MB of memory.</description>

      <title>Entangling Schr\"odinger's cat states by seeding a Bell state or swapping the cats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information processing, two primary research directions have emerged: one based on discrete variables (DV) and the other on the structure of quantum states in a continuous-variable (CV) space. It is increasingly recognized that integrating these two approaches could unlock new potentials, overcoming the inherent limitations of each. Here, we show that such a DV-CV hybrid approach, applied to superconducting Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), enables us to entangle a pair of Schr\"odinger's cat states by two straightforward methods. The first method involves the entanglement-preserving and deterministic conversion between Bell states in the Fock-state basis (DV encoding) and those in the cat-state basis (CV encoding). This method would allow us to construct quantum networks in the cat-state basis using conventional schemes originally developed for the Fock-state basis. In the second method, the $\sqrt{\textrm{iSWAP}}$ gate operation is implemented between two cat states following the procedure used for Fock-state encoding. This DV-like gate operation on CV encoding not only completes the demonstration of a universal quantum gate set in a KPO system but also enables faster and simpler gate operations compared to previous SWAP gate implementations on bosonic modes. Our work offers a simple yet powerful application of DV-CV hybridization while also highlighting the scalability of this planar KPO system.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of quantum state transport in one-dimensional topological chain under nonadiabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a system is driven across a continuous phase transition, the density of topological defects demonstrates a power-law scaling behavior versus the quenching rate, as predicted by Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In this study, we generalized this idea and address the scaling of quantum state transport in a one-dimensional topological system subject to a linear drive through its topological quantum phase transition point. We illustrate the power-law dependencies of the quantum state's transport distance, width, and peak magnitude on the driving velocity. Crucially, the power-law exponents are distinct for the edge state and bulk state. Our results offer a novel perspective on quantum state transfer and enriches the field of Kibble-Zurek behaviors and nonadiabatic quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unified Architecture for a Quantum Lookup Table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum access to arbitrary classical data encoded in unitary black-box oracles underlies interesting data-intensive quantum algorithms, such as machine learning or electronic structure simulation. The feasibility of these applications depends crucially on gate-efficient implementations of these oracles, which are commonly some reversible versions of the boolean circuit for a classical lookup table. We present a general parameterized architecture for quantum circuits implementing a lookup table that encompasses all prior work in realizing a continuum of optimal tradeoffs between qubits, non-Clifford gates, and error resilience, up to logarithmic factors. Our architecture assumes only local 2D connectivity, yet recovers results that previously required all-to-all connectivity, particularly, with the appropriate parameters, poly-logarithmic error scaling. We also identify novel regimes, such as simultaneous sublinear scaling in all parameters. These results enable tailoring implementations of the commonly used lookup table primitive to any given quantum device with constrained resources.</description>

      <title>Operating Single-Photon Circulator by Spinning Optical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A circulator is one of the crucial devices in quantum networks and simulations. We propose a four-port circulator that regulate the flow of single photons at muti-frequency points by studying the coherent transmission of a single photon in a coupled system of two resonators and two waveguides. When both resonators are static or rotate at the same angular velocity, single-photon transport demonstrates reciprocity; however, when the angular velocities differ, four distinct frequency points emerge where photon circulation can occur. In particular, when the angular velocities of the two resonators are equal and opposite, there are two different frequency points where photon circulation can be achieved, and there is a frequency point where a single photon input from any waveguide can be completely routed to the other waveguide. Interestingly, by rotating the two resonators, the single-photon circulation suppressed by the internal defect-induced backscattering can be restored.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Gibbs Ensemble as the Unique Steady State in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct unique non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of Lindblad master equation characterized by a Gibbs ensemble $\rho_{\text{NESS}} \propto e^{-\beta \tilde{H}}$, where the effective Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. Specifically, when the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as the unique steady state.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the controversy over the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integral along a path in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In this paper, we try to demonstrate that their cancellation argument would not be justified by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of external electromagnetic potential. At the end, we conclude that the failure of the cancellation argument is due to unjustified application of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem to the problem of time-dependent AB-effect.</description>

      <title>SuperGrad: a differentiable simulator for superconducting processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One significant advantage of superconducting processors is their extensive design flexibility, which encompasses various types of qubits and interactions. Given the large number of tunable parameters of a processor, the ability to perform gradient optimization would be highly beneficial. Efficient backpropagation for gradient computation requires a tightly integrated software library, for which no open-source implementation is currently available. In this work, we introduce SuperGrad, a simulator that accelerates the design of superconducting quantum processors by incorporating gradient computation capabilities. SuperGrad offers a user-friendly interface for constructing Hamiltonians and computing both static and dynamic properties of composite systems. This differentiable simulation is valuable for a range of applications, including optimal control, design optimization, and experimental data fitting. In this paper, we demonstrate these applications through examples and code snippets.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Spectral Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that noisy quantum dynamics exposed to weak measurements exhibit a spectral transition between gapless and gapped phases. To this end, we employ the Lyapunov spectrum obtained through singular values of a non-unitary matrix describing the dynamics. We discover that the gapless and gapped phases respectively correspond to the volume-law and area-law phases of the entanglement entropy for the dominant Lyapunov vector. This correspondence between the spectral gap and the scaling of entanglement offers an intriguing analogy with ground-state phase transitions. We also discuss some crucial differences from ground-state transitions, such as the scaling law of the entanglement and the exponentially small gaps. Furthermore, we show that the spectral transition leads to the transition of the timescale for the memory loss of initial states.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Experimental Imperfections on Photonic GHZ State Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the advantages of photonic quantum computing, including direct compatibility with communication, are apparent, several imperfections such as loss and distinguishability presently limit actual implementations. These imperfections are unlikely to be completely eliminated, and it is therefore beneficial to investigate which of these are the most dominant and what is achievable under their presence. In this work, we provide an in-depth investigation of the influence of photon loss, multi-photon terms and photon distinguishability on the generation of photonic 3-partite GHZ states via established fusion protocols. We simulate the generation process for SPDC and solid-state-based single-photon sources using realistic parameters and show that different types of imperfections are dominant with respect to the fidelity and generation success probability. Our results indicate what are the dominant imperfections for the different photon sources and in which parameter regimes we can hope to implement photonic quantum computing in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy transfer process in the recently proposed sunburst quantum Ising model, which consists of two interacting integrable systems: a transverse Ising chain with a very small transverse field and a finite number of external isolated qubits. We show that in this model of the quantum battery, coupling between the battery and charger can be used to optimize the ergotropy, which is the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery. At the same time, maximum charging power increases with the coupling strength, allowing for the simultaneous optimization of both ergotropy and charging power in the strong coupling limit. Furthermore, we show that both ergotropy and charging power are independent of the initial state of the charger.</description>

      <title>Charge and Spin Dynamics and Destabilization of Shallow Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers under UV and Blue Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer unique opportunities for studying photochemical reactions at the single-molecule level, such as the photogeneration of radical pairs in proximal molecules. A prerequesite for such experimental schemes is the detailed understanding of the charge and spin dynamics of NV centers exposed to the short-wavelength light required for photoexciting chemical species. Here, we measure and analyze the charge and spin dynamics of shallow NV centers under 445 nm (blue) and 375 nm (UV) illumination. With blue excitation, we observe a power-dependent charge-state preparation accompanied by modest preservation of spin initialization fidelity. Under UV excitation, we find a power-independent charge-state preparation and no spin polarization. We further observe an irreversible aging of NV centers under prolonged exposure to UV, and to a lesser extent, blue laser excitation, which we attribute to formation of new electronic trap states. This aging manifests itself in a reduced charge stability and spin contrast, and is detrimental to the NV sensing performance. We evaluate the prospects and limitations of NV centers for probing photogenerated radical pairs based on experimentally measured sensitivities following blue and UV excitation, and outline the design rules for possible sensing schemes.</description>

They can be used to investigate the existence of quantum error-correcting codes and $k$-uniform states. In this work, we build the connection between quantum weight enumerators and the $n$-qubit parallelized SWAP test. We discover that each shadow enumerator corresponds precisely to a probability in the $n$-qubit parallelized SWAP test, providing a computable and operational meaning for the shadow enumerators. Due to the non-negativity of probabilities, we obtain an elegant proof for the shadow inequalities. Concurrently, we can also calculate the Shor-Laflamme enumerators and the Rains unitary enumerators from the $n$-qubit parallelized SWAP test. For applications, we employ the $n$-qubit parallelized SWAP test to determine the distances of quantum error-correcting codes, and the $k$-uniformity of pure states. Our results indicate that quantum weight enumerators can be efficiently estimated on quantum computers, and opening a path to calculate the distances of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between Gradient Measurement Efficiency and Expressivity in Deep Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) require an efficient training algorithm to achieve practical quantum advantages. A promising approach is the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms, where gradients are estimated through quantum measurements. However, it is generally difficult to efficiently measure gradients in QNNs because the quantum state collapses upon measurement. In this work, we prove a general trade-off between gradient measurement efficiency and expressivity in a wide class of deep QNNs, elucidating the theoretical limits and possibilities of efficient gradient estimation. This trade-off implies that a more expressive QNN requires a higher measurement cost in gradient estimation, whereas we can increase gradient measurement efficiency by reducing the QNN expressivity to suit a given task. We further propose a general QNN ansatz called the stabilizer-logical product ansatz (SLPA), which can reach the upper limit of the trade-off inequality by leveraging the symmetric structure of the quantum circuit. In learning an unknown symmetric function, the SLPA drastically reduces the quantum resources required for training while maintaining accuracy and trainability compared to a well-designed symmetric circuit based on the parameter-shift method. Our results not only reveal a theoretical understanding of efficient training in QNNs but also provide a standard and broadly applicable efficient QNN design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors capitalize on advanced control sequences for maximizing sensitivity and precision. However, protocols are not usually optimized for temporal resolution. Here, we establish the limits for time-resolved sensing of dynamical signals using qubit probes. We show that the best possible time resolution is closely related to the quantum speed limit (QSL), which describes the minimum time needed to transform between basis states. We further show that a bipartite control sequence consisting of two phase-shifted pulses reaches the QSL. Practical implementation is discussed based on the example of the spin-1 qutrit of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in the spectra of non-Hermitian operators, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. Recently, open quantum systems have been increasingly explored as EP testbeds due to their natural non-Hermitian nature. However, existing works mostly focus on the Markovian limit, leaving a gap in understanding EPs in the non-Markovian regime. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a theoretical framework based on two numerically exact descriptions of non-Markovian dynamics: the pseudomode mapping and the hierarchical equations of motion. The proposed framework enables conventional spectral analysis for EP identification, establishing direct links between EPs and dynamic manifestations in open systems, such as non-exponential decays and enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. We unveil pure non-Markovian EPs that are unobservable in the Markovian limit. Remarkably, the EP aligns with the Markovian-to-non-Markovian transition, and the EP condition is adjustable by modifying environmental spectral properties. Moreover, we show that structured environments can elevate EP order, thereby enhancing the system's sensitivity. These findings lay a theoretical foundation and open new avenues for non-Markovian reservoir engineering and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Learning pure quantum states (almost) without regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum state tomography with minimal regret. A learner has sequential oracle access to an unknown pure quantum state, and in each round selects a pure probe state. Regret is incurred if the unknown state is measured orthogonal to this probe, and the learner's goal is to minimise the expected cumulative regret over $T$ rounds. The challenge is to find a balance between the most informative measurements and measurements incurring minimal regret. We show that the cumulative regret scales as $\Theta(\operatorname{polylog} T)$ using a new tomography algorithm based on a median of means least squares estimator. This algorithm employs measurements biased towards the unknown state and produces online estimates that are optimal (up to logarithmic terms) in the number of observed samples.</description>

      <title>Scaling Quantum Computations via Gate Virtualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM), an end-to-end generic system for scalable execution of large quantum circuits with high fidelity on noisy and small quantum processors (QPUs) by leveraging gate virtualization. QVM exposes a virtual circuit intermediate representation (IR) that extends the notion of quantum circuits to incorporate gate virtualization. Based on the virtual circuit as our IR, we propose the QVM compiler - an extensible compiler infrastructure to transpile a virtual circuit through a series of modular optimization passes to produce a set of optimized circuit fragments. Lastly, these transpiled circuit fragments are executed on QPUs using our QVM runtime - a scalable and distributed infrastructure to virtualize and execute circuit fragments on a set of distributed QPUs.
  We evaluate QVM on IBM's 7- and 27-qubit QPUs. Our evaluation shows that using our system, we can scale the circuit sizes executable on QPUs up to double the size of the QPU while improving fidelity by 4.7$\times$ on average compared to larger QPUs and that we can effectively reduce circuit depths to only 40\% of the original circuit depths.</description>

      <title>Isospectrally Patterned Aperiodic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and explore patterned aperiodic lattices consisting of coupled isospectral cells that vary across the lattice. Each resulting band consists of three distinct energy domains with two mobility edges marking the transition from localized to delocalized states and vice versa. The characteristic localization length emerges due to a competition of the involved phase gradient and the coupling between the cells which allows us to understand the localization mechanism and its evolution. The fraction of localized versus delocalized eigenstates can be tuned by changing the gradient between the cells of the lattice. We outline the perspectives of investigation of this novel class of isospectrally patterned aperiodic lattices.</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Near-Term Quantum Spin Simulation of the Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Square $J_{1}-J_{2}$ Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating complex spin systems, particularly those with high degrees of frustration and entanglement, presents significant challenges. These systems often defy traditional simulation techniques due to their complex energy landscapes and entanglement properties. We focus on the $J_{1}-J_{2}$ Heisenberg model, known for its rich phase behavior on the square lattice. The model serves to study magnetic states, including phases that might be linked to high-temperature superconductivity. We carry out 16-qubit experiments on the 127-qubit IBM Rensselear Eagle processor to perform ground state simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, enhanced through classical warm-starting. Our results are qualitatively consistent with established theoretical predictions, underscoring the viability of VQE for ground-state estimation in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. We utilize existing error mitigation strategies, introduce a novel Classically-Reinforced VQE error mitigation scheme, and compare its performance with the Quantum Moments algorithm. Additionally, we explore an experimental implementation of the Quantum Lanczos (QLanczos) algorithm using Variational-Fast Forwarding (VFF) on a 4 qubit site. Our study demonstrates the capability of near-term quantum devices to both identify trends and predict phase transitions within the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Causal Structure and Causal Inequalities with Time-Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry is a prevalent feature of microscopic physics, including operational quantum theory and classical general relativity. Previous works have studied indefinite causal structure using the language of operational quantum theory, however, these rely on time-asymmetric conditions to constrain both operations and the process matrix. Here, we use time-symmetric, operational probabilistic theory to develop a time-symmetric process matrix formalism for indefinite causal structure. This framework allows for more processes than previously considered and a larger set of causal inequalities. We demonstrate that this larger set of causal inequalities offers new opportunities for device-independent certification of causal non-separability by violating new inequalities. Additionally, we determined that the larger class of time-symmetric processes found here is equivalent to those with Indefinite Causal Order and Time Direction (ICOTD) considered by Chiribella and Liu, thereby providing a description of these processes in terms of process matrices.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact solution for the linearized junction array modes of the superconducting qubit fluxonium in the absence of array disorder. This solution holds for arrays of any length and ground capacitance, and for both differential and grounded devices. Array mode energies are determined by roots of convex combinations of Chebyshev polynomials, and their spatial profiles are plane waves. We also provide a simple, approximate solution, which estimates array mode properties over a wide range of circuit parameters, and an accompanying Mathematica file that implements both the exact and approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>On the effectiveness of the collapse in the Di\'osi-Penrose model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that gravity plays a role in the collapse of the quantum wave function has been considered in the literature, and it is of relevance not only because it would provide a solution to the measurement problem in quantum theory, but also because it would give a new and unexpected twist to the search for a unified theory of quantum and gravitational phenomena, possibly overcoming the current impasse. The Di\'osi-Penrose model is the most popular incarnation of this idea. It predicts a progressive breakdown of quantum superpositions when the mass of the system increases; as such, it is susceptible to experimental verification. Current experiments set a lower bound $R_0\gtrsim 4 \times 10^{-10}$ m for the free parameter of the model, excluding some versions of it. In this work we search for an upper bound, coming from the request that the collapse is effective enough to guarantee classicality at the macroscopic scale: we find out that not all macroscopic systems collapse effectively. If one relaxes this request, a reasonable (although to some degree arbitrary) bound is found to be: $R_0\lesssim 10^{-4}$ m. This will serve to better direct future experiments to further test the model.</description>

      <title>Generalized Concentratable Entanglement via Parallelized Permutation Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information theory and technologies, but its quantification has been a persistent challenge. Recently, Concentratable Entanglement (CE) has been introduced as a promising candidate for a multipartite entanglement measure, which can be efficiently estimated across two state copies. In this work, we introduce Generalized Concentratable Entanglement (GCE) measures, highlight a natural correspondence to quantum Tsallis entropies, and conjecture a new entropic inequality that may be of independent interest. We show how to efficiently measure the GCE in a quantum computer, using parallelized permutation tests across a prime number of state copies. We exemplify the practicality of such computation for probabilistic entanglement concentration into W states with three state copies. Moreover, we show that an increased number of state copies provides an improved error bound on this family of multipartite entanglement measures in the presence of imperfections. Finally, we prove that GCE is still a well-defined entanglement monotone as its value, on average, does not increase under local operations and classical communication (LOCC).</description>

      <title>Is the Valence Bond Solid state in $J_1$-$J_2$ Square Lattice Heisenberg Model Plaquette or Columnar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Fully Augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) methods to investigate the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model. To differentiate between the Columnar Valence Bond Solid (CVBS) and Plaquette Valence Bond Solid (PVBS) phases, we introduce an anisotropy $\Delta_y$ in the nearest neighboring coupling in the $y$-direction, aiming at detecting the possible spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. In the calculations, we push the bond dimension to as large as $D = 25000$ in FAMPS, simulating systems at a maximum size of $14 \times 14$. With a careful extrapolation of the truncation errors and appropriate finite-size scaling, followed by finite $\Delta_y$ scaling analysis of the VBS dimer order parameters, we identify the VBS phase as a PVBS type, meaning there is no spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. This study not only resolves the long-standing issue of the characterization of the VBS order in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model but also highlights the capabilities of FAMPS in the study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Interband and intraband transitions, as well as charge mobility in driven two-band model with electron phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interband and intraband transitions are fundamental concepts in the study of electronic properties of materials, particularly semiconductors and nanomaterials. These transitions involve the movement of electrons between distinct energy states or bands within a material. Besides, charge mobility is also a critical parameter in materials science and electronics. A thorough understanding of these transitions and mobility is critical for the development and optimization of advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this study, we investigate the influence of external periodic drivings on interband and intraband transitions, as well as charge mobility, within a driven two-band model that includes electron-phonon coupling. These external periodic drivings can include a periodic laser field, a time-varying magnetic or electric field, or an alternating current (AC) voltage source. We have developed the Floquet surface hopping (FSH) and Floquet mean field (FMF) methods to simulate electronic dynamics under various drivings in both real and reciprocal spaces. Our findings demonstrate that periodic drivings can enhance interband transitions while suppressing intraband transitions. Additionally, charge mobility is restrained by these external periodic drivings in the driven two-band model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a harmonic oscillator (HO) system within the framework of topologically charged Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity space-time. Additionally, we incorporate the Wu-Yang magnetic monopole (WYMM) into the quantum system and analyze the influences of modified gravity, the topological charge, and WYMM on this HO quantum mechanical system. Using analytical methods, we derive the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the HO. Moreover, we consider a scenario where the EiBI-gravity parameter is absent and introduce an inverse square potential, including the WYMM, into the HO system. Our findings show significant deviations in the behavior of the HO system compared to the traditional quantum mechanical HO model, including alterations in the bound-state spectra and eigenfunctions. These results provide valuable insights into the interplay between quantum mechanical problems and alternative gravitational theories.</description>

Abstract: Tensor network algorithms can efficiently simulate complex quantum many-body systems by utilizing knowledge of their structure and entanglement. These methodologies have been adapted recently for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a spectrum of fluid phenomena, from the aerodynamics of vehicles to weather patterns. Within this quantum-inspired paradigm, velocity is encoded as matrix product states (MPS), effectively harnessing the analogy between interscale correlations of fluid dynamics and entanglement in quantum many-body physics. This particular tensor structure is also called quantics tensor train (QTT). By utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum library to perform parallel tensor computations on GPUs, our adaptation speeds up simulations by up to 12.1 times. This allows us to study the algorithm in terms of its applicability, scalability, and performance. By simulating two qualitatively different but commonly encountered 2D flow problems at high Reynolds numbers up to $1\times10^7$ using a fourth-order time stepping scheme, we find that the algorithm has a potential advantage over direct numerical simulations in the turbulent regime as the requirements for grid resolution increase drastically. In addition, we derive the scaling $\chi=\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ for the maximum bond dimension $\chi$ of MPS representing turbulent flow fields, with an error $\epsilon$, based on the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Our findings motivate further exploration of related quantum algorithms and other tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>Protecting coherence from the environment via Stark many-body localization in a Quantum-Dot Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13354v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor platforms are emerging as a promising architecture for storing and processing quantum information, e.g., in quantum dot spin qubits. However, charge noise coming from interactions between the electrons is a major limiting factor, along with the scalability of many qubits, for a quantum computer. We show that a magnetic field gradient can be implemented in a semiconductor quantum dot array to induce a local quantum coherent dynamical $\ell-$bit exhibiting the potential to be used as logical qubits. These dynamical $\ell-$bits are responsible for the model being many-body localized. We show that these dynamical $\ell-$bits and the corresponding many-body localization are protected from all noises, including phonons, for sufficiently long times if electron-phonon interaction is not non-local. We further show the implementation of thermalization-based self-correcting logical gates. This thermalization-based error correction goes beyond the standard paradigm of decoherence-free and noiseless subsystems. Our work thus opens a new venue for passive quantum error correction in semiconductor-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A near-term quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations based on the Woodbury identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of equations have generated excitement because of the potential speed-ups involved and the importance of solving linear equations in many applications. However, applying these algorithms can be challenging. The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and improvements thereof require complex subroutines suitable for fault-tolerant hardware such as Hamiltonian simulation, making it ill-suited to current hardware. Variational algorithms, on the other hand, involve expensive optimization loops, which can be prone to barren plateaus and local optima. We describe a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that avoids these problems. Our algorithm is based on the Woodbury identity, which analytically describes the inverse of a matrix that is a low-rank modification of another (easily-invertible) matrix. This approach only utilizes basic quantum subroutines like the Hadamard test or the swap test, so it is well-suited to current hardware. There is no optimization loop, so barren plateaus and local optima do not present a problem. The low-rank aspect of the identity enables us to efficiently transfer information to and from the quantum computer. This approach can produce accurate results on current hardware. As evidence of this, we estimate an inner product involving the solution of a system of more than 16 million equations with 2% error using IBM's Auckland quantum computer. To our knowledge, no system of equations this large has previously been solved to this level of accuracy on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Equivalence of Complexity Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves the polynomial equivalence of a broad class of definitions of quantum computational complexity. We study right-invariant metrics on the unitary group -- often called `complexity geometries' following the definition of quantum complexity proposed by Nielsen -- and delineate the equivalence class of metrics that have the same computational power as quantum circuits. Within this universality class, any unitary that can be reached in one metric can be approximated in any other metric in the class with a slowdown that is at-worst polynomial in the length and number of qubits and inverse-polynomial in the permitted error. We describe the equivalence classes for two different kinds of error we might tolerate: Killing-distance error, and operator-norm error. All metrics in both equivalence classes are shown to have exponential diameter; all metrics in the operator-norm equivalence class are also shown to give an alternative definition of the quantum complexity class BQP.
  My results extend those of Nielsen et al., who in 2006 proved that one particular metric is polynomially equivalent to quantum circuits. The Nielsen et al. metric is incredibly highly curved. I show that the greatly enlarged equivalence class established in this paper also includes metrics that have modest curvature. I argue that the modest curvature makes these metrics more amenable to the tools of differential geometry, and therefore makes them more promising starting points for Nielsen's program of using differential geometry to prove complexity lowerbounds.</description>

      <title>On the practical usefulness of the Hardware Efficient Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models train a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a given learning task. The success of these algorithms greatly hinges on appropriately choosing an ansatz for the quantum circuit. Perhaps one of the most famous ansatzes is the one-dimensional layered Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), which seeks to minimize the effect of hardware noise by using native gates and connectives. The use of this HEA has generated a certain ambivalence arising from the fact that while it suffers from barren plateaus at long depths, it can also avoid them at shallow ones. In this work, we attempt to determine whether one should, or should not, use a HEA. We rigorously identify scenarios where shallow HEAs should likely be avoided (e.g., VQA or QML tasks with data satisfying a volume law of entanglement). More importantly, we identify a Goldilocks scenario where shallow HEAs could achieve a quantum speedup: QML tasks with data satisfying an area law of entanglement. We provide examples for such scenario (such as Gaussian diagonal ensemble random Hamiltonian discrimination), and we show that in these cases a shallow HEA is always trainable and that there exists an anti-concentration of loss function values. Our work highlights the crucial role that input states play in the trainability of a parametrized quantum circuit, a phenomenon that is verified in our numerics.</description>

      <title>Succinct quantum testers for closeness and $k$-wise uniformity of probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore potential quantum speedups for the fundamental problem of testing the properties of closeness and $k$-wise uniformity of probability distributions.
  Closeness testing is the problem of distinguishing whether two $n$-dimensional distributions are identical or at least $\varepsilon$-far in $\ell^1$- or $\ell^2$-distance. We show that the quantum query complexities for $\ell^1$- and $\ell^2$-closeness testing are $O(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$, respectively, both of which achieve optimal dependence on $\varepsilon$, improving the prior best results of Gily\'en and Li (2020).
  $k$-wise uniformity testing is the problem of distinguishing whether a distribution over $\{0, 1\}^n$ is uniform when restricted to any $k$ coordinates or $\varepsilon$-far from any such distributions. We propose the first quantum algorithm for this problem with query complexity $O(\sqrt{n^k}/\varepsilon)$, achieving a quadratic speedup over the state-of-the-art classical algorithm with sample complexity $O(n^k/\varepsilon^2)$ by O'Donnell and Zhao (2018). Moreover, when $k = 2$ our quantum algorithm outperforms any classical one because of the classical lower bound $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$.
  All our quantum algorithms are fairly simple and time-efficient, using only basic quantum subroutines such as amplitude estimation.</description>

Abstract: A strategy is developed for writing the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger Equation (TDSE), and more generally the Dyson Series, as a convolution equation using recursive Fourier transforms, thereby decoupling the second-order integral from the first without using the time ordering operator. The energy distribution is calculated for a number of standard perturbation theory examples at first- and second-order. Possible applications include characterization of photonic spectra for bosonic sampling and four-wave mixing in quantum computation and Bardeen tunneling amplitude in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Optimal mixers restricted to subspaces and the stabilizer formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17083v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel formalism to both understand and construct mixers that preserve a given subspace. The method connects and utilizes the stabilizer formalism that is used in error correcting codes. This can be useful in the setting when the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), a popular meta-heuristic for solving combinatorial optimization problems, is applied in the setting where the constraints of the problem lead to a feasible subspace that is large but easy to specify. The proposed method gives a systematic way to construct mixers that are resource efficient in the number of controlled not gates and can be understood as a generalization of the well-known X and XY mixers and a relaxation of the Grover mixer: Given a basis of any subspace, a resource efficient mixer can be constructed that preserves the subspace. The numerical examples provided show a dramatic reduction of CX gates when compared to previous results. We call our approach logical X-Mixer or logical X QAOA ($\textbf{LX-QAOA}$), since it can be understood as dividing the subspace into code spaces of stabilizers S and consecutively applying logical rotational X gates associated with these code spaces. Overall, we hope that this new perspective can lead to further insight into the development of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards realization of universal quantum teleportation using weak measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we analyze universal quantum teleportation in the presence of memory or memory-less dynamics with applications of partial collapse measurement operators. Our results show that the combined effects of memory or non-Markovianity and weak measurements can lead to universal quantum teleportation (UQT). Our study involves noise models of physical importance having characteristic Markovian and non-Markovian regions allowing one to observe a transition in quantum properties as one switches from non-Markovian to Markovian dynamics. For this, we characterize the effects of different types of non-Markovianity for efficient UQT both due to retention of correlations for a longer duration and due to information backflow. We further analyze memory effects arising from a correlated channel with or without weak measurements. Interestingly, our analysis for a correlated amplitude damping channel shows that memory effects are of significant advantage to minimize the fidelity deviation. The presence of weak measurements further enhances the realization of UQT in the presence of memory. The ability of memory effects in achieving zero fidelity deviation at non-zero time is interesting and of experimental importance.</description>

      <title>Selective cooling and squeezing in a lossy optomechanical closed loop embodying an exceptional surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed-loop, lossy optomechanical system consisting of one optical and two degenerate mechanical resonators is computationally investigated. This system constitutes an elementary synthetic plaquette derived from the loop phase of the intercoupling coefficients. In examining a specific quantum attribute, we delve into the control of quadrature variances within the resonator selected through the plaquette phase. An amplitude modulation is additionally applied to the cavity-pumping laser to incorporate mechanical squeezing. Our numerical analysis relies on the integration-free computation of steady-state covariances for cooling and the Floquet technique for squeezing. We provide physical insights into how non-Hermiticity plays a crucial role in enhancing cooling and squeezing in proximity to exceptional points. This enhancement is associated with the behavior of complex eigenvalue loci as a function of the intermechanical coupling rate. Additionally, we demonstrate that the parameter space embodies an exceptional surface, ensuring the robustness of exceptional point singularities under experimental parameter variations. However, the pump laser detuning breaks away from the exceptional surface unless it resides on the red-sideband by an amount sufficiently close to the mechanical resonance frequency. Finally, we show that this disparate parametric character entitles frequency-dependent cooling and squeezing, which is of technological importance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lower Bounds by Sample-to-Query Lifting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polynomial method by Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca, and de Wolf (FOCS 1998) and the adversary method by Ambainis (STOC 2000) have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose an arguably new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results:
  1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination.
  2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal.
  3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023).
  4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015).
  In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

Abstract: We provide two improvements to Regev's recent quantum factoring algorithm (arXiv:2308.06572), addressing its space efficiency and its noise-tolerance.
  Our first contribution is to improve the quantum space efficiency of Regev's algorithm while keeping the circuit size the same. Our main result constructs a quantum factoring circuit using $O(n \log n)$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates. We achieve the best of Shor and Regev (upto a logarithmic factor in the space complexity): on the one hand, Regev's circuit requires $O(n^{3/2})$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates, while Shor's circuit requires $O(n^2 \log n)$ gates but only $O(n)$ qubits. As with Regev, to factor an $n$-bit integer $N$, we run our circuit independently $\approx \sqrt{n}$ times and applies Regev's classical postprocessing procedure.
  Our optimization is achieved by implementing efficient and reversible exponentiation with Fibonacci numbers in the exponent, rather than the usual powers of 2, adapting work by Kaliski (arXiv:1711.02491) from the classical reversible setting to the quantum setting. This technique also allows us to perform quantum modular exponentiation that is efficient in both space and size without requiring significant precomputation, a result that may be useful for other quantum algorithms. A key ingredient of our exponentiation implementation is an efficient circuit for a function resembling in-place quantum-quantum modular multiplication.
  Our second contribution is to show that Regev's classical postprocessing procedure can be modified to tolerate a constant fraction of the quantum circuit runs being corrupted by errors. In contrast, Regev's analysis of his classical postprocessing procedure requires all $\approx \sqrt{n}$ runs to be successful. In a nutshell, we achieve this using lattice reduction techniques to detect and filter out corrupt samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonclassicality of a macroscopic single-mode optical superposition state is potentially convertible into entanglement, when the state is mixed with the vacuum on a beam splitter. Considering light beams with polarization degree of freedom in Euclidean space as coherent product states in a bipartite Hilbert space, we propose a method to convert the two orthogonal polarizations into simultaneous entanglement and classical nonseparability through nonclassicality in the superpositions of coherent and displaced Fock states. Equivalent Bell state emerges from the resulted superpositions and the proportion of mixed entanglement and nonseparablity is determined by the displacement amplitudes along the polarization directions. We characterize the state nonclassicality via features in Wigner distributions and propose an experimental method for generating these states and measuring them via homodyne tomography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routing in a quantum network presents unique challenges due to its acquired properties of quantum mechanics like no-cloning, link failure, and entanglement. This study explores an approach to routing in quantum networks, which targets practical scenarios for quantum networks, mirroring real-world classical networks. Thus, it consists of access networks with users acting as sources and destinations, interconnected through a core network of nodes cooperating to establish end-to-end entanglement between them. By addressing practical constraints, we examine the impact of heterogeneous nodes with mixed efficiency figures on quantum network performance. In particular, we focus on some key parameters in an operational quantum network such as the fraction of nodes with a higher efficiency (called high-quality), path establishment order, end-to-end fidelity, i.e., a measure of the quality of the end-to-end entanglement established. Our simulations show that incorporating knowledge of node quality not only helps boost the fidelity of some of the routing paths but also reduces the number of blocked paths in the quantum network. The study also highlights the critical role of the fraction of high-quality nodes in end-to-end fidelity and explores the trade-offs between upgrading all nodes to high quality or retaining a subset of lower-quality nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ising model is the simplest to describe many-body effects in classical statistical mechanics. Duality analysis leads to a critical point under several assumptions. The Ising model itself has $Z(2)$ symmetry. The basis of the duality analysis is a nontrivial relationship between low and high-temperature expansions. However, the discrete Fourier transformation finds the hidden relationship automatically. The duality analysis can be naturally generalized into the case with the degrees of freedom with $Z(q)$ symmetry and random spin systems. We further obtain the duality in a series of permutation models in the present study by considering the symmetric group $S_q$ and its Fourier transformation. The permutation model in the symmetric group is closely related to the random quantum circuits and random tensor network model, often discussed in the context of quantum computing and the holographic principle, a property of string theories and quantum gravity. We provide a systematic way by our duality analysis to analyze the phase transition in these models.</description>

Abstract: Leggett-Garg inequalities place bounds on the temporal correlations of a system based on the principles of macroscopic realism $\textit{per se}$ and noninvasive measurability. Their conventional formulation relies on the ensemble-averaged products of observables measured at different instants of time. However, a complete description that enables a precise understanding and captures all physically relevant features requires the study of probability distributions associated with noncommuting observables. In this article, we propose a scheme to describe the dynamics of generic $N$-level quantum systems ("qudits") via a probability vector representation of the Schr\"odinger equation and define a precise notion of no-signaling in time (NSIT) for the probability distributions of noncommuting observables. This provides a systematic way of identifying the interferences responsible for nonclassical behavior. In addition, we introduce an interference witness measure to quantify violations of NSIT for arbitrary general probabilistic states. For single-qubit systems, we pinpoint the pivotal relation that establishes a connection between the disturbance of observables incurred during a measurement and the resulting NSIT violation. For large-$N$ systems where a manual determination is infeasible, the classification of states as either NSIT-conforming or NSIT-violating may be performed by a machine learning algorithm. We present a proof-of-principle implementation of such an algorithm in which the classifier function is prepared via supervised learning using pseudorandomly generated training data sets composed of states whose corresponding classifications are known $\textit{a priori}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the domain of correlated non-Markovian channels, exploring the potential memory arising from the correlated action of channels and the inherent memory due to non-Markovian dynamics. The impact of channel correlations is studied using different non-Markovianity indicators and measures. In addition, the dynamical aspects of correlated non-Markovian channels, including entanglement dynamics as well as changes in the volume of accessible states, are explored. The analysis is presented for both unital and non-unital correlated channels. A new correlated channel constructed with modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise is also presented and explored. Further, the geometrical effects of the non-Markovianity of the correlated non-Markovian channels are discussed with a study of change in the volume of the accessible states. The link between the correlation factor and error correction success probability is highlighted.</description>

Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved by analytic methods for an external double-well potential that is an infinite square well plus a $\delta$-function central barrier. We find solutions that have the symmetry of the non-interacting Hamiltonian as well as asymmetric solutions that bifurcate from the symmetric solutions for attractive interactions and from the antisymmetric solutions for repulsive interactions. We present a variational approximation to the asymmetric state as well as an approximate numerical approach. Stability of the states is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Expressive Power of Pulse-Based Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) based on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices hinges on the optimal utilization of limited quantum resources. While gate-based QML models are user-friendly for software engineers, their expressivity is restricted by the permissible circuit depth within a finite coherence time. In contrast, pulse-based models enable the construction of "infinitely" deep quantum neural networks within the same time, which may unleash greater expressive power for complex learning tasks. In this paper, this potential is investigated from the perspective of quantum control theory. We first indicate that the nonlinearity of pulse-based models comes from the encoding process that can be viewed as the continuous limit of data-reuploading in gate-based models. Subsequently, we prove that the pulse-based model can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions when the underlying physical system is ensemble controllable. Under this condition, numerical simulations demonstrate the enhanced expressivity by either increasing the pulse length or the number of qubits. As anticipated, we show through numerical examples that the pulse-based model can unleash more expressive power compared to the gate-based model. These findings lay a theoretical foundation for understanding and designing expressive QML models using NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical framework for enabling seamless transfer of digital information from classical microwave domain to the quantum optical domain in wireless-to-optical converters. A quantum mechanical network model is introduced to characterize microwave-to-optical digital information mapping in antenna-coupled electro-optic modulator-based converters. Design guidelines are discussed to maximize the information mapping strength. The derived model is then extended to show phase-space encoding of optical coherent-states with classical wireless microwave constellation. Further, the challenge of inter-symbol overlap in the encoded quantum optical phase-space due to quadrature fluctuations is highlighted. The possibility of erroneous phase-space encoding due to quadrature fluctuations is pointed out, followed by a potential mitigation technique. The presented framework also lays the groundwork for encoding other non-classical states of light such as squeezed states, and hence forms the basis for bridging classical microwave and quantum optical links in the near future.</description>

Abstract: The celebrated Hong--Ou--Mandel effect illustrates the richness of two-photon interferometry. In this work, we show that this richness extends to the realm of time-frequency interferometry. Taking advantage of the mathematical analogy which can be drawn between the frequency and quadrature degrees of freedom of light when there is a single photon in each auxiliary mode, we consider the equivalent of the Hong--Ou--Mandel effect in the frequency domain. In this setting, the $n$-Fock state becomes equivalent to a single-photon state with a spectral wave function given by the $n^{th}$ Hermite--Gauss function and destructive interference corresponds to vanishing probability of detecting single photons with an order one Hermite--Gauss spectral profile. This intriguing analogy leads us to introduce an interferometric strategy using a frequency engineered two-photon state allowing to reach Heisenberg scaling for phase estimation, and to generalise the Gaussian Boson Sampling model to time-frequency degrees of freedom of single photons.</description>

Abstract: We perform an analysis supplementing the metrology toolbox in the time-frequency domain. While the relevant time-frequency-based metrological protocols can be borrowed from the spatial domain, where they have recently been well developed, their ultimate practical usefulness is shown to be restricted by limits put on the bandwidth of both the signal and measurements, as well as by the finite measurement time. As we demonstrate for the well-known problem of multiparameter estimation for two incoherent, point-like sources, the impact of these experimental limitations on the optimal protocol's efficiency can be detrimental. Nonetheless, we propose necessary operational criteria for attainability of the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound under the discussed restrictions.</description>

Abstract: The density classification (DC) task, a computation which maps global density information to local density, is studied using one-dimensional non-unitary quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Two approaches are considered: one that preserves the number density and one that performs majority voting. For number preserving DC, two QCAs are introduced that reach the fixed point solution in a time scaling quadratically with the system size. One of the QCAs is based on a known classical probabilistic cellular automaton which has been studied in the context of DC. The second is a new quantum model that is designed to demonstrate additional quantum features and is restricted to only two-body interactions. Both can be generated by continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. A third QCA is a hybrid rule defined by both discrete-time and continuous-time three-body interactions that is shown to solve the majority voting problem within a time that scales linearly with the system size.</description>

      <title>How coherence measurements of a qubit steer its quantum environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Repetitive Ramsey interferometry measurements (RIMs) are often used to measure qubit coherence, assuming that the environment remains unaffected after each measurement and the outcomes of all measurements are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). While this assumption is valid for a classical environment, it may not hold for a quantum environment due to the non-negligible backaction from qubit to environment. Here we present a general theoretical framework to incorporate the measurement backaction from qubit to environment in sequential RIMs. We show that a RIM of a qubit induces a quantum channel on the quantum environment, and sequential RIMs gradually steer the quantum environment to the fixed points of the channel. We reveal three distinct environment steering effects -- polarization, depolarization and metastable polarization, depending on the commutativity of the noise operator $B$ and the free environment Hamiltonian $H_e$: (1) if $B$ commutes with $H_e$, i.e., $[B,H_e]=0$, the quantum environment is gradually polarized to different eigenstates of $B$ as the number $m$ of repetitive RIMs increases; (2) When $[B,H_e]\neq 0$, the quantum environment is gradually depolarized to a maximally mixed state of its whole Hilbert space or a Hilbert subspace; (3) When $[B,H_e]\neq 0$ but one of $H_e$ and $B$ is a small perturbation on the other, metastable polarization can happen, such that the quantum environment is first polarized for a finite range of $m$ but becomes gradually depolarized as $m$ increases further. The environment steering also makes the measurement statistics of sequential RIMs develop non-i.i.d. features, such that the measurement result distribution can display multiple peaks for a small quantum environment, corresponding to different fixed points of the quantum channel.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum self-sustained oscillator as it evolves toward its limit cycle may be useful in solving related problems like those in quantum synchronization, yet is inadequately studied. Here we investigate the evolution of a quantum Rayleigh-van der Pol (RvdP) oscillator, the simplest form of a self-sustained oscillator exhibiting a quasiharmonic limit cycle, starting from Fock, thermal, and coherent states. We find that the phase-space dynamics significantly differ depending on the initial state -- one evolution toward the limit cycle may take much longer than another and a least-time parameter may be present. We describe the resulting dynamics in terms of the coherence decay and the redistribution of eigenstate occupation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality is a valuable resource in quantum information processing tasks. Scientists are interested in whether a single entangled state can generate a long sequence of nonlocal correlations. Previous work has accomplished sequential tripartite nonlocality sharing through unsharp measurements. In this paper, we investigate the sharing of tripartite nonlocality using only projective measurements and sharing classical randomness. For the generalized GHZ state, we have demonstrated that using unbiased measurement choices, two Charlies can share the standard tripartite nonlocality with a single Alice and a single Bob, while at most one Charlie can share the genuine tripartite nonlocality with a single Alice and a single Bob. However, with biased measurement choices, the number of Charlies sharing the genuine tripartite nonlocality can be increased to two. Nonetheless, we find that using biased measurements does not increase the number of sequential observers sharing the standard tripartite nonlocality. Moreover, we provide the feasible range of double violation for the parameters of the measurement combination probability with respect to the state.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of a trapped atom interferometer with accelerating optical traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to increase the measured phase of an atom interferometer and improve its sensitivity, researchers attempt to increase the enclosed space-time area using two methods: creating larger separations between the interferometer arms and having longer evolution times. However, increasing the evolution time reduces the bandwidth that can be sampled, whereas decreasing the evolution time worsens the sensitivity. In this paper, we attempt to address this by proposing a setup for high-bandwidth applications, with improved overall sensitivity. This is realized by accelerating and holding the atoms using optical dipole traps. We find that accelerations of up to $10^{3}$-$10^{5}$ m/s$^2$ can be achieved using acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) to move the traps. By comparing the sensitivity of our approach to acceleration as a baseline to traditional atom interferometry, we find a substantial improvement to the state of the art. In the limit of appropriate beam and optics stabilization, sensitivities approaching 10$^{-14}$ (m/s$^2$)/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ may be achievable at 1 Hz, while detection at 1 kHz with a sensitivity an order of magnitude better than traditional free-fall atom interferometers is possible with today's systems.</description>

Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system composed of multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of synchronized and desynchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of discrete-time crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the DTC-DMBL-chimeralike state, which is robust against external static fields in a periodically driven quantum many-body system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the role of electron correlation in predicting the S$_1$-S$_0$ and T$_1$-S$_0$ excitation energies and hence, the singlet-triplet gap ($\Delta$E$_{ST}$) in a set of cyclazines which act as templates for potential candidates for 5th generation Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) materials. This issue has recently garnered much interest with the focus being on the inversion of the $\Delta$E$_{ST}$, although experiments have indicated near degenerate levels with both positive and negative being within the experimental error bar (\emph{J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102: 6068 , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986, 108: 17} ). We have carried out a systematic and exhaustive study of various excited state electronic structure methodologies and identified the strengths and shortcomings of the various approaches and approximations in view of this challenging case. We have found that near degeneracy can be achieved either with a proper balance of static and dynamic correlation in multireference theories or with state-specific orbital corrections including its coupling with correlation. The role of spin contamination is also discussed. Eventually, this paper seeks to produce benchmark numbers for establishing cheaper theories which can then be used for screening derivatives of these templates with desirable optical and structural properties. Additionally we would like to point out that the use of DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD as the benchmark for $\Delta$E$_{ST}$ (as used in \emph{J. Phys. Chem. A 2022, 126: 8: 1378, Chem. Phys. Lett. 2021, 779: 138827}) is not a suitable benchmark for this class of molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also briefly discuss mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly.</description>

Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Realizing triality and $p$-ality by lattice twisted gauging in (1+1)d quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14939</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+1)d lattice and construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and $p$-ality (order $p$) mapping on the $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetric Hamiltonians, where $p$ is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with N ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition.</description>
