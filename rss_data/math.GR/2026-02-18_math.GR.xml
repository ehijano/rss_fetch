      <title>Subgroups with all finite lifts isomorphic are conjugate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for non-conjugate subgroups $G_1$ and $G_2$ of a finite group $G$ there exists an extension of $G$ (by a finite group) in which the pre-images of $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic. This allows us to show that $\mathbb Z$-coset equivalent subgroups of a finite group are not necessarily isomorphic, answering a question of Dipendra Prasad. We also indicate connections to profinite rigidity, anabelian geometry, mapping class groups, and non-arithmetic lattices in Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time isomorphism test for $k$-generated extensions of abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group isomorphism problem asks whether two finite groups given by their Cayley tables are isomorphic or not. Although there are polynomial-time algorithms for some specific group classes, the best known algorithm for testing isomorphism of arbitrary groups of order $ n $ has time complexity $ n^{O(\log n)} $. We consider the group isomorphism problem for some extensions of abelian groups by $ k $-generated groups for bounded $ k $. In particular, we prove that one can decide isomorphism of abelian-by-cyclic extensions in polynomial time, generalizing a 2009 result of Le Gall for coprime extensions. As another application, we give a polynomial-time isomorphism test for abelian-by-simple group extensions, generalizing a 2017 result of Grochow and Qiao for central extensions. The main novelty of the proof is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the unit group of a finite ring, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The space of marked Dyer systems, monotonicity, and continuity of growth rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space $\mathcal{G}_n$ of $n$-marked groups provides a natural framework for studying algebraic and geometric invariants under deformation. In general, the growth rate is not continuous on $\mathcal{G}_n$. In this paper, we investigate the subspace $\mathcal{D}_n \subset \mathcal{G}_n$ consisting of $n$-marked Dyer systems, which extend Coxeter systems and include graph products of cyclic groups and right-angled Artin groups. We prove that $\mathcal{D}_n$ is closed in $\mathcal{G}_n$ and introduce a natural partial order on $\mathcal{D}_n$ with respect to which the growth rate is monotonically increasing. As a consequence, the growth rate function $\tau : \mathcal{D}_n \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 1}$ is continuous. The proof combines the solution to the word problem for Dyer systems by Paris and Soergel, the parabolic growth formula by Paris and Varghese, and analytic arguments based on normal convergence and Hurwitz's theorem. This extends the continuity results known for Coxeter systems to the broader class of Dyer systems.</description>

      <title>On the triple product property for subgroups of finite nilpotent groups of class $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of upper bounds are proved relating to the triple product property (TPP) for subgroups of finite nilpotent groups of class $2$. The TPP is the property defined for three non-empty subsets $S, T, U$ of a group $G$ that the group equation $s's^{-1}t't^{-1}u'u^{-1} = 1$, over pairs of elements $s', s \in S$, $t', t \in T$, $u', u \in U$, is satisfied if and only if $s' = s$, $t' = t$, $u' = u$. When $G$ is finite, and the parameter $\rho_0(G)$, called \emph{subgroup TPP ratio}, is defined as $\rho_0(G) := \max\frac{|S||T||U|}{|G|}$, where the maximum is over the collection of all triples of subgroups $S, T, U$ of $G$ satisfying the TPP, this paper proves that \textup{(1)} $\rho_0(G) &lt; \sqrt{|G:Z(G)}$} for (all) groups of nilpotency class $2$, \textup{(2)} $\rho_0(G) \leq p$ for $p$-groups with a cyclic commutator subgroup of order $p$, \textup{(3)} $\rho_0(G) = 1$ for $p$-groups of nilpotency class $2$ with a "large" centre, loosely defined as those satisfying $p^2 \leq |G:Z(G)| \leq p^3$, \textup{(4)} and $\rho_0(G) = 1$ for $p$-groups of nilpotency class $2$ with "small" (irreducible, complex) character degrees of $1$ or $p$.</description>

      <title>Partial actions of free groups and groupoid homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a length one projective resolution of the trivial module for the groupoid of a semi-saturated partial action (in the sense of Exel) of a free group on a compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected space. As a consequence we obtain an elementary computation of the homology of these groupoids, which include transformation groupoids of free group actions and Deaconu-Renault groupoids of systems $(X,T)$ where $X$ is compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected and $T$ is a local homeomorphism with domain a clopen subset of $X$. We also show that algebra of such a partial action groupoid over a field has global dimension at most $2$ when the space is second countable.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of Kimura Hadamard Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the automorphism groups of Kimura Hadamard matrices (KHMs) constructed from dihedral groups. We identify several different types of automorphisms, and show that the automorphism group of a KHM always has a subgroup isomorphic to $D_{2k}\times Q_8$, or $C_2\times D_{2k}\times Q_8$ if it is $y$-invariant. We exhibit additional automorphisms arising from the holomorph of the dihedral group under suitable structural conditions. A comparison with known examples, including those of Kimura, Niwasaki, and matrices arising from the Shinoda--Yamada construction, reveals counterexamples to a conjecture of \'O Catha\'{\i}n and suggests that no further automorphisms occur beyond those predicted by our framework.</description>

      <title>On certain subspaces of $2$-configuration spaces of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large-scale geometry of graph braid groups \(\bbB_n(\graf)\) using the cubical structure of their discrete configuration spaces \(UD_n(\graf)\). First, we give a complete classification of when a graph \(n\)-braid group is free, using only cubical methods and without appealing to discrete Morse theory.
  We then focus on graph \(2\)-braid groups and study the square complex \(UD_2(\graf)\), which is special in the sense of Haglund--Wise, via its maximal product subcomplexes and intersection complex introduced in \cite{Oh22}. Under natural connectivity and embeddedness assumptions, we show that the union \(UP_2(\graf)\) of maximal product subcomplexes of \(UD_2(\graf)\) captures essential quasi-isometry information of \(\bbB_2(\graf)\), the fundamental group of \(UD_2(\graf)\).
  Applying this framework to an infinite family of graphs, we obtain infinitely many graph \(2\)-braid groups that are quasi-isometric to right-angled Artin groups and infinitely many that are not, extending the examples of \cite{Oh22}, and we indicate new phenomena in relative hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>The symmetric groups $S_n, n\geq 4$, and finite non-abelian simple groups are not embeddable in any Riordan group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the symmetric group of degree greater than three cannot be embedded into the Riordan group with coefficients in any commutative ring. We also prove the impossibility to embed finite non-abelian simple groups. As a closely related topic, we show why all truncated Riordan groups are solvable, in stark contrast to the unsolvability of the infinite-sized Riordan groups. Finally, we give an explicit embedding of the alternating group $A_4$ into the Lagrange subgroup with coefficients in a certain commutative ring, and prove that $A_4$ cannot be embedded into a substitution group.</description>

      <title>A note on the scatteredness of reflection orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we characterize affine and non-affine Coxeter systems among all Coxeter systems in terms of the structure of their reflection orders. For an infinite irreducible system $(W,S)$, we show that affineness can be characterized in three equivalent ways: by the scatteredness of all reflection orders, by the existence of a reflection order of type $\omega + \omega^*$, and by a finiteness property of intervals determined by dihedral reflection subgroups. We also show that non-affineness can be characterized by the existence of order types $(\omega + \omega^*)[k]$ for arbitrarily large $k$, obtained by restricting any reflection order to a suitable subset. Our proofs exploit the geometry of projective roots, the isotropic cone, and universal reflection subgroups in infinite non-affine Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of spectral multipliers on locally compact groups and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the noncommutative Lorentz norm (associated to a semifinite von Neumann algebra) of a propagator of the form $\varphi(|\mathscr{L}|)$ can be estimated if the modulus of the Borel function $\varphi$ is bounded by a continuous positive monotonically decreasing function that vanishes at infinity $\psi$. As a consequence, we obtain the $L^p-L^q$ $(1&lt;p\leqslant 2\leqslant q&lt;+\infty)$ norm estimates for the solutions of heat, wave, and Schr\"odinger type equations (new in this setting) on a locally compact separable unimodular group $G$ by using a non-local integro-differential operator in time and any positive left invariant operator (maybe unbounded and with discrete or continuous spectrum) on $G$. We also provide asymptotic estimates (large-time behavior) for the solutions, which in some cases can be claimed to be sharp. Illustrative examples are given for several groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a positive definite even lattice and a commutative ring, there is a standard construction of a lattice vertex algebra over the commutative ring, and it admits a natural grading by non-negative integers. We describe the groups of automorphisms of these graded vertex algebras as affine group schemes, showing in particular that each is an extension of an explicitly described split reductive group of ADE type by the outer automorphism group of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Fractal closures of geodesic planes in Hitchin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem implies topological rigidity of immersed totally geodesic subspaces of noncompact type in finite-volume locally symmetric spaces. In higher rank and infinite volume, however, counter-examples to this rigidity have remained elusive.
  We construct the first such examples using \emph{floating geodesic planes}. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that the Hitchin manifold $\Gamma \backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R}) / \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains immersed floating geodesic planes whose closures are fractal, with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions accumulating at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>
