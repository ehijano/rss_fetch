      <title>Synergies between Euclid, Roman and JWST Could Reveal Quasars at up to $z \sim$ 15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centers of most galaxies today, over 300 have now been discovered at $z &gt;$ 6, including a $4 \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ BH in UHZ1 at $z = 10.1$ and an $8\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ BH in GHZ9 at $z =$ 10.4. They are thought to form when 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ primordial stars die as direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) at $z \sim$ 20 - 25. While studies have shown that DCBHs should be visible at birth at $z \gtrsim$ 20 in the near infrared (NIR) to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), none have considered SMBH detections at later stages growth down to $z \sim$ 6 - 7. Here, we present continuum NIR luminosities for a quasar like ULAS J1120+0641, a $1.35 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ BH at $z =$ 7.1, from a cosmological simulation for Euclid, Roman Space Telescope (RST) and JWST bands from $z =$ 6 - 15. We find that Euclid and RST could detect such BHs, including others like UHZ1 and GHZ9, at much earlier stages of evolution, out to $z \sim$ 14 - 15, and that their redshifts could be confirmed spectroscopically with JWST. Synergies between these three telescopes could thus reveal the numbers of quasars at much higher redshifts and discriminate between their formation channels because Euclid and RST can capture large numbers of them in wide-field surveys for further study by JWST.</description>

      <title>Optical Strong Line Ratios Cannot Distinguish Between Stellar Populations and Accreting Black Holes at High Ionization Parameters and Low Metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift observations from JWST indicate that optical strong line ratios do not carry the same constraining power as they do at low redshifts. Critically, this prevents a separation between stellar- and black hole-driven ionizing radiation, thereby obscuring both active galactic nuclei demographics and star formation rates. To investigate this, we compute a large suite of photoionization models from Cloudy powered by stellar populations and accreting black holes over a large grid of ages, metallicities, initial mass functions, binarity, ionization parameters, densities, and black hole masses. We use these models to test three rest-frame optical strong line ratio diagnostics which have been designed to separate ionizing sources at low redshifts: the [NII]-BPT, VO87, and OHNO diagrams. We show that the position of a model in these diagrams is strongly driven by the ionization parameter (log U) and the gas-phase metallicity, often more so than the ionizing spectrum itself; in particular, there is significant overlap between stellar population and accreting black hole models at high log U and low Z. We show that the OHNO diagram is especially susceptible to large contamination of the AGN region defined at z=1 for stellar models with high log U and low Z, consistent with many observed JWST spectra at high redshift. We show that the optical line ratio diagnostics are most sensitive to the shape of the &lt;54 eV ionizing continuum, and that the derived ionizing sources for a given set of optical strong line ratios can be highly degenerate. Finally, we demonstrate that very high ionization (&gt;54 eV) emission lines that trace ionizing sources harder than normal stellar populations help to break the degeneracies present when using the strong line diagnostics alone, even in gas conditions consistent with those at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XXIII. First spatially resolved kinematics of the lens galaxy obtained using JWST-NIRSpec to improve time-delay cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved stellar kinematics has become a key ingredient in time-delay cosmography to break the mass-sheet degeneracy in the mass profile and, in turn, provide a precise constraint on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters. In this paper, we present the first measurements of 2D resolved stellar kinematics for the lens galaxy in the quadruply lensed quasar system \lensname, using integral field spectroscopy from the JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), marking the first such measurement conducted with the JWST. In extracting robust kinematic measurements from this first-of-its-kind dataset, we made methodological improvements both in the data reduction and kinematic extraction. In our kinematic extraction procedure, we performed joint modeling of the lens galaxy, the quasar, and its host galaxy's contributions in the spectra to deblend the lens galaxy component and robustly constrain its stellar kinematics. Our improved methodological frameworks are released as software pipelines for future use: \textsc{squirrel} for extracting stellar kinematics, and \textsc{RegalJumper} for JWST-NIRSpec data reduction, incorporating additional artifact cleaning beyond the standard JWST pipeline. We compared our measured stellar kinematics from the JWST NIRSpec with previously obtained ground-based measurements from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field unit and find that the two datasets are statistically consistent at a $\sim$1.1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our measured kinematics will be used in a future study to improve the precision of the Hubble constant measurement.</description>

      <title>REBELS-MOSFIRE: Weak CIII] Emission is Typical Among Extremely UV-bright, Massive Galaxies at $z\sim7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Keck/MOSFIRE H-band spectroscopic measurements covering the [CIII]1907, CIII]1909 doublet for a sample of 8 z~7 spectroscopically-confirmed star-forming galaxies drawn from the Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS). This sample is notable for its bright median UV luminosity (Muv=-22.5 AB) and large median stellar mass (log(Mstar/Msun)=9.2). Although three sources show tentative evidence of a CIII] detection, we obtain no confident detections for any of the 8 REBELS sources. The median [CIII]1907+CIII]1909 3-sigma upper limit in equivalent width (EW) for the REBELS-MOSFIRE sample is 6.5 AA, and a stack of their H-band MOSFIRE spectra yields a non-detection with an associated 3-sigma upper limit of 2.6 AA. These upper limits fall significantly below the CIII] EW measured in a composite spectrum of representative z~7 star-forming galaxies, as well as those measured for notable early star-forming galaxies such as GN-z11, GHZ2, GS-z12, and RXCJ2248-ID. The lack of strong CIII] emission can be understood within the context of the stellar populations of the REBELS galaxies, as well as the ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicity implied by rest-frame optical spectroscopic properties ([OIII]+Hb EWs, and [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 and [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 line ratios). The REBELS-MOSFIRE sample represents the higher-mass, higher-metallicity, lower-excitation tail of the z~7 galaxy population, whose ionizing properties must be fully characterized to constrain the role of star-forming galaxies during cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>CANUCS/Technicolor Data Release 1: Imaging, Photometry, Slit Spectroscopy, and Stellar Population Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first data release of the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), a JWST Cycle 1 GTO program targeting 5 lensing clusters and flanking fields in parallel (Abell 370, MACS0416, MACS0417, MACS1149, MACS1423; survey area \tilda100 arcmin$^{2}$), with NIRCam imaging, NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, and NIRSpec prism multi-object spectroscopy. Fields centered on cluster cores include imaging in 8 bands from 0.9-4.4$\mu$m, alongside continuous NIRISS coverage from 1.15-2$\mu$m, while the NIRCam flanking fields provide 5 wide and 9 medium band filters for exceptional spectral sampling, all to \tilda29 mag$_{AB}$. We also present JWST in Technicolor, a Cycle 2 follow-up GO program targeting 3 CANUCS clusters (Abell 370, MACS0416, MACS1149). The Technicolor program adds NIRISS slitless spectroscopy in F090W to the cluster fields while adding 8 wide, medium, and narrow band filters to the flanking fields. This provides NIRCam imaging in all wide and medium band filters over \tilda30 arcmin$^{2}$. This paper describes our data reduction and photometry methodology. We release NIRCam, NIRISS, and HST imaging, PSFs, PSF-matched imaging, photometric catalogs, and photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. We provide lens models and stellar population parameters in up to 19 filters for \tilda53,000 galaxies in the cluster fields, and \tilda44,000 galaxies in up to 29 filters in the flanking fields. We further present 733 NIRSpec spectra and redshift measurements up to $z=10.8$. Comparing against our photometric redshifts, we find catastrophic outlier rates of only 4-7\% and scatter of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}$ of 0.01-0.03.</description>

      <title>AGN with massive black holes have closer galactic neighbors: k-Nearest-Neighbor statistics of an unbiased sample of AGN at z~0.03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveal important information on the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Previous AGN clustering measurements using 2-point correlation functions have hinted that AGN with massive black holes preferentially reside in denser cosmic regions than AGN with less-massive SMBHs. At the same time, little to no dependence on the accretion rate is found. However, the significance of such trends have been limited. Here we present kth-nearest-neighbor (kNN) statistics of 2MASS galaxies around AGN from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic survey. These statistics have been shown to contribute additional higher-order clustering information on the cosmic density field. By calculating the distances to the nearest 7 galaxy neighbors in angular separation to each AGN within two redshift ranges(0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.03 and 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.06), we compare their cumulative distribution functions to that of a randomly distributed sample to show the sensitivity of this method to the clustering of AGN. We also split the AGN into bins of bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio (while controlling for redshift) to search for trends between kNN statistics and fundamental AGN properties. We find that AGN with massive SMBHs have significantly closer neighbors than AGN with less-massive SMBHs (at the 99.98% confidence level), especially in our lower redshift range. We find less significant trends with luminosity or Eddington ratio. By comparing our results to empirical SMBH-galaxy-halo models implemented in N-body simulations, we show that small-scale kNN trends with black hole mass may go beyond stellar mass dependencies. This suggests that massive SMBHs in the local universe reside in more massive dark matter halos and denser regions of the cosmic web, which may indicate that environment is important for the growth of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Kinematic misalignment as a driver of black hole activity in galaxies with external interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) fuelling relies on the transport of gas across several orders of magnitude in physical scale until the gas reaches the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy. This work explores the role of kinematically misaligned gas in the fuelling of AGN in a sample of 4769 local galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We investigate for the first time the relative role of external interactions and the presence of kinematic misalignment as mechanisms to explain the observed increase in AGN fraction in galaxies with large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment ($&gt;$45 degrees). Using a sample of galaxies with evidence of recent external interactions we find that there is a significantly higher fraction of AGN in those where a large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment is observed (20$^{+6}_{-4}\%$) compared with 6.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\%$ in galaxies where no kinematic misalignment is observed. We determine that gas to stellar misalignment has an important role in the fraction of AGN observed, increasing the AGN fraction beyond the potential effect of external interactions. This result demonstrates the importance of misaligned structures to the fuelling of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>BASS. XLIV. Morphological preferences of local hard X-ray selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present morphological classifications for the hosts of 1189 hard X-ray selected (14-195 keV) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Swift-BAT 105-month catalog as part of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). BASS provides a powerful all-sky census of nearby AGN, minimizing obscuration biases and providing a robust dataset for studying AGN-host galaxy connections. Classifications are based on volunteer-based visual inspection on the Zooniverse platform, adapted from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD). Dual-contrast grz color composite images, generated from public surveys (e.g., NOAO Legacy Survey, Pan-STARRS, SDSS) and dedicated observations enabled key morphological features to be identified. Our analysis reveals that, with respect to a control sample of inactive galaxies matched in redshift and i-band magnitude, BASS AGN hosts show a deficiency of smooth ellipticals (~70%) and disks with prominent arms (~80%), while displaying an excess of mergers or disturbed systems (~400%), and disk galaxies without a spiral structure (~300%). These trends suggest a preference for AGN activity in gas-rich, dynamically disturbed environments or transitional disk systems. We also find a higher bar fraction among AGN hosts than the control sample (~50% vs. ~30%). We further explore the relations between AGN properties (e.g., X-ray luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio) and host morphology, and find that high-luminosity and high-accretion AGN preferentially reside in smooth or point-like hosts. In parallel, lower-luminosity AGN are more common in disk galaxies. These results underscore the importance of morphological studies in understanding the fueling and feedback mechanisms that drive AGN activity and their role in galaxy evolution. Our dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future multiwavelength surveys (e.g. LSST, Roman, and Euclid) and automated morphological classification efforts.</description>

      <title>Towards an Observational Detection of Halo Spin Bias using Spin-Orbit Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The clustering of dark-matter halos depends primarily on halo mass. However, at fixed halo mass, numerical simulations have revealed multiple secondary dependencies. This so-called secondary halo bias has important implications for our understanding of structure formation and observational cosmology. Despite its significance, the effect has not yet been measured observationally with statistical confidence. Aims. We aim to develop the first observational method to probe halo spin bias: the secondary dependence of halo clustering on halo spin at fixed halo mass. Methods. We use a proxy for halo spin based on the coherent motion of galaxies within and around a halo. This technique is tested using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation and subsequently applied to a group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By splitting the SDSS groups according to this spin proxy and measuring the two-point correlation function of the resulting samples, the existence of halo spin bias is investigated. Results. We find consistent indications that, at fixed mass, groups with higher values of the spin proxy exhibit higher bias than those with lower spin proxy values, on scales of 5-15 ${h}^{-1}$$\mathrm{Mpc}$. The highest significance is seen for groups with halo masses ${M}_{\rm h} \gtrsim {10}^{13.2}$ ${h}^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$, for which 85$\%$ of the sampled measurements display the expected trend. As we continue to improve the method, our results could open new avenues for studying the connection between halo spin and the large-scale structure with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Multiwavelength Study of the OH Megamaser galaxy IRAS 09320+6134</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength study of the gas distribution, kinematics and excitation of the OH megamaser galaxy IRAS 09320+6134 (UGC 5101) using Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit, Hubble Space Telescope, and Very Large Array observations. The HST ACS F814W i-band and H$\alpha$ + [N II] $\lambda\lambda$ 6548,84 narrow-band images indicate that this galaxy is a late-stage merger. The ionized gas emission in the inner $\sim$ 2 kpc radius, traced by the GMOS data, is consistent with two kinematic components: (i) a rotating disk, observed as a narrow component in the emission-line profiles, with velocity dispersion of $\sigma$ $\leq$ 200 km s$^{-1}$, and (ii) an outflow, traced by a broad component in the emission-line profiles, with $\sigma\geq$ 500 km s$^{-1}$. The disk component is well reproduced by a model of rotation in a plane with similar orientation to that of the large-scale galaxy disk. The outflow component presents bulk velocities of up to -500 km s$^{-1}$ and corresponds to a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_o = 0.122 \pm 0.026 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Emission-line ratio diagrams indicate that the gas excitation is mainly due to an active galactic nucleus, likely the driver of the outflow. The VLA radio image reveals a dominant radio core with two-sided emission along the NE-SW direction. The radio core's spectral index and brightness temperature indicate AGN emission, with the extended emission resembling both in morphology and spectral index the emission observed in radio-quiet quasars. Combined with previous similar studies of other OHM galaxies, the present work supports that this phase is linked to the triggering of an AGN, that seems to occur in the final stages of a merger.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Analysis of Pictor II: a very low metallicity ultra-faint dwarf galaxy bound to the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Magellan/IMACS and Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Pictor~II (Pic~II) that is located only 12 kpc from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From the IMACS spectroscopy, we identify 13 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric velocity of $326.9\pm1.1~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a velocity dispersion of $3.5_{-0.9}^{+1.1}~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a mean metallicity of $\overline{{\rm [Fe/H]}}=-2.99\pm0.06$, and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;0.18$. We measure detailed elemental abundances for the brightest star, finding $\mbox{[Fe/H]} = -3.3$, high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, and no detectable neutron capture elements, similar to stars in other UFDs. However, this star has an unusually high [Sc/Fe] ratio. The dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M/L=760_{-420}^{+910}~M_{\odot}~L^{-1}_{\odot}$), size, and chemical abundances confirms that Pic~II is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. We perform detailed orbit modeling of Pic~II in a combined Milky Way (MW) and LMC potential and find that Pic~II is highly likely to be a long-term LMC satellite. Furthermore, we find that Pic II is likely still bound to the LMC today. Pic~II is the seventh LMC-associated UFD and among the most metal-poor UFDs known. We further update the morphological parameters with deeper Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry, compute the dark matter properties for dark matter indirect detection searches, verify the extremely low metallicity with narrowband CaHK imaging, and briefly discuss tidal influences of the LMC and MW.</description>

      <title>Decoding AGN Feedback with X-arithmetic: From Morphology to Physical Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a key process in the evolution of massive halos in the Universe. New observational information on feedback is crucial for improving the implementation of the physics in numerical models. In this work, we apply a novel image-manipulation technique, termed 'X-arithmetic', to a sample of 15 galaxy clusters and groups deeply observed with Chandra. This technique decomposes perturbations in feedback-dominated regions into images excluding either (1) weak shocks and sound waves, (2) bubbles inflated by jets, or (3) cooling and slow gas motions (isobaric perturbations), enabling efficient spatial identification of these features without involving spectroscopic analysis. We confirm the nature of previously (spectroscopically-)identified features and newly establish the origin of other structures. We find that feedback produces multiple shocks in groups and massive galaxies, but only one to two shocks in clusters. Prominent isobaric structures are abundant around inner cavities in clusters, compared to almost no such structures in groups. These differences suggest that feedback effects are stronger in smaller-mass systems, possibly due to the shallower gravitational potential of groups or more violent feedback. Follow-up spectroscopy, guided by the X-arithmetic results, suggests that earlier-identified "isothermal shocks" could be a mix of isobaric and adiabatic structures. We applied X-arithmetic to galaxy cluster simulations, demonstrating its straightforward application and future potential for testing the feedback physics details in simulations. Our feasibility study shows that imaging data from future X-ray observatories like AXIS will be ideal for expanding X-arithmetic application to a larger sample of objects.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Radio Source Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation telescope facilities brings with it an unprecedented amount of data, and the demand for effective tools to process and classify this information has become increasingly important. This work proposes a novel approach to quantify the radio galaxy morphology, through the development of a series of algorithmic metrics that can quantitatively describe the structure of radio source, and can be applied to radio images in an automatic way. These metrics are intuitive in nature and are inspired by the intrinsic structural differences observed between the existing Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphology types. The metrics are defined in categories of asymmetry, blurriness, concentration, disorder, and elongation ($ABCDE$/single-lobe metrics), as well as the asymmetry and angle between lobes (source metrics). We apply these metrics to a sample of $480$ sources from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe Pilot Survey (EMU-PS) and $72$ well resolved extensively studied sources from An Atlas of DRAGNs, a subset of the revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3CRR). We find that these metrics are relatively robust to resolution changes, independent of each other, and measure fundamentally different structural components of radio galaxy lobes. These metrics work particularly well for sources with reasonable signal-to-noise and well separated lobes. We also find that we can recover the original FR classification using probabilistic combinations of our metrics, highlighting the usefulness of our approach for future large data sets from radio sky surveys.</description>

      <title>The NIKA2 cosmological legacy survey at 2 mm: catalogs, colors, redshift distributions, and implications for deep surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter galaxy surveys are particularly effective in detecting dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshift. While such observations are typically conducted at ~1mm, studies suggest that 2mm may be better suited for selecting sources at even higher redshifts. We use the unprecedented 2mm data from the N2CLS, together with the SIDES simulation, to study and interpret the statistical properties of 2mm-selected galaxies. We use the N2CLS robust sample at 2mm, which contains 25 sources in the deep GOODS-N field and 90 sources in the wide COSMOS. The sources are matched with the N2CLS 1.2mm sources, the ancillary 850um sources, and redshift catalogs to study the colors and redshift distributions. We also produce end-to-end simulations based on SIDES and the observed N2CLS detector timelines to interpret the data. We find a mean S2/S1.2 color of 0.215$\pm$0.006 with a standard deviation of 0.056$\pm$0.004. We measure a mean redshift of $3.6\pm0.3$ in GOODS-N, which is marginally higher than expectations from SIDES ($3.0\pm0.2$) because of an overdensity at $z\sim5.2$, and $3.0\pm0.2$ in COSMOS, which agrees with the $3.2\pm0.2$ predicted by SIDES. We also show that the observed S2/S1.2 colors exhibit a weak dependence with redshift but a large dispersion, which limits its efficiency to select high-z sources. Finally, we studied the nine 2mm sources not detected at 1.2mm, and found that two of them are radiogalaxies, one is a z~2 galaxy, and the remaining six are compatible with the expected number of spurious detections. The N2CLS survey shows no evidence for any exotic 2mm-only galaxy population. Using SIDES, we show that 2mm samples have a higher mean redshift compared to 1.2mm because they miss z~2 dusty galaxies. Finally, we compare the N2CLS with the ex-MORA survey and show that N2CLS is more efficient than interferometric observations to build samples of high-z dusty galaxies.</description>

      <title>The dynamical lineage of ultra-diffuse galaxies from TNG50-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) continues to remain a puzzle. Similarities and differences in the morphological and the kinematical properties of the UDGs with their possible precursors, namely low-surface brightness (LSBs), L*-type high-surface brightness (HSBs) and dwarf galaxies, may provide crucial constraints on their origin and evolution. We selected samples of UDGs, LSBs, HSBs and dwarfs from TNG50-1. We first obtained a few possible scaling relations involving some mass properties to analyse if the regression fits for UDGs are in compliance with those of the other samples. Then, we studied individual galaxy cutouts to evaluate the intrinsic shapes of their dark-matter (DM) and stellar components, orbital and kinematical properties related to their stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we constructed the mock IFU data using the SimSpin code to extract the stellar kinematic moment maps. We observe that the UDGs and the dwarf galaxies have nearly similar regression fits in a. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs gas mass, b. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs total dynamical mass, c. stellar central surface density vs ratio of stellar-to-total dynamical mass, and d. total baryonic mass vs total dynamical mass parameter spaces. Next, we find that the isolated UDGs are prolate rotators similar to the dwarf population, while the tidally-bound UDGs can exhibit both prolate and oblate-rotating shapes. The DM and stellar velocity anisotropy properties of the UDGs suggest that they reside in a cored, dwarf-like halo and may be classified by early-type galaxies. Finally, the stellar kinematic properties suggest that both the UDGs and the dwarfs are slow-rotators having low to nearly no-rotations in contrast to the late-type, disc-dominated, fast-rotating LSBs and HSBs. Therefore, we may conclude that the UDGs and the dwarfs possibly have a common dynamical lineage.</description>

      <title>JADES reveals a large population of low mass black holes at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a large population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the distant universe, which are challenging our understanding of early massive black hole seeding and growth. We expand the exploration of this population to lower luminosities by stacking $\sim 600$ NIRSpec grating spectra from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) at $3&lt;z&lt;7$, in bins of redshift, [OIII]5007 luminosity and equivalent width, UV luminosity and stellar mass. In various stacks, we detect a broad component of H$\alpha$ without a counterpart in [OIII], implying that it is not due to outflows but is tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of a large population of low-luminosity AGN not detected in individual spectra. We also consider the possible contribution from Supernovae (SNe) and Very Massive Stars and conclude that while this is very unlikely, we cannot exclude some potential contribution by SNe to some of the stacks. The detection, in some stacks, of high [OIII]4363/H$\gamma$, typical of AGN, further confirms that such stacks reveal a large population of AGN. We infer that the stacks probe black holes with masses of a few times $10^6~M_\odot$ accreting at rates $L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.02-0.1$, i.e. a low mass and dormant parameter space poorly explored by previous studies on individual targets. We identify populations of black holes that fall within the scatter of the local $M_{BH}-M_{*}$ scaling relation, indicating that there is a population of high-z BHs that are not overmassive relative to their host galaxies and which have been mostly missed in previous JWST observations. Yet, on average, the stacks are still overmassive relative the local relation, with some of them 1-2 dex above it. We infer that the BH mass function (BHMF) at $3&lt;z&lt;5$ rises steeply at low masses. The BHMF is consistent with models in which BHs evolve through short bursts of super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>Cool Gas in the Circumgalactic Medium of Massive Post Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing the interplay between galaxies and their gaseous surroundings is crucial for understanding how galaxies form and evolve, including the roles of long-lived cool gas reservoirs, starburst and AGN driven outflows. We use stacked Mg II absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars to study the cool gas out to 9Mpc from massive quiescent, star-forming and post-starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{gal}}/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.4$ and $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$ selected from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we observe a decline in absorption strength indicating a decrease in cool gas content with increasing distance from the galaxies, as well as decreasing star formation rate of the galaxies. Beyond 1Mpc, this decline levels off to the same absorption strength in all galaxy types, suggesting a transition from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to the intergalactic medium (IGM) at approximately the virial radius of the host dark matter haloes. We find that post-starburst galaxies, that have experienced a recent burst of star formation that has rapidly quenched, exhibit significantly stronger Mg II absorption within 1Mpc than star-forming or quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Because post-starburst galaxies are a potentially significant pathway for the formation of quiescent elliptical galaxies, our results have wide reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in quenching star formation in galaxies. We speculate that the excess cool gas absorption out to 1Mpc around post-starburst galaxies is related to their observed high velocity ($\sim$1000\,km/s) cool gas outflows. Thus, strong, short-lived bursts of star formation impact the CGM around galaxies on Mpc distances and Gyr timescales.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation with Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing from DES Year 3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework to study the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the total mass of its host dark matter halo using galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We model a wide range of scales, roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy sample in the range of $\log M_\star/M_\odot \sim 9.6$ to $\sim 11.5$; 2) the joint-modeling framework of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing that is able to describe our stellar mass-selected sample deep into the 1-halo regime; and 3) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) constraints from this dataset. In general, our SHMR constraints agree well with existing literature with various weak lensing measurements. We constrain the free parameters in the SHMR functional form $\log M_\star (M_h) = \log(\epsilon M_1) + f\left[ \log\left( M_h / M_1 \right) \right] - f(0)$, with $f(x) \equiv -\log(10^{\alpha x}+1) + \delta [\log(1+\exp(x))]^\gamma / [1+\exp(10^{-x})]$, to be $\log M_1 = 11.559^{+0.334}_{-0.415}$, $\log \epsilon = -1.689^{+0.333}_{-0.220}$, $\alpha = -1.637^{+0.107}_{-0.096}$, $\gamma = 0.588^{+0.265}_{-0.220}$ and $\delta = 4.227^{+2.223}_{-1.776}$. The inferred average satellite fraction is within $\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with redshift or stellar mass. Furthermore, we find that the inferred average galaxy bias values follow the generally expected trends with stellar mass and redshift. Our study is the first SHMR in DES in this mass range, and we expect the stellar mass sample to be of general interest for other science cases.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Mass Distribution and Gravitational Potential of Nearby Disk Galaxies: Implications for the ISM Dynamical Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize stellar, gas, and dark matter mass distributions for 17 nearby massive disk galaxies from the PHANGS sample. This allows us to compute the gravitational potential that vertically confines the interstellar gas and determines its equilibrium scale height and weight. We first combine dynamical mass constraints from existing CO and HI rotation curves together with stellar and gas mass estimates from near-infrared, CO, and HI data. These estimates incorporate current best practices in modeling stellar mass-to-light ratios and CO-to-H2 conversion factor variations. Then, we fit joint stellar--gas--dark matter mass models to the rotation curves, adopting the classic maximal disk assumption to account for remaining zero-point uncertainties on the stellar mass-to-light ratio. After obtaining three-component radial mass profiles, we calculate the vertical equilibrium gas scale height and ISM weight in the combined gravitational potential. We find the gas scale height $H_\text{gas}$ increases from ${\lesssim}100$pc in the inner disks to ${&gt;}500$pc at large radii, consistent with observations of our Galaxy and other edge-on galaxies. The gas weight is dominated by stellar gravity at small radii, but the gas and dark matter gravity often become important beyond 3-6 times the stellar disk radial scale length. Both our gas scale height and weight estimates are dependent on the treatment of stellar disk scale height $H_\star$, with $H_\text{gas}$ varying by 30-40% when $H_\star$ varies by a factor of 3. The relationship between our refined ISM weight estimates and local star formation surface density generally agrees with previous observations and predictions from theory and simulations.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT radio continuum imaging of nearby star-forming spirals in the NGC 6221, NGC 3256/3263, and NGC 2434 galaxy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We present high-resolution MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum images of star-forming spirals in the nearby galaxy groups around NGC 6221, NGC 3256/3263 and NGC 2434. This sample spans the evolutionary timeline for galaxy groups, encompassing early, intermediate, and late stages, respectively. The NGC 6221 group contains an interacting galaxy pair with tidal debris, along with at least three dwarf galaxies. In contrast, the NGC 3256/3263 group represents a loose group consisting of several spiral as well as dwarf galaxies, while a massive elliptical galaxy dominates the NGC 2434 group. Aims. We study the star formation activity in all detected galaxies, as it is one of the dominant physical processes in their formation and evolution, seeking evidence of environmental impact. Methods. We use MeerKAT radio continuum data and archival WISE infrared data to locate and measure the star formation rate in all group members. In particular, we used polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as tracers of gas heated due to star formation activity. Furthermore, we create in-band spectral index maps, providing insights into the underlying physical processes associated with the detected star-forming regions. Results. We found that galaxies are distributed differently in the WISE colour-colour diagram depending on their evolutionary group stage, as expected. Except for ESO 059-G012, the galaxies in our sample follow the radio-W3PAH correlation. A possible scenario that explains the ESO 059-G012 result is that the galaxy has already consumed the gas. We also found evidence that the interaction among the spiral galaxies NGC 3263, NGC 3256B and NGC 3256C is causing the Vela Cloud complex and that the galaxies NGC 6221 and NGC 3256 might host a low-luminosity AGN, as was previously proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Resupplying planetary debris to old white dwarfs with supernova blast waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One challenge with explaining how high levels of planetary debris can enrich, or "pollute", old ($\sim$3 Gyr) and very old ($\sim$10 Gyr) white dwarfs is that debris reservoirs deplete on shorter timescales, akin to the solar system's already eviscerated Main Belt and Kuiper Belt. Here, I explore how these extrasolar reservoirs can be resupplied through supernovae that propel distant ($\gtrsim 10^4$ au) dust, sand and pebbles, and potentially boulders and comets, into the inner ($\lesssim 10^2$ au) planetary system. I analytically constrain the geometry of these blast waves, and derive expressions for the probability of apt blast configurations occurring. I then derive the minimum kick magnitudes needed to generate stable, leaky and broken post-blast orbits, and prove that within this formalism, at most 23 per cent of true anomalies along an eccentric orbit could allow for resupplied planetary debris to experience repeated pericentre passages. By linking these kick magnitudes with debris sizes and relating these quantities to the local neighbourhood supernova rate, I conclude that the probabilities for ejection or resupply per supernova blast are $\approx$100 per cent for micron-sized dust and millimetre-sized pebbles and sand, and $\approx$0 per cent for asteroids larger than $\sim$10 km. In between these extremes, I expect metre-sized boulders to be resupplied at least once to very old white dwarfs over their cooling ages. The efficacy of this debris delivery mechanism is dependent on the time-varying sources and sinks in an exo-Oort cloud and how its parent white dwarf has, throughout its cooling age, traversed the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Faint-End Slope of the FRB Energy Function Using CHIME/FRB Catalog-1 and Local Volume Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite hundreds of detected fast radio bursts (FRBs), the faint-end slope ($\gamma$) of their energy distribution remains poorly constrained, hindering understanding of whether bright, cosmological FRBs and faint, Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154-like bursts share a common origin. In this study, we constrain this faint-end slope, modeled with a Schechter-like distribution, by searching for potential associations between bursts from the CHIME/FRB Catalog-1 and galaxies in the local volume. We cross-matched Catalog-1 FRBs with 495 local volume galaxies within 21 Mpc, identified from the HECATE catalog, and found no associations. Assuming the FRB energy function extends to $\sim 3 \times 10^{34}$ erg-the energy of the Galactic magnetar burst from SGR 1935+2154-this null result constrains $\gamma$ to be $&lt;$ 2.3 (95% confidence upper limit), representing the first empirical estimate for extragalactic FRBs at such low energies. This finding supports the hypothesis that the FRB population is dominated by bright, likely cosmological bursts with a relatively flat energy distribution ($\gamma &lt; 2.5$). However, the constraint weakens if higher energy thresholds are assumed. A flatter energy function is consistent with the observed anti-correlation between FRB dispersion measure and fluence, as seen across various observational bands. While the contribution of low-energy bursts, such as those from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, appears minimal, our results suggest that normal magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 could dominate the FRB population if their burst rates and energies scale with age and magnetic field. Upcoming CHIME/FRB Catalog-2 data and targeted nearby galaxy surveys will further refine these constraints, offering critical insight into whether FRBs arise from a single population or diverse origins.</description>

      <title>Apache Point Observatory follow-up of ACcelerating Candidate ExopLanet host Stars (APO ACCELS): Ages for 166 Accelerating Stars in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly imaged substellar companions with well-constrained ages and masses serve as vital empirical benchmarks for planet formation and evolution models. Potential benchmark companions can be identified from astrometric accelerations of their host stars. We use Gaia DR3 and Hipparcos astrometry to identify 166 northern hemisphere stars with astrometric accelerations consistent with a substellar companion between 0.5'' and 1''. For this accelerating sample we identify young stars using APO/ARCES spectra and TESS light curves. From spectroscopic screening of the sample, we measure ages for 24 stars with detectable amounts of lithium, place lower age limits on 135 stars with lithium non-detections, and measure ages from R'HK for 34 stars. 129 stars have TESS light curves from which we measure ages for 20 stars with rotation rates &lt; 15 days, and we identify 3 eclipsing binaries. We present median ages and confidence intervals of age posteriors for the entire sample and discuss how the overall age distribution of our sample compares to a uniform star formation rate in the solar neighborhood. We identify 47 stars with median ages &lt; 2 Gyr, 31 stars with median ages &lt; 1 Gyr, and 14 stars with median ages &lt; 0.5 Gyr, making them high-priority targets for direct imaging follow-up.</description>

      <title>A search of periodic variable stars in the LMC by JWST photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on high-resolution near-infrared photometric data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) targeting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), this study attempts to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity limits of variable star detection in crowded stellar fields. Through light curve analysis, we identified a total of 304 periodic variable stars, including 71 EW-type eclipsing binaries, 7 EA-type eclipsing binaries, 177 rotational variables, 38 $\delta$ Scuti (DSCT) stars, and 12 RR Lyrae stars. Period--luminosity relations (PLRs) were derived for EW-type eclipsing binaries, DSCT stars, and RR Lyrae stars. The PLRs for EW-type and RR Lyrae stars are in good agreement with previous studies, while the PLR zero point for DSCT stars appears systematically fainter by approximately 0.15--0.30 mag. Our PLRs exhibit low dispersion and are minimally affected by crowding. We analyzed the capability of JWST archival data to detect low-amplitude variables and found that only stars with amplitudes greater than approximately 0.05 mag can be reliably detected. Through simulations, we quantified how increasing the number of photometric epochs improves the detectability of low-amplitude, low signal-to-noise ratio variables. Despite current limitations in observational cadence, JWST demonstrates unique advantages in detecting short-period eclipsing binaries, rotational variables, and high-amplitude pulsators. Its exceptional spatial resolution enables high-precision PLR calibrations, offering new opportunities for future studies in variable star astrophysics and extragalactic distance measurements.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVIII: Detecting strongly lensed SNe Ia from time series of multi-band LSST-like imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe), though rare, are exceptionally valuable probes for cosmology and astrophysics. Upcoming time-domain surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) offer a major opportunity to discover them in large numbers. Early identification is crucial for timely follow-up observations. We develop a deep learning pipeline to detect LSNe using multi-band, multi-epoch image cutouts. Our model is based on a 2D convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM2D) architecture, designed to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in time-series imaging data. Predictions are made after each observation in the time series, with accuracy improving as more data arrive. We train the model on realistic simulations derived from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, which closely matches LSST in depth and filters. This work focuses exclusively on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). LSNe Ia are injected onto HSC luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at various phases of evolution to create positive examples. Negative examples include variable sources from HSC Transient Survey (including unclassified transients), and simulated unlensed SNe Ia in LRG and spiral galaxies. Our multi-band model shows rapid classification improvements during the initial few observations and quickly reaches high detection efficiency: at a fixed false-positive rate (FPR) of $0.01\%$, the true-positive rate (TPR) reaches $\gtrsim 60\%$ by the 7th observation and exceeds $\gtrsim 70\%$ by the 9th. Among the negative examples, SNe in LRGs remain the primary source of FPR, as they can resemble their lensed counterparts under certain conditions. The model detects quads more effectively than doubles and performs better on systems with larger image separations. Although trained and tested on HSC-like data, our approach applies to any cadenced imaging survey, particularly LSST.</description>

      <title>Infrared Variability of Carbon Stars in the LMC Observed with NEOWISE-R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the infrared variability of carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our sample consists of 11,134 carbon stars identified in both visual and infrared bands. Among these, 1,184 objects are known Mira variables based on the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment III (OGLE-III) observations. We study the infrared variability of the entire sample using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometric data spanning the past 16 years, including the AllWISE multiepoch data and the Near-Earth Object WISE Reactivation (NEOWISE-R) 2024 final data release. We generate light curves using WISE observations in the W1 and W2 bands and compute Lomb-Scargle periodograms for all sample stars. From the WISE light curves, we derive reliable variability parameters for 1,615 objects. Among these, we identify 672 objects exhibiting clear Mira-like variations: 445 of these are previously known Miras from OGLE-III, while 227 are candidates for new Mira variables identified from the WISE data. We establish period-magnitude and period-color relations in both visual and infrared bands for the known Miras and the newly identified candidates from WISE data. We anticipate that these relations will serve as valuable references for studying carbon stars in other galaxies, including the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Stretch to stretch, dust to dust: low-value local $H_{0}$ measurement from two-population modelling of type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the local Hubble constant measurement from type Ia supernovae calibrated with Cepheids (SH0ES) by remodelling the supernova data using two supernova populations emerging from the observed bimodal distribution of the SALT2 stretch parameter. Our analysis accounts for population differences in both intrinsic properties (related to possible initial conditions, including supernova progenitor channels) and host-galaxy extinction (expected from well-known environmental differences associated observationally with the two populations). Based on a two-population Bayesian hierarchical modelling of the SALT2 light-curve parameters from the Pantheon+ compilation, we simultaneously constrain intrinsic and extrinsic properties of both supernova populations, match probabilistically the calibration supernovae with the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, and derive the Hubble constant. The difference between the two supernova populations is primarily driven by their mean absolute magnitudes and total-to-selective extinction coefficients. This is related but not equivalent to the traditional mass-step correction (including its broadening for reddened supernovae). The mean extinction coefficient of the supernova population used to propagate distances from the calibration galaxies to the Hubble flow is found to be consistent with the Milky Way-like interstellar dust model with R_B~4 and substantially higher than the extinction model assumed in the SH0ES measurement. Allowing for possible differences between reddening in the calibration galaxies and the corresponding population in the Hubble flow, we obtain H_0=70.59+/-1.15 km/s/Mpc. For the most conservative choice assuming equal prior distributions, we find H_0=71.45+/-1.03 km/s/Mpc. Our reanalysis of type Ia supernovae results in a reduction of the discrepancy with the Planck H_0 by at least 30 and up to 50 per cent (3.5-2.2sigma).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimated radiative efficiency, spin and SMBH mass values for sample of 33 distant low luminosity AGNs. The distribution of the estimated spin values (majority of objects have a spin greater than 0.8) is fairly typical for many types of AGNs. The dependence of the estimated spin values on the estimated SMBH masses shows strong correlation between them, which suggests a rapid increase in spin with mass, i.e. that the main mechanism of mass growth in this case is disk accretion. We did not find any significant qualitative differences in the spin characteristics between our objects and objects of other types considered in the paper.</description>

Abstract: The presence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in low mass (Mstar $\lesssim$ $10^{9}$ Msun) galaxies at high redshift has been established, and it is important to characterise these objects and the impact of their feedback on the host galaxies. In this paper we apply the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code BEAGLE-AGN to SMACS S06355, a z $\sim$ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate from the JWST NIRSpec Early Release Observations. This object's spectrum includes a detection of the [NeIV]2426 line, indicating an obscured AGN due to its high ionization potential energy ($\sim$ 63eV). We use BEAGLE-AGN to simultaneously model the Narrow Line Region (NLR) AGN and star-forming galaxy contributions to the observed line fluxes and photometry. Having a high-ionization emission line allows the contribution of the NLR to the remaining lines to be probabilistically disentangled. The HII region metallicity is derived to be 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{HII}}$ = $7.82^{+0.18}_{-0.19}$. Assuming that the Neon-to-Oxygen abundance is similar to solar we derive a high NLR metallicity of 12+log(O/H)$^\mathrm{{NLR}}$ = $8.86^{+0.14}_{-0.16}$, with the 2$\sigma$ lower-limit extending to 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{NLR}}$ $\sim$ 8.54, showing the derivation is uncertain. We discuss this result with respect to non-solar Neon abundances that might boost the inferred NLR metallicity. The NLR metallicity places SMACS S06355 in a comparable region of the mass-metallicity plane to intermediate (1.5 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 3.0) redshift obscured AGN. Our derived accretion disc luminosity, log($L_{acc}$ / erg $s^{-1}$) = $45.19^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, is moderately high yet still uncertain. We highlight that deviations between bolometric luminosity calibrations and model grid tracks become enhanced at low metallicities.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Xu \&amp; Jing reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass $M_h$ and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S\'ersic index $n$, at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of $11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7$, using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on $n$, we confirm a positive correlation between $n$ and $M_h$, and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of $n$ and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between $M_h$ and $n$. Furthermore, using SIMBA simulations with different feedback mode, we find jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback might be related to the relationship of S\'ersic index and halo mass.</description>

      <title>The [C II] line emission as an interstellar medium probe in the MARIGOLD galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The [C II] fine-structure line at 157.74 $\mu$m is one of the brightest far-infrared emission lines and an important probe of galaxy properties like the star formation rate (SFR) and the molecular gas mass ($M_{\mathrm{mol}}$). Using high-resolution numerical simulations, we test the reliability of the [C II] line as a tracer of $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ in high-redshift galaxies and investigate secondary dependences of the [C II]-$M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ relation on the SFR and metallicity. We investigate the time evolution of the [C II] luminosity function (LF) and the relative spatial extent of [C II] emission and star formation. We post-process galaxies from the MARIGOLD simulations at redshifts $3 \le z \leq 7$ to obtain their [C II] emission. These simulations were performed with the sub-grid chemistry model, HYACINTH, to track the non-equilibrium abundances of $\mathrm{H_2}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\rm C$ and $\mathrm{C^+}$ on the fly. Based on a statistical sample of galaxies at these redshifts, we investigate correlations between the [C II] line luminosity, L([C II]), and the SFR, the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$, the total gas mass and the metal mass in gas phase ($M_{\mathrm{metal}}$). We find that accounting for secondary dependencies in the L([C II])-$M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ relation improves the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ prediction by a factor of 2.3. The [C II] emission in our simulated galaxies shows the tightest correlation with $M_{\mathrm{metal}}$. About 20% (10%) of our simulated galaxies at $z=5$ ($z=4$) have [C II] emission extending $\geq 2$ times farther than the star formation activity. The [C II] LF evolves rapidly and is always well approximated by a double power law that does not show an exponential cutoff at the bright end. We record a 600-fold increase in the number density of L([C II]) $\sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{L_{\odot}}$ emitters in 1.4 Gyr.</description>

      <title>The MALATANG survey: Dense gas distribution on sub-kiloparsec scales across the disk of M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey, combined with archival HCN J=1-0 and HCO^+ J=1-0 data from the Green Bank Telescope, to study the spatial distribution and excitation conditions of dense molecular gas in the disk of M82. We detect HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 emission within the central region (&lt; 500 pc) of the galaxy, while the J=1-0 emission lines exhibit a more extended spatial distribution (&gt; 700 pc). The dense gas shows a clear double-lobed structure in both spatial distribution and kinematics, with the HCN and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines in the southwest lobe blueshifted by ~ 40 km/s relative to the J=1-0 lines. The HCN J=4-3/1-0 and HCO^+ J=4-3/1-0 line-luminosity ratios range from 0.09 to 0.53 and from 0.14 to 0.87, respectively, with mean values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.36 +/- 0.06. The HCN ratio is lower than the typical average observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, whereas the HCO^+ ratio is comparatively higher, suggesting that the high-J HCN emission in M82 is significantly sub-thermally excited. Spatially, the peak values of the J=4-3/1-0 ratios are found in the northwest region of M82, coinciding with the galaxy-scale outflow. Elevated HCN/HCO^+ ratios are also detected in roughly the same area, potentially tracing local excitation enhancements driven by the outflow. The HCN/HCO^+ J=4-3 ratio across all detected regions ranges from 0.19 to 1.07 with a mean value of 0.41 +/- 0.11, which is significantly lower than the average J=1-0 ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.08. Both ratios are significantly lower than the average values observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, which could be related to the relatively low gas density and the presence of an extended photo-dissociation region in M82.</description>

      <title>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- III: Feeding and feedback in 3C 293 observed with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H$_2$2.12$\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\mu$m and Pa$\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component ($\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad outflow ($\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component ($\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$ values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 8 x 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 5.5 $\pm$ 1.44 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 4.5% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.</description>

      <title>Rapid follow-up observations of infant supernovae with the Gran Telescopio Canarias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first few hours of a supernova (SN) contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted on the Gran Telescopio Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernovae (SNe) at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra of 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48\,hr. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). This project shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme for existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the SN candidate.</description>

      <title>The Kaleidoscope Survey: Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters with Radial Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the dark matter density profiles of six galaxy clusters: A383, MS 2137-23, MACS J0326.8-0043, MACS J1427.6-2521, MACS J0417.5-1154, and MACS J0949.8+1708. Each cluster contains at least one radial arc, a unique physical feature that allows for more precise measurements of the inner mass profile (R &lt; 50 kpc) from strong lensing. We present the first strong lensing analysis for MACS J0326 and MACS J1427. We use a combination of HST imaging and VLT/MUSE observations from the ESO Kaleidoscope Clusters Survey, a large `filler' program, to identify and measure redshifts for multiply-imaged systems and obtain the 2-D stellar velocity dispersion for each centrally-located brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The BCG kinematics are used to subtract the baryonic mass component from the inner mass profile. We find total mass density profiles consistent with previous works using a combination of strong lensing and BCG kinematics. The overall shape of these profiles appears core-like, with an average dark matter slope measurement of $\gamma$~0.66. These results demonstrate the ongoing need for the construction of observational models for galaxy clusters, and show how galaxy-scale kinematics can be used to disentangle baryonic and dark matter concentrations in cluster cores.</description>
