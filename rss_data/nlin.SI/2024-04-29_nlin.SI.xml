      <title>Construction of a new (3 + 1)-dimensional KdV equation and its closed-form solutions with solitary wave behaviour and conserved vectors</title>

Abstract: This paper discusses the construction of a new $(3+1)$-dimensional Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. By employing the KdV's recursion operator, we extract two equations, and with elemental computation steps, the obtained result is $ 3u_{xyt}+3u_{xzt}-(u_{t}-6uu_{x}+u_{xxx})_{yz}-2\left(u_{x}\partial_{x}^{-1}u_{y}\right)_{xz}-2\left(u_{x}\partial_{x}^{-1}u_{z}\right)_{xy}=0 $. We then transform the new equation to a simpler one to avoid the appearance of the integral in the equation. Thereafter, we apply the Lie symmetry technique and gain a $7$-dimensional Lie algebra $L_7$ of point symmetries. The one-dimensional optimal system of Lie subalgebras is then computed and used in the reduction process to achieve seven exact solutions. These obtained solutions are graphically illustrated as 3D and 2D plots that show different propagations of solitary wave solutions such as breather, periodic, bell shape, and others. Finally, the conserved vectors are computed by invoking Ibragimov's method.</description>

      <title>Screwon spectral statistics and dispersion relation in the quantum Rajeev-Ranken model</title>

Abstract: The Rajeev-Ranken (RR) model is a Hamiltonian system describing screw-type nonlinear waves (screwons) of wavenumber $k$ in a scalar field theory pseudodual to the 1+1D SU(2) principal chiral model. Classically, the RR model based on a quadratic Hamiltonian on a nilpotent/Euclidean Poisson algebra is Liouville integrable. Upon adopting canonical variables in a slightly extended phase space, the model was interpreted as a novel 3D cylindrically symmetric quartic oscillator with a rotational energy. Here, we examine the spectral statistics and dispersion relation of quantized screwons via numerical diagonalization validated by variational and perturbative approximations. We also derive a semiclassical estimate for the cumulative level distribution which compares favorably with the one from numerical diagonalization. The spectrum shows level crossings typical of an integrable system. The $i^{\rm th}$ unfolded nearest neighbor spacings are found to follow Poisson statistics for small $i$. Nonoverlapping spacing ratios also indicate that successive spectral gaps are independently distributed. After displaying universal linear behavior over energy windows of short lengths, the spectral rigidity saturates at a length and value that scales with the square-root of energy. For strong coupling $\lambda$ and intermediate $k$, we argue that reduced screwon energies can depend only on the product $\lambda k$. Numerically, we find power law dependences on $\lambda$ and $k$ with an approximately common exponent $2/3$ provided the angular momentum quantum number $l$ is small compared to the number of nodes $n$ in the radial wavefunction. On the other hand, for the ground state $n = l = 0$, the common exponent becomes 1.</description>

      <title>SKdV, SmKdV flows and their supersymmetric gauge-Miura transformations</title>

Abstract: The construction of Integrable Hierarchies in terms of zero curvature representation provides a systematic construction for a series of integrable non-linear evolution equations (flows) which shares a common affine Lie algebraic structure. The integrable hierarchies are then classified in terms of a decomposition of the underlying affine Lie algebra $\hat {\cal{G}} $ into graded subspaces defined by a grading operator $Q$. In this paper we shall discuss explicitly the simplest case of the affine $\hat {sl}(2)$ Kac-Moody algebra within the principal gradation given rise to the KdV and mKdV hierarchies and extend to supersymmetric models.
  It is known that the positive mKdV sub-hierachy is associated to some positive odd graded abelian subalgebra with elements denoted by $E^{(2n+1)}$. Each of these elements in turn, defines a time evolution equation according to time $t=t_{2n+1}$. An interesting observation is that for negative grades, the zero curvature representation allows both, even or odd sub-hierarchies. In both cases, the flows are non-local leading to integro-differential equations. Whilst positive and negative odd sub-hierarchies admit zero vacuum solutions, the negative even admits strictly non-zero vacuum solutions. Soliton solutions can be constructed by gauge transforming the zero curvature from the vacuum into a non trivial configuration (dressing method).
  Inspired by the dressing transformation method, we have constructed a gauge-Miura transformation mapping mKdV into KdV flows. Interesting new results concerns the negative grade sector of the mKdV hierarchy in which a double degeneracy of flows (odd and its consecutive even) of mKdV are mapped into a single odd KdV flow. These results are extended to supersymmetric hierarchies based upon the affine $\hat {sl}(2,1)$ super-algebra.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Lie analogues of spin Sutherland models revisited</title>

Abstract: Some generalizations of spin Sutherland models descend from `master integrable systems' living on Heisenberg doubles of compact semisimple Lie groups. The master systems represent Poisson--Lie counterparts of the systems of free motion modeled on the respective cotangent bundles and their reduction relies on taking quotient with respect to a suitable conjugation action of the compact Lie group. We present an enhanced exposition of the reductions and prove rigorously for the first time that the reduced systems possess the property of degenerate integrability on the dense open subset of the Poisson quotient space corresponding to the principal orbit type for the pertinent group action. After restriction to a smaller dense open subset, degenerate integrability on the generic symplectic leaves is demonstrated as well. The paper also contains a novel description of the reduced Poisson structure and a careful elaboration of the scaling limit whereby our reduced systems turn into the spin Sutherland models.</description>
