      <title>Nonlinear Stacked Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances, while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Communication in a Fractional World: MIMO MC-OTFS Precoder Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology, rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates high mobility MIMO communication.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Multipoint Transmission in Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to conventional CoMP systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects), and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as overdrive level.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Spectral Regression for Cocoa Bean Physicochemical Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content, polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale. This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives. Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties, and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa production chain.</description>

      <title>LEO Downlink Channel Model Revisited: Scattering Geometry-Inspired Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new derivation of LEO-to-ground receiver channel model to address a clear gap in the prior art: the lack of an appropriate geometry aware characterization of non LOS (NLOS) link model represented by the power spectral density (PSD). Specifically, the main contribution is a coherent derivation of the PSD from 1st principles that is able to reproduce results in prior art and explain the causal relationship of main PSD features to the propagation geometry parameters.</description>

      <title>Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN (for group intent inference).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane, divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors, including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy. The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS assisted 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Localized Acoustic-Event Measurement Probe: Connector Confirmation Utilizing Acoustic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft, flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual interconnection process.</description>

      <title>PULSE: Privileged Knowledge Transfer from Electrodermal Activity to Low-Cost Sensors for Stress Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection, requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Sub-band Full-duplex Cell-free Massive MIMO JCAS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar) sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band. By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO JCAS systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancements in Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) have propelled the development of signal sensing and identification technologies in non-cooperative communication scenarios but also enable eavesdroppers to effectively intercept user signals in wireless communication environments. To protect user privacy in communication links, we have optimized the adversarial example generation model and introduced a novel framework for generating adversarial perturbations for transmitted signals. This framework implements dual-domain constraints in both the time and frequency domains, ensuring that the adversarial perturbation cannot be filtered out. Comparative experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method and the concealment of the adversarial examples it generates.</description>

      <title>Pilot Distortion Design for ToA Obfuscation in Uplink OFDM Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level. The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity (dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot. Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA observability under communication constraints.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming for Multi-user Multi-target FD ISAC System: A Hybrid GRQ-GA Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies. We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then, the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA). The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature. Additionally, it offers insights into sensing performance effects on beam patterns as well as communicationsensing trade-offs in multi-target scenarios.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Design for UAV-Based Low-Altitude Wireless Networks in Unknown Environments: A Digital Twin-Assisted TD3 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Towards actionable hypotension prediction -- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening. Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML) models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting, overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP &lt; 65, AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger patients (&lt;53 years), those with higher BMI (&gt;32), and patients without comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension prediction systems.</description>

      <title>Achieving Constant-Envelope Waveform in CP-OFDMA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE) waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework. Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation. Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based CSI Prediction Framework for Channel Aging Mitigation in TDD 5G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI, leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM), ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in TDD 5G systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Wireless Transceivers: From Pilot-Efficient Channel Estimation to AI-Native 6G Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.</description>

      <title>Quality Coefficients for Interferometric Phase Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of distributed scatterers.</description>

      <title>Advanced Closed-Loop Method with Limited Feedback for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication, computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission from communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic sensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected sensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services, UE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target characteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results demonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving communication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics such as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption. These improvements underscore SSF's ability to deliver robust, low-overhead feedback and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional Wideband Digital Metasurface for Secure Electromagnetic Manipulation in S-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode. Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180 degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25 GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding. These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance in radar and wireless systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16620v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage, illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication, to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous ECG-PCG Acquisition System with Real-Time Burst-Adaptive Noise Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac auscultation is an essential clinical skill, requiring excellent hearing to distinguish subtle differences in timing and pitch of heart sounds. However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited. Existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either not real-time or are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The performance of the system is validated using real-world hospital noise datasets and recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the proposed algorithms achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and 30.32 dB, respectively. These results demonstrate the systems effectiveness in enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening, including noisy hospital environments typical of resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>EthVault: A Secure and Resource-Conscious FPGA-Based Ethereum Cold Wallet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating, storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA.</description>

      <title>Optimized Loudspeaker Panning for Adaptive Sound-Field Correction and Non-stationary Listening Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surround sound systems commonly distribute loudspeakers along standardized layouts for multichannel audio reproduction. However in less controlled environments, practical layouts vary in loudspeaker quantity, placement, and listening locations / areas. Deviations from standard layouts introduce sound-field errors that degrade acoustic timbre, imaging, and clarity of audio content reproduction. This work introduces both Bayesian loudspeaker normalization and content panning optimization methods for sound-field correction. Conjugate prior distributions over loudspeaker-listener directions update estimated layouts for non-stationary listening locations; digital filters adapt loudspeaker acoustic responses to a common reference target at the estimated listening area without acoustic measurements. Frequency-domain panning coefficients are then optimized via sensitivity / efficiency objectives subject to spatial, electrical, and acoustic domain constraints; normalized and panned loudspeakers form virtual loudspeakers in standardized layouts for accurate multichannel reproduction. Experiments investigate robustness of Bayesian adaptation, and panning optimizations in practical applications.</description>

      <title>What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $\mathbf{e}$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A} x^* + \mathbf{e}$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing $x^*$-hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^*$-that is uniformly recoverable from $\mathbf{y}$ without knowing $\mathbf{e}$. While exact recovery of $x^*$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $\mathbf{A}$ or $x^*$ (for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $\mathbf{A}$ and $x^*$ remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^* + \ker(\mathbf{U})$, where $\mathbf{U}$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $\mathbf{A}$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A} x$ lies in $x^* + \ker(\mathbf{U})$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for health indicator extraction from guided waves in aerospace composite structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents (e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies, which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved 81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3% performance, outperforming existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Neural 3D Reconstruction Under Pose Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing neural implicit surfaces for 3D reconstruction using acoustic images collected with drifting sensor poses. The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Initialization Refinement in Code-Aided EM for Blind Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-known local maximum problem of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in blind intersymbol interference (ISI) channel estimation. This problem primarily results from phase and shift ambiguity during initialization, which blind estimation is inherently unable to distinguish. We propose an effective initialization refinement algorithm that utilizes the decoder output as a model selection metric, incorporating a technique to detect phase and shift ambiguity. Our results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of local maximum cases to nearly one-third for a 3-tap ISI channel under highly uncertain initial conditions. The improvement becomes more pronounced as initial errors increase and the channel memory grows. When used in a turbo equalizer, the proposed algorithm is required only in the first turbo iteration, which limits any complexity increase with subsequent iterations.</description>

      <title>A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.</description>

      <title>Passive Microwave Tag Classification Using RF Fingerprinting and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to identifying wireless microwave tags using radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting and machine learning. The tags are designed for low cost and simplicity, consisting of only two antennas and a single nonlinear element (a diode). An interrogating transceiver transmits a signal consisting of a set of individual frequency tones that is captured by the tag. The signal response of the diode is nonlinear, and can be represented by an infinite power series, the coefficients of which are similar but not identical for different physical diodes due to small manufacturing perturbations. The small differences in the signal responses manifest in the spectral signal response of the tag, which is retransmitted back to the interrogating transceiver. Input into machine learning algorithms, the slight differences in the spectral responses of the diodes can be used to uniquely identify devices. To demonstrate the concept, we designed 2.0 GHz tags consisting of patch antennas and a single diode, along with a bi-static radar system operating at the 2.0 GHz 802.11 Wi-Fi band transmitting multi-tone continuous wave signals representing common 802.11 training fields. The received signals were processed using a set of algorithms for comparison purposes. A real-time classification accuracy of 95% between two tags was achieved.</description>

      <title>RMD: Robust Modal Decomposition with Constrained Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modal decomposition techniques, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), have advanced time-frequency signal analysis since the early 21st century. These methods are generally classified into two categories: numerical optimization-based methods (EMD, VMD) and spectral decomposition methods (SSA) that consider the physical meaning of signals. The former can produce spurious modes due to the lack of physical constraints, while the latter is more sensitive to noise and struggles with nonlinear signals. Despite continuous improvements in these methods, a modal decomposition approach that effectively combines the strengths of both categories remains elusive. Thus, this paper proposes a Robust Modal Decomposition (RMD) method with constrained bandwidth, which preserves the intrinsic structure of the signal by mapping the time series into its trajectory-GRAM matrix in phase space. Moreover, the method incorporates bandwidth constraints during the decomposition process, enhancing noise resistance. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate its performance: on the synthetic dataset front, we focused on low-SNR sine wave separation tasks and nonlinear signal processing experiments to verify the ability of RMD to extract weak signals and handle nonlinear distortions; on real-world data, we tested it on a real-collected millimeter-wave micro-motion energy dataset to demonstrate its practical applicability in radar-related micro-motion signature analysis.

      <title>UniCrossFi: A Unified Framework For Cross-Domain Wi-Fi-based Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06328v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing systems are severely hindered by cross domain problem when deployed in unseen real-world environments. Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Rejection-Sampled Universal Quantization for Smaller Quantization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a randomized vector quantizer which has a smaller maximum error compared to all known lattice quantizers with the same entropy for dimensions 5, 6, ..., 48, and also has a smaller mean squared error compared to known lattice quantizers with the same entropy for dimensions 35, ..., 47, in the high resolution limit. Moreover, our randomized quantizer has a desirable property that the quantization error is always uniform over the ball and independent of the input. Our construction is based on applying rejection sampling on universal quantization, which allows us to shape the error distribution to be any continuous distribution, not only uniform distributions over basic cells of a lattice as in conventional dithered quantization. We also characterize the high SNR limit of one-shot channel simulation for any additive noise channel under a mild assumption (e.g., the AWGN channel), up to an additive constant of 1.45 bits.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D) communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Abstract: Room impulse responses are a core resource for dereverberation, robust speech recognition, source localization, and room acoustics estimation. We present RIR-Mega, a large collection of simulated RIRs described by a compact, machine friendly metadata schema and distributed with simple tools for validation and reuse. The dataset ships with a Hugging Face Datasets loader, scripts for metadata checks and checksums, and a reference regression baseline that predicts RT60 like targets from waveforms. On a train and validation split of 36,000 and 4,000 examples, a small Random Forest on lightweight time and spectral features reaches a mean absolute error near 0.013 s and a root mean square error near 0.022 s. We host a subset with 1,000 linear array RIRs and 3,000 circular array RIRs on Hugging Face for streaming and quick tests, and preserve the complete 50,000 RIR archive on Zenodo. The dataset and code are public to support reproducible studies.</description>

      <title>NeuroPilot: A Realtime Brain-Computer Interface system to enhance concentration of students in online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.</description>
