      <title>Encoding Semi-Directed Phylogenetic Networks with Quarnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are graphs that are used to represent evolutionary relationships between different taxa. They generalize phylogenetic trees since for example, unlike trees, they permit lineages to combine. Recently, there has been rising interest in semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed graphs in which certain lineage combination events are represented by directed edges coming together, whereas the remaining edges are left undirected. One reason to consider such networks is that it can be difficult to root a network using real data. In this paper, we consider the problem of when a semi-directed phylogenetic network is defined or encoded by the smaller networks that it induces on the $4$-leaf subsets of its leaf set. These smaller networks are called quarnets. We prove that semi-directed binary level-$2$ phylogenetic networks are encoded by their quarnets, but that this is not the case for level-$3$. In addition, we prove that the so-called blob tree of a semi-directed binary network, a tree that gives the coarse-grained structure of the network, is always encoded by the quarnets of the network.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing networks from simple and complex contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network scientists often use complex dynamic processes to describe network contagions, but tools for fitting contagion models typically assume simple dynamics. Here, we address this gap by developing a nonparametric method to reconstruct a network and dynamics from a series of node states, using a model that breaks the dichotomy between simple pairwise and complex neighborhood-based contagions. We then show that a network is more easily reconstructed when observed through the lens of complex contagions if it is dense or the dynamic saturates, and that simple contagions are better otherwise.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization in Computation &amp; Chemistry: Return to AlChemy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do complex adaptive systems, such as life, emerge from simple constituent parts? In the 1990s Walter Fontana and Leo Buss proposed a novel modeling approach to this question, based on a formal model of computation known as $\lambda$ calculus. The model demonstrated how simple rules, embedded in a combinatorially large space of possibilities, could yield complex, dynamically stable organizations, reminiscent of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we revisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over the past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the robustness of those results using the greater computing resources available today. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system, demonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility. Specifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently than previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse into trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily combined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the random generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of objects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on the results. Finally, we provide a constructive proof that shows how an extension of the model, based on typed $\lambda$ calculus, could simulate transitions between arbitrary states in any possible chemical reaction network, thus indicating a concrete connection between AlChemy and chemical reaction networks. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of AlChemy to self-organization in modern programming languages and quantitative approaches to the origin of life.</description>
