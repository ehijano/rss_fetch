      <title>Numerical Investigations on Dilute Cold Plasma Potential and Electron Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation results are presented to demonstrate electron temperature and electrical potential development in dilute and cold plasma development. The simulation method is a hybrid method which adopted fluid model for electrons due to their high mobility, while heavy ions and neutrals are modelled with the direct simulation Monte Carlo and Particle-In-Cell methods. The flows include steady, starting-up and shutting-down scenarios. The goal is to illustrate the exponential behaviors which were predicted in several recently developed formulas. Those formulas include many coefficients related with local properties, and they are difficult to determine. Hence, those trends can only efficiently demonstrate by numerical simulations which are more convenient than experimental measurements. The results confirm several facts. For steady plasma flows, the electron temperature and potential profiles are smooth, very likely, they can be approximated with exponential functions. For unsteady flows, the property developing trends in the shutting down or starting-up processes change monotonically. Further, at locations with large gradients, the property change trends are less ideal than those formulas. This is consistent with the assumptions with which those formulas were developed.</description>

      <title>On turbulent magnetic reconnection: fast and slow mean steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a model of turbulent magnetic reconnection introduced by Yokoi and collaborators (Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 255001) and show that the classic two-dimensional, steady-state Sweet-Parker and Petschek reconnection solutions are supported. We present evidence that these are the only two steady-state reconnection solutions, and we determine the criterion for their selection. Sweet-Parker reconnection occurs when there is no growth in turbulent energy, whereas Petschek reconnection occurs when the current density in the reconnecting current sheet is able to surpass a critical value, allowing for the growth of turbulent energy that creates the diffusion region. Further, we show that the Petschek solutions are self-similar, depending on the value of the turbulent time scale. The self-consistent development of Petschek reconnection through turbulence, within the model, is an example of fast and steady magnetic reconnection without an explicit need for the collisionless terms in an extended Ohm's law.</description>

      <title>Kink instability of flux ropes in partially-ionised plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the solar atmosphere, flux ropes are subject to current driven instabilities that are crucial in driving plasma eruptions, ejections and heating. A typical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) instability developing in flux ropes is the helical kink, which twists the flux rope axis. The growth of this instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, which can explain the formation of chromospheric jets and spicules, but its development has never been investigated in a partially-ionised plasma (PIP). Here we study the kink instability in PIP to understand how it develops in the solar chromosphere, where it is affected by charge-neutral interactions. Partial ionisation speeds up the onset of the non-linear phase of the instability, as the plasma $\beta$ of the isolated plasma is smaller than the total plasma $\beta$ of the bulk. The distribution of the released magnetic energy changes in fully and partially-ionised plasmas, with a larger increase of internal energy associated to the PIP cases. The temperature in PIP increases faster also due to heating terms from the two-fluid dynamics. PIP effects trigger the kink instability on shorter time scales, which is reflected in a more explosive chromospheric flux rope dynamics. These results are crucial to understand the dynamics of small-scale chromospheric structures - mini-filament eruptions - that this far have been largely neglected but could significantly contribute to chromospheric heating and jet formation.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that two prominent theories of ion heating in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas -- stochastic and quasi-linear heating -- represent similar physical processes in turbulence with different normalized cross helicities. To capture both, we propose a simple phenomenology based on the power in scales at which critically balanced fluctuations reach their smallest parallel scale. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as relevant to the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions were revealed based on Potential Learning (PL), and dependence of particular solar wind plasma density (NP) on moderate geomagnetic conditions was discussed. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity NP begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp ranges under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed (VX), and NP obtained from the 21-year OMNI solar wind database were used as the PL input parameters. PL extracted VX as the most significant parameter for the moderate Kp level under southward IMF conditions and NP is the second most influential parameter. Based on the examination of the statistical relationship between VX and NP under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp levels using the PL database, geomagnetic conditions remain high while NP becomes large, even if VX decreases (or remains similar). This shows that both VX and NP govern geomagnetic activity, following the relational equation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. Based on the relation between VX and NP clarified by PL and incidental statistical studies using PL input data, we also revealed that NP begins to affect the Kp level from moderate geomagnetic activity level. These results suggest that even under southward IMF conditions, the geomagnetic activity might be influenced by fast (slow) VX and low (high) NP. Our results would greatly help understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions, and forecast the geomagnetic activity under extreme solar wind conditions.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma Generated THz Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</description>

      <title>Ion acceleration from micrometric targets immersed in an intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of proton acceleration by intense laser irradiation of micrometric bar targets, whose dimensions are transversely immersed in the laser focal volume and longitudinally smaller than half its wavelength. Using only 120 mJ of laser energy, we recorded proton energies in excess of 6 MeV, exceeding those reported with any other experimental method by a factor of 3. 3D particle-in-cell simulations revealed that the efficient energy transfer from the diffracted laser fields to electrons on both sides of the target, combined with its reduced surface area, results in a thicker electron sheath and higher accelerating electric field gradients. We demonstrated numerically how this ion acceleration technique opens up the possibility of laser ion acceleration in multiple stages, allowing manipulation of the accelerated ion spectrum by optical means.</description>

      <title>Normal high velocity solid dust impacts on tiles of tokamak-relevant temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runaway electron incidence on plasma facing components triggers explosive events that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Subsequent dust-wall high speed impacts constitute a mechanism of wall damage and dust destruction. Empirical damage laws that can be employed for erosion estimates are based on room-temperature impact experiments. We use light-gas gun shooting systems to accelerate solid tungsten dust to near-supersonic speeds towards bulk tungsten targets that are maintained at different temperatures. This concerns targets cooled down to $-100^{\circ}$C with liquid nitrogen and targets resistively heated up to $400^{\circ}$C. Post-mortem surface analysis reveals that the three erosion regimes (plastic deformation, bonding, partial disintegration) weakly depend on the target temperature within the investigated range. It is concluded that empirical damage laws based on room-temperature measurements can be safely employed for predictions.</description>
