      <title>Pure many-body interactions in colloidal systems by artificial random light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to generate pure many-body interactions in colloidal systems by using optical forces induced by random optical fields with an optimized spectral energy density. To assess the feasibility in general settings, we develop a simple model for Lorentzian electric and magnetic dipole response. An optimization procedure is then introduced to design the spectral energy density of the random field that minimizes pair interactions at constant electromagnetic energy density. We conclude that, under rather general circumstances, it is possible to effectively cancel pair interactions within a range of distance. Hence a colloid can be driven to interact exclusively through many-body interactions</description>

      <title>Self-induced buckling in hollow microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollow microgels are elastic polymer shells easily realisable in experiments. Recent works have shown the emergence of buckling events in single hollow microgels under the effect of an added osmotic pressure. Here, we perform large-scale simulations to show that these microgels at high enough packing fractions undergo spontaneous symmetry-breaking deformations ranging from single large dents to multiple indentations, even in the absence of any externally applied stress. This buckling phenomenology is thus self-induced, solely driven by interparticle crowding. We construct a phase diagram inspired by vesicle shape theories, mapping local curvature metrics as a function of the reduced volume, to quantify these findings, and we also propose ways to observe the occurrence of buckling in experiments. The present results thus rationalise the deformations occurring in suspensions of micro- and nano-scale elastic shells, offering a synthetic analogue to biological ones, allowing direct control on buckling instabilities for potential applications. Beyond materials design, these insights may also shed light on shape regulation in natural systems such as cells and vesicles, where similar deformations are observed.</description>

      <title>Mixing of a binary passive particle system using smart active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled activity of active entities interacting with a passive environment can generate emergent system-level phenomena, positioning such systems as promising platforms for potential downstream applications in targeted drug delivery, adaptive and reconfigurable materials, microfluidic transport and related fields. The present work aims to realise an optimal mixing of two segregated species of passive particles by introducing a small fraction of active particles (2% by composition) with adaptive and intelligent behaviour, directed by a trained Artificial Neural Network-based agent. While conventional run-and-tumble particles can induce mixing in the system, the smart active particles demonstrate superior performance, achieving faster and more efficient mixing. Interestingly, an optimal mixing strategy doesn't involve a uniform dispersion of active particles in the domain, but rather limiting their motion to an eccentrically placed zone of activity, inducing a global rotational motion of the passive particles about the system centre. A transition in the directionality of the passive particles' motion is observed along the radius towards the centre, likening the active particles' motion to an ellipse-shaped void with a defined surface speed. Situated at the intersection of active matter and machine learning, this work highlights the potential of integrating adaptive learning frameworks into traditional active matter models.</description>

      <title>Spatially focused magnetic hyperthermia: comparison of MRSh and sLLG equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hyperthermia with metallic nanoparticles is a therapeutic strategy that relies on heating cancer cells to levels sufficient to damage or destroy them. After injection, the nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissues, where they transfer energy from the applied time-dependent magnetic field to the surrounding medium, thereby increasing the local temperature. This heating effect can be spatially focused (superlocalized) by combining AC and DC magnetic fields. Heat generation arises either from the rotation of the particle or from the rotation of its magnetic moment. The theoretical framework is provided by the Martsenyuk-Raikher-Shliomis (MRSh) equation for the former and the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) equation for the latter. However, by using the concept of magnetic and ordinary viscosity, the results of these approaches can be directly compared, which is our goal in this work, with special emphasis on their ability to achieve spatial localization. On the basis of this comparison, we propose the use of perpendicular AC and DC magnetic fields for image-guided thermal therapy with magnetic particle imaging.</description>

      <title>Dynamic micromagnetism a la Ericksen-Leslie, allowing the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of dissipative micromagnetics coupled to elasticity is developed, following the procedures of the Ericksen-Leslie theory of nematic liquid crystals allowing for angular momentum due to magnetization. An outcome is the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory coupled to material spin. A further power-less augmentation to the angular momentum of the theory with classical kinetic energy density is also considered, which allows for plausible approaches to model the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects within continuum mechanics, as well as hard magnetic soft materials treated as constrained polar materials within the overall framework.</description>

      <title>Twist dominates bending in the liquid crystal organization of bacteriophage DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA frequently adopts liquid-crystalline conformations in both cells and viruses. The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description of these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or cholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to dominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal modeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4, whose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase. We first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric layers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this geometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the elastic ratio $\alpha = K_3/K_2$. We find $\alpha \approx 0.0064$, indicating that twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this result, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and classify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with experimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity, topology, and observed genome organization.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium properties of strongly confined fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical-mechanical study of the equilibrium properties of fluids, starting from the knowledge of the interparticle interaction potential, is essential to understand the role that microscopic interaction between individual particles play in the properties of the fluid. The study of these properties from a fundamental point of view is therefore a central goal in condensed matter physics. These properties, however, might vary greatly when a fluid is confined to extremely narrow channels and, therefore, must be examined separately. This thesis investigates fluids in narrow pores, where particles are forced to stay in single-file formation and cannot pass one another. The resulting systems are highly anisotropic: motion is free along the channel axis but strongly restricted transversely. To quantify these effects, equilibrium properties of the confined fluids are compared with their bulk counterparts, exposing the role of dimensionality. We also develop a novel theoretical framework based on a mapping approach that converts single-file fluids with nearest-neighbor interactions into an equivalent one-dimensional mixture. This exact isomorphism delivers closed expressions for thermodynamic and structural quantities. It allows us to compute the anisotropic pressure tensor and revises definitions of spatial correlations to take into account spatial anisotropy. The theory is applied to hard-core, square-well, square-shoulder, and anisotropic hard-body models, revealing phenomena such as zigzag ordering and structural crossovers of spatial correlations. Analytical predictions are extensively validated against Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations (both original and from the literature), showing excellent agreement across the studied parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Robust Kirkwood-Buff inversion in complex mixtures via reciprocal-space methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties is a central challenge in the study of complex fluids. The Kirkwood-Buff (KB) theory offers an elegant and powerful framework for bridging this gap by relating integrals over pair correlation functions to measurable thermodynamic quantities. In multicomponent systems, KB integrals connect directly to derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, including chemical potentials derivatives, partial molar volumes, and isothermal compressibility. While several computational methods exist to estimate KB integrals from molecular simulations, their application often demands careful treatment of finite-size effects and explicit extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Recently, alternative strategies based on the analysis of partial structure factors in reciprocal space have been proposed. Unlike real-space approaches, reciprocal-space methods avoid the additional truncation artifacts associated with direct integration or fluctuations in subensemble. They evaluate density fluctuations across the entire simulation box, fully accounting for periodic boundary conditions rather than relying on subdomains. As a result, these methods offer a compelling alternative, providing enhanced numerical stability for estimating KB integrals in complex mixtures. In this work, we extend, compare and validate these methods using binary and quaternary Lennard-Jones mixtures, as well as realistic molecular systems such as hexane-ethanol, water-urea, and aqueous NaCl mixtures. Our results provide practical guidelines for computing KB integrals and associated thermodynamic properties from canonical ensemble simulations, including recommendations on reciprocal-space extrapolation, uncertainty estimation, and linear algebra formulations of thermodynamic derivatives.</description>

      <title>Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.</description>

      <title>A network-based approach to measure granule size distribution for discrete element modeling of granulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drum granulation is a size enlargement process where granular material is agitated with a liquid binder to form larger size granules. Discrete element modeling is increasingly being used to better understand and investigate the granulation process. However, unlike experiments the measurement of granule size within a DEM framework often necessitates an explicit quantitative definition of a granule and a corresponding granule identification method. In this work, we show that the existing definitions and the associated methods in literature are ineffective at identifying granules for dense flows such as during drum granulation. We propose an improved definition and granule identification method based on community-detection used in network science literature. The proposed method better identifies granules in a drum granulator as benchmarked against liquid-settling. We also vary granulation process parameters like liquid content and fill level and study their effect on the cumulative granule size distribution attained after drum granulation. We find that the existing granule-identification methods fail to reproduce the well-known effects of process parameters on the cumulative granule size distribution. The proposed method, based on community detection, reproduces the effects with better accuracy.</description>

      <title>Effect of ice nucleating proteins on the structure-property relationships of ice: A molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) are a unique class of biological macromolecules that catalyze the freezing of supercooled water far more efficiently than homogeneous nucleation. Their remarkable efficiency has motivated applications across diverse sectors, including agricultural frost protection, food processing and packaging, biomedical cryopreservation, and even strategies for mitigating glacier ice loss. The ice-nucleation performance of INPs and the mechanical behavior of the ice they produce depend strongly on their structural and biochemical characteristics. However, the links between INP properties, the resulting ice microstructure, and their mechanical behavior have yet to be systematically established. In this study, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations using the machine-learned ML-BOP potential are employed to investigate how varying INP densities influence the ice nucleation temperature, the resulting ice microstructure, and the mechanical behavior of the formed ice under creep tensile loading. We find that, depending on their density, INPs can significantly raise the ice nucleation rate while altering the grain structure of ice. Our simulations reveal that INP-assisted nucleation leads to faster stabilization of the resulting polycrystalline ice composed of hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic) as compared to nucleation in pure water. Moreover, higher INP densities and smaller ice grain sizes reduce the overall yield stress, while promoting diffusion-accommodated grain boundary sliding creep. These findings provide molecular-level insight into how INPs influence both the nucleation process and the mechanical behavior of ice, highlighting a pathway to engineer ice with tailored stability for real-world settings, including human activities and infrastructure in polar and icy environments.</description>

      <title>Field-Theoretic Simulation of Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics for Interacting Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formulation of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for interacting particles is a crucial step in the theoretical description of liquids. The microscopic mappings proposed decades ago by Dean and Kawasaki have played a central role in the analytical treatment of such problems. However, the singular mathematical nature of the density distributions used in these derivations raises concerns about the validity and practical utility of the resulting stochastic partial differential equations, particularly for direct numerical simulations. Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation. Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.</description>

      <title>Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive a field theory for the case of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from the microscopic particle dynamics, leading to a generic continuum model termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between nonreciprocity and competition of interparticle forces. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</description>

Abstract: Making use of the Griffith criticality condition recently introduced by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (Extreme Mechanics Letters 58: 101944, 2023), this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers. The results -- comprised of a combination of a parametric study and direct comparisons with experiments -- reveal how the non-Gaussian elasticity, the nonlinear viscosity, and the intrinsic fracture energy of elastomers interact and govern when fracture nucleates from the pre-existing crack in these tests. The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.</description>

Abstract: This article explores the hysteretic behavior and the damping features of sheared granular media using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We consider polydisperse non-cohesive frictional spherical particles, enclosed in a container with rigid but moving walls, submitted to a cyclic simple shear superimposed to a confining pressure. The mechanical response of the grains is analyzed in the permanent regime, by fitting the macroscopic stress-strain relation applied to the box with a Dahl-like elasto-frictional model. The influence of several parameters such as the amplitude of the strain, the confining pressure, the elasticity, the friction coefficient, the size and the number of particles are explored. We find that the fitted parameters of our macroscopic Ansatz qualitatively rely on both a well-established effective medium theory of confined granular media and a well-documented rheology of granular flow. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that the single degree-of-freedom elasto-frictional reduced model reliably describes the nonlinear response of the granular layer over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, we show that the mechanical response of a granular slab under simple shear depends on an unique dimensionless parameter, akin to an effective Coulomb threshold, at low shear/high pressure. Further, exploring higher shear/lower pressure, we evidence an optimal damping at the crossover between a loose unjammed regime and a dense elastic regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamic self-loops in networks of passive and active binary elements</title>

Abstract: Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches. Here we reveal that self-loops originate from energy injection and limit cycles in the underlying physical system. We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of intruders in a granular gas thermostatted by a bath of elastic hard spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boltzmann kinetic equation is considered to compute the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of intruders in a granular gas. Intruders and granular gas are immersed in a gas of elastic hard spheres (molecular gas). We assume that the granular particles are sufficiently rarefied so that the state of the molecular gas is not affected by the presence of the granular gas. Thus, the gas of elastic hard spheres can be considered as a thermostat (or bath) at a fixed temperature $T_g$. In the absence of spatial gradients, the system achieves a steady state where the temperature of the granular gas $T$ differs from that of the intruders $T_0$ (energy nonequipartition). Approximate theoretical predictions for the temperature ratio $T_0/T_g$ and the kurtosis $c_0$ associated with the intruders compare very well with Monte Carlo simulations for conditions of practical interest. For states close to the steady homogeneous state, the Boltzmann equation for the intruders is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in the spatial gradients. As expected, the diffusion transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the first-Sonine approximation. In dimensionless form, the transport coefficients are nonlinear functions of the mass and diameter ratios, the coefficients of restitution, and the (reduced) bath temperature. Interestingly, previous results derived from a suspension model based on an effective fluid-solid interaction force are recovered when $m/m_g\to \infty$ and $m_0/m_g\to \infty$, where $m$, $m_0$, and $m_g$ are the masses of the granular, intruders, and molecular gas particle, respectively. Finally, as an application of our results, thermal diffusion segregation is exhaustively analysed.</description>

      <title>Tuning Steady Shear Rheology through Active Dopants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the steady shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the steady shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Avalanches: Rate-Controlled Switching and Race Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Avalanches are rapid cascades of rearrangements driven by cooperative flipping of hysteretic local elements. Here we show that flipping dynamics and race conditions -- where multiple elements become unstable simultaneously -- give rise to dynamic avalanches that cannot be captured by static models of interacting elements. We realize dynamic avalanches in metamaterials with controlled flipping times, and demonstrate how this allows to modify, promote, and direct avalanche behavior. Our work elucidates the crucial role of internal dynamics in complex materials and introduces dynamic design principles for materializing targeted pathways and sequential functionalities.</description>

      <title>Casimir Interaction between Polydisperse Colloids Trapped at a Fluid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on fluctuation-induced interactions between colloids trapped at a fluid interface. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we calculate the interaction energy in two- and three-body systems under three mechanical boundary conditions. We find that size asymmetry can either suppress or enhance the many-body interaction compared to a monodisperse system, with the outcome depending on colloids mobility and separation. For fixed colloids, the interaction is suppressed at short separations but enhanced at large separations. In contrast, for mobile colloids, the interaction is predominantly enhanced at large distances but exhibits a competitive behavior in the near-field. This culminates in a large, multi-order-of-magnitude amplified sensitivity {to size asymmetry} for bobbing and tilting colloids at long range, highlighting a complex interplay between geometry and colloids mobility with significant implications for self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Confinement Reveals Hidden Splay-Bend Order in Twist-Bend Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using extensive Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate how spatial confinement affects molecular organization within thin films of the nematic twist-bend ($\mathrm{N_{TB}}$) phase. Our simulations show that confinement markedly amplifies the otherwise elusive splay-bend order, primarily by suppressing the intrinsic three-dimensional heliconical structure characteristic of bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$.
  Remarkably, when the $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is confined between parallel walls imposing planar anchoring, and the bulk wave vector is oriented parallel to the walls, a smectic splay-bend ($\mathrm{S_{SB}}$) phase spontaneously emerges near the confining surfaces. This intermediate structure subsequently transforms into the bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase either directly via a smectic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$) phase or through a sequence involving both the $\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$ and the nematic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$) phases. Notably, the $\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$ phase becomes particularly pronounced as the molecular bend angle approaches its maximum attainable value in bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$; this regime occurs in close proximity to the $\mathrm{N}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{A}}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{SB}}$ triple point on the bulk phase diagram.
  Our findings reveal a compelling and intricate interplay among chirality, confinement, and molecular ordering, further evidenced by the calculated elementary director distortions. Crucially, this study opens promising avenues for experimental exploration: confined thin-film geometries serve as powerful model systems for revealing and characterizing novel nematic and smectic liquid-crystal phases that remain elusive in, or currently inaccessible to, bulk experiments.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-filament dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.</description>
