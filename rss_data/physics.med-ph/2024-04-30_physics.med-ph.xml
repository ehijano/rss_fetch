      <title>Correcting directional dark-field x-ray imaging artefacts using position-dependent image deblurring and attenuation removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a novel x-ray imaging modality has emerged that reveals unresolved sample microstructure via a "dark-field image", which provides complementary information to conventional "bright-field" images, such as attenuation and phase-contrast modalities. This x-ray dark-field signal is produced by unresolved microstructures scattering the x-ray beam resulting in localised image blur. Dark-field retrieval techniques extract this blur to reconstruct a dark-field image. Unfortunately, the presence of non-dark-field blur such as source-size blur or the detector point-spread-function can affect the dark-field retrieval as they also blur the experimental image. In addition, dark-field images can be degraded by the artefacts induced by large intensity gradients from attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, particularly around sample edges. By measuring any non-dark-field blurring across the image plane and removing it from experimental images, as well as removing attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, we show that a directional dark-field image can be retrieved with fewer artefacts and more consistent quantitative measures. We present the details of these corrections and provide "before and after" directional dark-field images of samples imaged at a synchrotron source. This paper utilises single-grid directional dark-field imaging, but these corrections have the potential to be broadly applied to other x-ray imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>CConnect: Synergistic Convolutional Regularization for Cartesian T2* Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is fundamental for the assessment of many diseases, due to its excellent tissue contrast characterization. This is based on quantitative techniques, such as T1 , T2 , and T2* mapping. Quantitative MRI requires the acquisition of several contrast-weighed images followed by a fitting to an exponential model or dictionary matching, which results in undesirably long acquisition times. Undersampling reconstruction techniques are commonly employed to speed up the scan, with the drawback of introducing aliasing artifacts. However, most undersampling reconstruction techniques require long computational times or do not exploit redundancies across the different contrast-weighted images. This study introduces a new regularization technique to overcome aliasing artifacts, namely CConnect, which uses an innovative regularization term that leverages several trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to connect and exploit information across image contrasts in a latent space. We validate our method using in-vivo T2* mapping of the brain, with retrospective undersampling factors of 4, 5 and 6, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving reconstruction in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques. Comparisons against joint total variation, nuclear low rank and a deep learning (DL) de-aliasing post-processing method, with respect to structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics are presented.</description>

      <title>An automated pipeline for computation and analysis of functional ventilation and perfusion lung MRI with matrix pencil decomposition: TrueLung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce and evaluate TrueLung, an automated pipeline for computation and analysis of free-breathing and contrast-agent free pulmonary functional MRI.
  Material and Methods: time-resolved ultra-fast bSSFP acquisitions are transferred to TrueLung, which includes image quality checks, image registration, and computation of perfusion and ventilation maps with matrix pencil decomposition. Neural network whole-lung and lobar segmentations allow quantification of impaired relative perfusion (RQ) and fractional ventilation (RFV). TrueLung delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes, reported for clinicians in concise documents. We evaluated the pipeline in 75 cystic fibrosis children. Whole-lung and lobar segmentations were manually refined when necessary, and the impact on RQ and RFV was quantified.
  Results: Functional imaging was performed at 7.9 $\pm$ 1.8 (mean $\pm$ SD) coronal slice positions per patient, totaling on average 6min 20s scan time per patient. The whole pipeline required 20min calculation time per subject. TrueLung delivered the functional maps of all the subjects for radiological assessment. Quality controlling maps and segmentations lasted 1min 12s per patient. The automated segmentations and quantification of whole-lung defects were satisfying in 88% of patients (97% of slices) and the lobar quantification in 73% (93% of slices). The segmentations refinements required 16s per patient for the whole-lung, and 2min 10s for the lobe masks. The relative differences in RFV and RQ between fully-automated and manually refined data were marginal.
  Conclusions: TrueLung quickly delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes in an objective and standardized way, suitable for radiological and pneumological assessment with minimal manual input. TrueLung can be used for clinical research in cystic fibrosis and might be applied across various lung diseases.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and Robust Contrast in CEST MRI: Saturation Pulse Shape Design via Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To employ optimal control for the numerical design of CEST saturation pulses to maximize contrast and stability against $B_0$ inhomogeneities.
  Theory and Methods: We applied an optimal control framework for the design pulse shapes for CEST saturation pulse trains. The cost functional minimized both the pulse energy and the discrepancy between the corresponding CEST spectrum and the target spectrum based on a continuous RF pulse. The optimization is subject to hardware limitations. In measurements on a 7 T preclinical scanner, the optimal control pulses were compared to continuous-wave and Gaussian saturation methods. We conducted a comparison of the optimal control pulses were compared to with Gaussian, block pulse trains, and adiabatic spin-lock pulses.
  Results: The optimal control pulse train demonstrated saturation levels comparable to continuous-wave saturation and surpassed Gaussian saturation by up to 50 \% in phantom measurements. In phantom measurements at 3 T the optimized pulses not only showcased the highest CEST contrast, but also the highest stability against field inhomogeneities. In contrast, block pulse saturation resulted in severe artifacts. Dynamic Bloch-McConnell simulations were employed to identify the source of these artifacts, and underscore the $B_0$ robustness of the optimized pulses.
  Conclusion: In this work, it was shown that a substantial improvement in pulsed saturation CEST imaging can be achieved by using Optimal Control design principles. It is possible to overcome the sensitivity of saturation to B0 inhomogeneities while achieving CEST contrast close to continuous wave saturation.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Quality and Hallucination Assessment for Virtual Tissue Staining and Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential in the diagnosis of various diseases. The recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using AI alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in the traditional histochemical staining process, permitting multiplexed rapid staining of label-free tissue without using staining reagents, while also preserving tissue. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical utility of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images is generally performed by human experts, which can be subjective and depends on the training level of the expert. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method (termed AQuA), mainly designed for virtual tissue staining, while also being applicable to histochemical staining. AQuA achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to ground truth, also presenting an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists. Besides, AQuA achieves super-human performance in identifying realistic-looking, virtually stained hallucinatory images that would normally mislead human diagnosticians by deceiving them into diagnosing patients that never existed. We further demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained tissue images and showcase its strong external generalization to detect unseen hallucination patterns of virtual staining network models as well as artifacts observed in the traditional histochemical staining workflow. This framework creates new opportunities to enhance the reliability of virtual staining and will provide quality assurance for various image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.</description>

      <title>MRI lung lobe segmentation in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients using a recurrent neural network trained with publicly accessible CT datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce a widely applicable workflow for pulmonary lobe segmentation of MR images using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with chest computed tomography (CT) datasets. The feasibility is demonstrated for 2D coronal ultra-fast balanced steady-state free precession (ufSSFP) MRI.
  Methods: Lung lobes of 250 publicly accessible CT datasets of adults were segmented with an open-source CT-specific algorithm. To match 2D ufSSFP MRI data of pediatric patients, both CT data and segmentations were translated into pseudo-MR images, masked to suppress anatomy outside the lung. Network-1 was trained with pseudo-MR images and lobe segmentations, and applied to 1000 masked ufSSFP images to predict lobe segmentations. These outputs were directly used as targets to train Network-2 and Network-3 with non-masked ufSSFP data as inputs, and an additional whole-lung mask as input for Network-2. Network predictions were compared to reference manual lobe segmentations of ufSSFP data in twenty pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. Manual lobe segmentations were performed by splitting available whole-lung segmentations into lobes.
  Results: Network-1 was able to segment the lobes of ufSSFP images, and Network-2 and Network-3 further increased segmentation accuracy and robustness. The average all-lobe Dice similarity coefficients were 95.0$\pm$2.8 (mean$\pm$pooled SD [%]), 96.4$\pm$2.0, 93.0$\pm$2.0, and the average median Hausdorff distances were 6.1$\pm$0.9 (mean$\pm$SD [mm]), 5.3$\pm$1.1, 7.1$\pm$1.3, for Network-1, Network-2, and Network-3, respectively.
  Conclusions: RNN lung lobe segmentation of 2D ufSSFP imaging is feasible, in good agreement with manual segmentations. The proposed workflow might provide access to automated lobe segmentations for various lung MRI examinations and quantitative analyses.</description>

      <title>A new method of modeling the multi-stage decision-making process of CRT using machine learning with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. The purpose of this study is to create a multi-stage machine learning model to predict cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response for heart failure (HF) patients. This model exploits uncertainty quantification to recommend additional collection of single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI) variables if baseline clinical variables and features from electrocardiogram (ECG) are not sufficient. Methods. 218 patients who underwent rest-gated SPECT MPI were enrolled in this study. CRT response was defined as an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 5% at a 6+-1 month follow-up. A multi-stage ML model was created by combining two ensemble models: Ensemble 1 was trained with clinical variables and ECG; Ensemble 2 included Ensemble 1 plus SPECT MPI features. Uncertainty quantification from Ensemble 1 allowed for multi-stage decision-making to determine if the acquisition of SPECT data for a patient is necessary. The performance of the multi-stage model was compared with that of Ensemble models 1 and 2. Results. The response rate for CRT was 55.5% (n = 121) with overall male gender 61.0% (n = 133), an average age of 62.0+-11.8, and LVEF of 27.7+-11.0. The multi-stage model performed similarly to Ensemble 2 (which utilized the additional SPECT data) with AUC of 0.75 vs. 0.77, accuracy of 0.71 vs. 0.69, sensitivity of 0.70 vs. 0.72, and specificity 0.72 vs. 0.65, respectively. However, the multi-stage model only required SPECT MPI data for 52.7% of the patients across all folds. Conclusions. By using rule-based logic stemming from uncertainty quantification, the multi-stage model was able to reduce the need for additional SPECT MPI data acquisition without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>A New Family of High-Current Cyclotrons for Isotope Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are developing a high-current cyclotron as a driver for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment. It accelerates 5 mA H2+ to 60 MeV/amu, after which the electron is removed to produce a 10 mA, 60 MeV proton beam. The enabling innovations that offset space-charge effects occur at injection and in the first few turns, allowing one to construct cyclotrons with energies ranging from below 5 MeV up to 60 MeV/amu, or possibly higher, with the same performance for accelerated ions with Q/A = 0.5 (H2+, D+, He++, ...). In this paper, we discuss the possible uses of such cyclotrons for isotope production, including production of long-lived generator parents (68Ga, 44Ti, 82Sr,...), as well as intense fast neutron beams from deuteron breakup for (n,2n) production of isotopes like 225Ac.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Assessing Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors via Retinal Fundus Images: A Review of the Last Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods - in particular, deep learning (DL) - has been on the rise lately for the analysis of different CVD-related topics. The use of fundus images and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in the diagnosis of retinal diseases has also been extensively studied. To better understand heart function and anticipate changes based on microvascular characteristics and function, researchers are currently exploring the integration of AI with non-invasive retinal scanning. There is great potential to reduce the number of cardiovascular events and the financial strain on healthcare systems by utilizing AI-assisted early detection and prediction of cardiovascular diseases on a large scale. Method: A comprehensive search was conducted across various databases, including PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Sciences, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, using specific keywords related to cardiovascular diseases and artificial intelligence. Results: The study included 87 English-language publications selected for relevance, and additional references were considered. This paper provides an overview of the recent developments and difficulties in using artificial intelligence and retinal imaging to diagnose cardiovascular diseases. It provides insights for further exploration in this field. Conclusion: Researchers are trying to develop precise disease prognosis patterns in response to the aging population and the growing global burden of CVD. AI and deep learning are revolutionizing healthcare by potentially diagnosing multiple CVDs from a single retinal image. However, swifter adoption of these technologies in healthcare systems is required.</description>
