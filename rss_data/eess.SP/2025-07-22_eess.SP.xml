      <title>MSGM: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition struggles with capturing multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring computational efficiency for real-time applications. Existing methods often oversimplify temporal granularity and spatial hierarchies, limiting accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba (MSGM), a novel framework integrating multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling, and efficient fusion via the Mamba architecture. By segmenting EEG signals across diverse temporal scales and constructing global-local graphs with neuroanatomical priors, MSGM effectively captures fine-grained emotional fluctuations and hierarchical brain connectivity. A multi-depth Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and token embedding fusion module, paired with Mamba's state-space modeling, enable dynamic spatiotemporal interaction at linear complexity. Notably, with just one MSST-Mamba layer, MSGM surpasses leading methods in the field on the SEED, THU-EP, and FACED datasets, outperforming baselines in subject-independent emotion classification while achieving robust accuracy and millisecond-level inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Land-to-Ship Maritime Wireless Channels at 5.8 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime channel modeling is crucial for designing robust communication systems in marine environments, where factors like waves and wind impact signal propagation. This article investigates land-to-ship maritime wireless channel characteristics at 5.8 GHz based upon an extensive measurement campaign, with concurrent hydrological and meteorological information collection. First, a novel large-scale path loss model with physical foundation and high accuracy is proposed for dynamic marine environments. Then, we introduce the concept of sea-wave-induced fixed-point (SWIFT) fading, a peculiar phenomenon in maritime scenarios that captures the impact of sea surface fluctuations on received power. An enhanced two-ray model incorporating vessel rotational motion is propounded to simulate the SWIFT fading, showing good alignment with measured data, particularly for modest antenna movements. Next, the small-scale fading is studied by leveraging a variety of models including the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) and asymmetric Laplace distributions, with the latter performing well in most cases, while TWDP better captures bimodal fading in rough seas. Furthermore, maritime channel sparsity is examined via the Gini index and Rician $K$ factor, and temporal dispersion is characterized. The resulting channel models and parameter characteristics offer valuable insights for maritime wireless system design and deployment.</description>

      <title>Meta-Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Full-Duplex CF-DFRC Systems with Carrier Frequency Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By enabling spectrum sharing between radar and communication operations, the cell-free dual-functional radar-communication (CF-DFRC) system is a promising candidate to significantly improve spectrum efficiency in future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, in wideband scenarios, synchronization errors caused by carrier frequency offset (CFO) can severely reduce both communication capacity and sensing accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper integrates movable antennas (MAs) into the CF-DFRC framework, leveraging their spatial flexibility and adaptive beamforming to dynamically mitigate CFO-induced impairments. To fully exploit the advantages of MAs in wideband scenarios with CFO, we aim to maximize the worst-case sum-rate of communication and sensing by jointly optimizing MA positions, {beamforming}, and CFO parameters, subject to transmit power and MA positioning constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a robust meta reinforcement learning (MRL)-based two-stage alternating optimization strategy. In the first stage, we employ manifold optimization (MO) with penalty dual decomposition (PDD) to solve the CFO-robust worst-case subproblem. In the second stage, we adopt to jointly optimize {the MA positions and beamforming vectors} in a data-driven manner {for dynamic wireless environments}. Simulation results show that the proposed MRL approach significantly outperforms conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes in both communication and sensing performance under CFO impairments. Furthermore, compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the MA-aided CF-DFRC system exhibits</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming for Energy-Efficient STARS with Quantization and Element Selection in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STARS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in support of full-space energy-efficient data transmissions and target sensing. We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem jointly optimizing dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC)-empowered base station (BS) ISAC beamforming and STARS configurations of amplitudes, phase-shifts, quantization levels as well as element selection. Furthermore, relaxed/independent/coupled STARS are considered to examine architectural flexibility. To tackle the non-convex and mixed-integer problem, we propose a joint active-passive beamforming, quantization and element selection (AQUES) scheme based on alternating optimization: Lagrangian dual and Dinkelbach's transformation deals with fractions, whereas successive convex approximation (SCA) convexifies the problem; Penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework and penalty-based convex-concave programming (PCCP) procedure solves amplitude and phase-shifts; Heuristic search decides the quantization level; Integer relaxation deals with the element selection. Simulation results demonstrate that STARS-ISAC with the proposed AQUES scheme significantly enhances EE while meeting communication rates and sensing quality requirements. The coupled STARS further highlights its superior EE performance over independent and relaxed STARS thanks to its reduced hardware complexity. Moreover, AQUES outperforms existing configurations and benchmark methods in the open literature across various network parameters and deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Liquid Intelligent Metasurface for Fluid Antennas-Assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel liquid intelligent metasurface (LIM)-assisted downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, wherein both the base station (BS) and the metasurface are respectively equipped with fluid antennas (FA) and liquid elements. Unlike conventional reconfigurable metasurface-assisted systems with static geometries, the proposed architecture enables joint electromagnetic and spatial reconfigurability by allowing both the FA-empowered BS (FAS) and LIM to dynamically adjust their small-scale positions in addition to beamforming and phase-shift controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, LIM phase-shifts, and the positions of fluid antennas and liquid elements. The problem is highly non-convex due to coupling between variables, fractional expressions, unit-modulus constraints as well as spatial correlation functions. To address these challenges, we adopt alternating optimization and introduce auxiliary variables and employ successive convex approximation (SCA) as well as the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) to solve the respective subproblems. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed FAS-LIM architecture significantly outperforms benchmark methods employing conventional fixed metasurface and fixed antenna arrays in terms of various parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Latency Minimization Oriented Radio and Computation Resource Allocations for 6G V2X Networks with ISCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating mobile edge computing (MEC) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising technology to enable integrated sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) in the sixth generation (6G) networks. ISCC is particularly attractive for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, where vehicles perform ISAC to sense the environment and simultaneously offload the sensing data to roadside base stations (BSs) for remote processing. In this paper, we investigate a particular ISCC-enabled V2X system consisting of multiple multi-antenna BSs serving a set of single-antenna vehicles, in which the vehicles perform their respective ISAC operations (for simultaneous sensing and offloading to the associated BS) over orthogonal sub-bands. With the focus on fairly minimizing the sensing completion latency for vehicles while ensuring the detection probability constraints, we jointly optimize the allocations of radio resources (i.e., the sub-band allocation, transmit power control at vehicles, and receive beamforming at BSs) as well as computation resources at BS MEC servers. To solve the formulated complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm. In this algorithm, we determine the sub-band allocation via the branch-and-bound method, optimize the transmit power control via successive convex approximation (SCA), and derive the receive beamforming and computation resource allocation at BSs in closed form based on generalized Rayleigh entropy and fairness criteria, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint resource allocation design significantly reduces the maximum task completion latency among all vehicles. Furthermore, we also demonstrate several interesting trade-offs between the system performance and resource utilizations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid RISs for Simultaneous Tunable Reflections and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of smart wireless environments envisions dynamic programmable propagation of information-bearing signals through the deployment of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). Typical RIS implementations include metasurfaces with passive unit elements capable to reflect their incident waves in controllable ways. However, this solely reflective operation induces significant challenges in the RIS orchestration from the wireless network. For example, channel estimation, which is essential for coherent RIS-empowered wireless communications, is quite challenging with the available solely reflecting RIS designs. This chapter reviews the emerging concept of Hybrid Reflecting and Sensing RISs (HRISs), which enables metasurfaces to reflect the impinging signal in a controllable manner, while simultaneously sensing a portion of it. The sensing capability of HRISs facilitates various network management functionalities, including channel parameter estimation and localization, while, most importantly, giving rise to computationally autonomous and self-configuring RISs. The implementation details of HRISs are first presented, which are then followed by a convenient mathematical model for characterizing their dual functionality. Then, two indicative applications of HRISs are discussed, one for simultaneous communications and sensing and another that showcases their usefulness for estimating the individual channels in the uplink of a multi-user HRIS-empowered communication system. For both of these applications, performance evaluation results are included validating the role of HRISs for sensing as well as integrated sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks: Fundamental, Architecture, and State-of-the-Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology, Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have shown significant empowerment potential in the field of wireless networks due to advantages, such as noise resistance, training stability, controllability, and multimodal generation. Although there have been multiple studies focusing on GDMs for wireless networks, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on their technological evolution. Motivated by this, we systematically explore the application of GDMs in wireless networks. Firstly, starting from mathematical principles, we analyze technical advantages of GDMs and present six representative models. Furthermore, we propose the multi-layer wireless network architecture including sensing layer, transmission layer, application layer, and security plane. We also introduce the core mechanisms of GDM at each of the layers. Subsequently, we conduct a rigorous review on existing GDM-based schemes, with a focus on analyzing their innovative points, the role of GDMs, strengths, and weaknesses. Ultimately, we extract key challenges and provide potential solutions, with the aim of providing directional guidance for future research in this field.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a stop-band energy constraint for filters in orthogonal tunable wavelet units with a lattice structure, aimed at improving image classification and anomaly detection in CNNs, especially on texture-rich datasets. Integrated into ResNet-18, the method enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations, yielding accuracy gains of 2.48% on CIFAR-10 and 13.56% on the Describable Textures dataset. Similar improvements are observed in ResNet-34. On the MVTec hazelnut anomaly detection task, the proposed method achieves competitive results in both segmentation and detection, outperforming existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the first study to apply tunable wavelet units (UwUs) for 3D retinal layer segmentation from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes. To overcome the limitations of conventional max-pooling, we integrate three wavelet-based downsampling modules, OrthLattUwU, BiorthLattUwU, and LS-BiorthLattUwU, into a motion-corrected MGU-Net architecture. These modules use learnable lattice filter banks to preserve both low- and high-frequency features, enhancing spatial detail and structural consistency. Evaluated on the Jacobs Retina Center (JRC) OCT dataset, our framework shows significant improvement in accuracy and Dice score, particularly with LS-BiorthLattUwU, highlighting the benefits of tunable wavelet filters in volumetric medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>CHIMERA: Compressed Hybrid Intelligence for Twin-Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.</description>

      <title>DASPack: Controlled Data Compression for Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DASPack, a high-performance, open-source compression tool specifically designed for distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. As DAS becomes a key technology for real-time, high-density, and long-range monitoring in fields such as geophysics, infrastructure surveillance, and environmental sensing, the volume of collected data is rapidly increasing. Large-scale DAS deployments already generate hundreds of terabytes and are expected to increase in the coming years, making long-term storage a major challenge. Despite this urgent need, few compression methods have proven to be both practical and scalable in real-world scenarios. DASPack is a fully operational solution that consistently outperforms existing techniques for DAS data. It enables both controlled lossy and lossless compression by allowing users to choose the maximum absolute difference per datum between the original and compressed data. The compression pipeline combines wavelet transforms, linear predictive coding, and entropy coding to optimise efficiency. Our method achieves up to 3x file size reductions for strain and strain rate data in lossless mode across diverse datasets. In lossy mode, compression improves to 6x with near-perfect signal fidelity, and up to 10x is reached with acceptable signal degradation. It delivers fast throughput (100-200 MB/s using a single-thread and up to 750 MB/s using 8-threads), enabling real-time deployment even under high data rates. We validated its performance on 15 datasets from a variety of acquisition environments, demonstrating its speed, robustness, and broad applicability. DASPack provides a practical foundation for long-term, sustainable DAS data management in large-scale monitoring networks.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Latent Space Alignment for Semantic Channel Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step, and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum sensing agents.</description>

      <title>Active RISs: Modeling and Optimization</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-empowered communication has emerged as a transformative technology for next generation wireless networks, enabling the programmable shaping of the propagation environment. However, conventional RISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely attenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures, capable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter investigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active RISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single Power Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell level using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive mathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received signal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are derived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and amplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints. Regarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit cell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the derivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model. Furthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection coefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations, enabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can effectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE trade-offs compared to passive RISs. Finally, the trade-off between the available power budget and the number of active elements is examined, revealing that a higher number of active elements does not always lead to optimal performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-user uplink mobile edge computing (MEC) network, where the users offload partial tasks securely to an access point under the non-orthogonal multiple access policy with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) against a multi-antenna eavesdropper. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem of minimizing the total energy consumption subject to secure offloading requirement, and we build an efficient block coordinate descent framework to iteratively optimize the number of local computation bits and transmit power at the users, the RIS phase shifts, and the multi-user detection matrix at the access point. Specifically, we successively adopt successive convex approximation, semi-definite programming, and semidefinite relaxation to solve the problem with perfect eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), and we then employ S-procedure and penalty convex-concave to achieve robust design for the imperfect CSI case. We provide extensive numerical results to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We demonstrate that RIS plays a significant role in realizing a secure and energy-efficient MEC network, and deploying a well-designed RIS can save energy consumption by up to 60\% compared to that without RIS. We further reveal impacts of various key factors on the secrecy energy efficiency, including RIS element number and deployment position, user number, task scale and duration, and CSI imperfection.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, using statistical physics methods, asymptotic closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information for a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are presented. While nominally valid in the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation challenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More importantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The numerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need for their optimal placement.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the Doppler frequency shift caused by moving targets is one of the key objectives of Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, as it enables applications such as target classification, human activity recognition, and gait analysis. In practical scenarios, Doppler estimation is hindered by the movement of transmitter and receiver devices, and by the phase offsets caused by their clock asynchrony. Existing approaches have separately addressed these two aspects, either assuming clock-synchronous moving devices or asynchronous static ones. In fact, jointly tackling device motion and clock asynchrony is extremely challenging, as the Doppler shift from device movement differs for each propagation path and the phase offsets are time-varying. In this work, we present AsyMov, a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target and its velocity in ISAC setups featuring mobile and asynchronous devices. It leverages the channel impulse response at the receiver, by originally exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across propagation paths and the bistatic geometry, where the target Doppler and the device velocity are jointly estimated by a newly proposed alternating minimization algorithm. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with device velocity measurements obtained from onboard sensors (if available), for enhanced reliability. Here, AsyMov is thoroughly characterized by way of theory (Cram\'er-Rao bound), simulation and experiments, implementing it on an IEEE 802.11ay testbed and testing it on multiple setups, also including a moving human target. Numerical and experimental results show superior performance against state-of-the-art methods and are on par with scenarios featuring static ISAC devices.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-field and Far-field Localization with Holographic MIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its ability to precisely control wireless beams, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is expected to be a promising solution to achieve high-accuracy localization. However, as the scale of HMIMO increases to improve beam control capability, the corresponding near-field (NF) region expands, indicating that users may exist in both NF and far-field (FF) regions with different electromagnetic transmission characteristics. As a result, existing methods for pure NF or FF localization are no longer applicable. We consider a hybrid NF and FF localization scenario in this paper, where a base station (BS) locates multiple users in both NF and FF regions with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which is a low-cost implementation of HMIMO. In such a scenario, it is difficult to locate the users and optimize the RIS phase shifts because whether the location of the user is in the NF or FF region is unknown, and the channels of different users are coupled. To tackle this challenge, we propose a RIS-enabled localization method that searches the users in both NF and FF regions and tackles the coupling issue by jointly estimating all user locations. We derive the localization error bound by considering the channel coupling and propose an RIS phase shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the derived bound. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate the performance gain compared to pure NF and FF techniques.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-Field and Far-Field Localization with Multiple Holographic MIMO Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization using multiple base stations (BSs) has gained much attention for its advantage in localization accuracy. However, the performance of the multi-BS system suffers from its limited number of antennas. To solve the above issue, we propose to use reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) serving as antennas. Existing localization methods enabled by multiple RISs mainly focus on the far-field (FF) region of each RIS. As the scale of RIS increases, the near-field (NF) region of each RIS expands, where FF methods struggle to achieve high localization accuracy. In this letter, a hybrid NF and FF localization method aided by multiple RISs is proposed. In such scenarios, achieving user localization and RIS optimization becomes challenging due to the high complexity caused by the exhaustive search through all candidate locations to match the signals. Moreover, the interference from multiple RISs degrades the localization accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase localization method that first estimates the relative locations of the user to each RIS and fuses the results to obtain the estimation. This approach reduces the complexity by decreasing the number of candidate locations considered in each step. Also, we introduce a constraint in the RIS optimization problem that limits the sidelobe levels directed towards other RISs, effectively minimizing inter-RIS interference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Filter Spectra in CNN for Explainable Sleep Stage Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by globally explaining spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, we introduce a method to retrieve the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compare it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We evaluate our approach on the EEGNet and MSA-CNN models using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. Our findings show that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-derived spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are frequently degraded by noise, limiting their clinical reliability in both conventional and wearable settings. Existing methods for addressing ECG noise, relying on artifact classification or denoising, are constrained by annotation inconsistencies and poor generalizability. Here, we address these limitations by reframing ECG noise quantification as an anomaly detection task. We propose a diffusion-based framework trained to model the normative distribution of clean ECG signals, identifying deviations as noise without requiring explicit artifact labels. To robustly evaluate performance and mitigate label inconsistencies, we introduce a distribution-based metric using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$). Our model achieved a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308, outperforming the next-best method by over 48\%. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, facilitating the exclusion of noisy segments to improve diagnostic accuracy and support timely clinical intervention. This approach enhances real-time ECG monitoring and broadens ECG applicability in digital health technologies.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Fusion of IQ and FFT Spectrograms with AoA Features for GNSS Jammer Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving 73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable and personalized health monitoring.</description>

      <title>How Many Simultaneous Beamformers are Needed for Integrated Sensing and Communications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a downlink integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in which a base station employs linear beamforming to communicate to $K$ users, while simultaneously uses sensing beams to perform a sensing task of estimating $L$ real parameters. How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best performance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds on the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is measured in terms of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and communications performance is measured in terms of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires at most $K + \sqrt{\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the ability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling interference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes $\sqrt{K^2 + \frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound on the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task individually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the performance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the beamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \sqrt{d}$ and $\sqrt{K^2 + d}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and angles-of-arrival of $N_\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users, the bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in $N_\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When interference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization for the case of $N_\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two beamformers should be used; when $K \ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be used, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.</description>

      <title>miMamba: EEG-based Emotion Recognition with Multi-scale Inverted Mamba Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition holds significant potential in the field of brain-computer interfaces. A key challenge lies in extracting discriminative spatiotemporal features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing studies often rely on domain-specific time-frequency features and analyze temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics separately, neglecting the interaction between local-global relationships and spatiotemporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a novel network called Multi-Scale Inverted Mamba (MS-iMamba), which consists of Multi-Scale Temporal Blocks (MSTB) and Temporal-Spatial Fusion Blocks (TSFB). Specifically, MSTBs are designed to capture both local details and global temporal dependencies across different scale subsequences. The TSFBs, implemented with an inverted Mamba structure, focus on the interaction between dynamic temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics. The primary advantage of MS-iMamba lies in its ability to leverage reconstructed multi-scale EEG sequences, exploiting the interaction between temporal and spatial features without the need for domain-specific time-frequency feature extraction. Experimental results on the DEAP, DREAMER, and SEED datasets demonstrate that MS-iMamba achieves classification accuracies of 94.86%, 94.94%, and 91.36%, respectively, using only four-channel EEG signals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Backscatter communications is attractive for its low power requirements due to the lack of actively radiating components; however, commonly used devices are typically limited in range and functionality. Here, we design and demonstrate a backscatter device consisting of a flattened Luneburg lens combined with a spatially-tunable dynamic metasurface. Using quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO), we design a flattened, additively manufactured Luneburg lens that focuses incoming waves over a wide field-of-view onto its flattened focal plane. When a reflective surface is placed at the focal plane, the flattened Luneburg lens retroreflects, enabling long-range backscatter communications over an extremely large field-of-view ($\pm30\degree$) and bandwidth. The dynamic metasurface is designed to modulated the reflected phase across the S-band (2-4 GHz) with fine spatial control. Thus, when combined with the flattened Luneburg lens, the device is able to modulate the retroreflected signal to achieve backscatter communications. We experimentally demonstrate full phase control of the backscattered signal across a range of incidence angles, spatial multiplexing, and secure communications against eavesdroppers by actively suppressing or randomizing signals in unwanted directions. The metasurface-backed Luneburg lens device offers a low-power solution for long-range wireless networks with advanced capabilities.</description>
