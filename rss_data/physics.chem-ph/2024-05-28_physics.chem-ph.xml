      <title>The significance of fuzzy boundaries of the barrier regions in single-molecule measurements of failed barrier crossing attempts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experimental study reports on measuring the temporal duration and the spatial extent of failed attempts to cross an activation barrier (i.e., "loops") for a folding transition in a single molecule and for a Brownian particle trapped within a bistable potential. Within the model of diffusive dynamics, however, both of these quantities are, on the average, exactly zero because of the recrossings of the barrier region boundary. That is, an observer endowed with infinite spatial and temporal resolution would find that finite loops do not exist (or, more precisely, form a set of measure zero). Here we develop a description of the experiment that takes finite experimental resolution into account and show how the experimental uncertainty of localizing the point, in time and space, where the barrier is crossed leads to observable distributions of loop times and sizes. Although these distributions generally depend on the experimental resolution, this dependence, in certain cases, may amount to a simple resolution-dependent factor and thus the experiments do probe inherent properties of barrier crossing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Molecular Structure and Rotational Dynamics in the Acetonitrile:Acetylene (1:2) Plastic Co-Crystal at Titan Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface of Saturn's moon Titan is coated with small molecule organic solids termed cryominerals. Cryominerals play an analogous role to minerals on Earth in Titan's surface geology and geochemistry. To develop a predictive understanding of Titan's surface geochemistry, we need to characterize the structure and dynamics of cryominerals at the molecular scale. We use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the structure and dynamics of the acetonitrile:acetylene (1:2) co-crystal at Titan surface conditions. We suggest that acetonitrile:acetylene is in a plastic phase, in which acetonitrile molecules are dynamically disordered about the N-C-C axis on sub-picosecond timescales, and that this rotational, plastic disorder persists at least to temperatures of 30 K. We anticipate that many cryominerals may have plastic phases at or near Titan surface conditions, and understanding this disorder will be crucial to predicting chemistry on Titan's surface.</description>

      <title>Water at negative pressure: Nuclear quantum effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various condensed phases of water, spanning from the liquid state to multiple ice phases, have been systematically investigated under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature to delineate their stability boundaries. This study focuses on probing the mechanical stability of liquid water through path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, employing the q-TIP4P/F potential to model interatomic interactions in flexible water molecules. Temperature and pressure conditions ranging from 250 to 375 K and -0.3 to 1 GPa, respectively, are considered. This comprehensive approach enables a thorough exploration of nuclear quantum effects on various physical properties of water through direct comparisons with classical molecular dynamics results employing the same potential model. Key properties such as molar volume, intramolecular bond length, H--O--H angle, internal and kinetic energy are analyzed, with a specific focus on the effect of tensile stress. Particular attention is devoted to the liquid-gas spinodal pressure, representing the limit of mechanical stability for the liquid phase, at several temperatures. The quantum simulations reveal a spinodal pressure for water of -286 and -236 MPa at temperatures of 250 and 300 K, respectively. At these temperatures, the discernible shifts induced by nuclear quantum motion are quantified at 15 and 10 MPa, respectively. These findings contribute valuable insights into the interplay of quantum effects on the stability of liquid water under diverse thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Computing hydration free energies of small molecules with first principles accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free energies play a central role in characterising the behaviour of chemical systems and are among the most important quantities that can be calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy of hydration in particular is a well-studied physicochemical property of drug-like molecules and is commonly used to assess and optimise the accuracy of nonbonded parameters in empirical forcefields, and as a fast-to-compute surrogate of performance for protein-ligand binding free energy estimation. Machine learned potentials (MLPs) show great promise as more accurate alternatives to empirical forcefields, but are not readily decomposed into physically motivated functional forms, which has thus far rendered them incompatible with standard alchemical free energy methods that manipulate individual pairwise interaction terms. However, since the accuracy of free energy calculations is highly sensitive to the forcefield, this is a key area in which MLPs have the potential to address the shortcomings of empirical forcefields. In this work, we introduce an efficient alchemical free energy method compatible with MLPs, enabling, for the first time, calculations of biomolecular free energy with \textit{ab initio} accuracy. Using a pretrained, transferrable, alchemically equipped MACE model, we demonstrate sub-chemical accuracy for the hydration free energies of organic molecules.</description>

      <title>The influence of solvent on surface adsorption and desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption and desorption of reactants and products from a solid surface is essential for achieving sustained surface chemical reactions. At a liquid-solid interface, these processes can involve the collective reorganization of interfacial solvent molecules in order to accommodate the adsorbing or desorbing species. Identifying the role of solvent in adsorption and desorption is important for advancing our understanding of surface chemical rates and mechanisms and for enabling the rational design and optimization of surface chemical systems. In this manuscript we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulation and transition path sampling to identify water's role in the desorption of CO from a Pt(100) surface in contact with liquid water. We demonstrate that the solvation of CO, as quantified by the water coordination number, is an essential component of the desorption reaction coordinate. We use meta dynamics to compute the desorption free energy surface and conclude based on its features that desorption proceeds via a two-step mechanism whereby the final detachment of CO from the surface is preceded by the formation of a nascent solvation shell.</description>

      <title>Fine Tuning of the Rotational Rate of Light-Driven, Second Generation Molecular Motors by Fluorine Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation time of several second generation molecular motors is analysed by calculating the minimum energy path between the metastable and stable states and evaluating the transition rate within harmonic transition state theory based on energetics obtained from density functional theory. Comparison with published experimental data shows remarkably good agreement and demonstrates the predictive capability of the theoretical approach. While previous measurements by Feringa and coworkers [Chem.\,Eur.\,J.\,(2017) 23, 6643] have shown that a replacement of the stereogenic hydrogen by a fluorine atom increases the relaxation time because of destabilization of the transition state for the thermal helix inversion, we find that a replacement of CH$_3$ by a CF$_3$ group at the same site shortens the relaxation time because of elevated energy of the metastable state without a significant shift in the transition state energy. Since these two fluorine substitutions have an opposite effect on the relaxation time, the two combined can provide a way to fine tune the rotational speed of a molecular motor.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Generalization of the Perdew-Zunger Self-Interaction Correction: a Way Out of Multiple Minima and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) is an established tool to correct unphysical behavior in density functional approximations. Yet, PZ-SIC is well-known to sometimes break molecular symmetries. An example of this is the benzene molecule, for which PZ-SIC predicts a symmetry-broken electron density and molecular geometry, since the method does not describe the two possible Kekul\'e structures on an even footing, leading to local minima [Lehtola et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3195]. PZ-SIC is often implemented with Fermi-L\"owdin orbitals (FLOs), yielding the FLO-SIC method, which likewise has issues with symmetry breaking and local minima [Trepte et al, J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 155, 224109].
  In this work, we propose a generalization of PZ-SIC - the ensemble PZ-SIC (E-PZ-SIC) method - which shares the asymptotic computational scaling of PZ-SIC (albeit with an additional prefactor). E-PZ-SIC is straightforwardly applicable to various molecules, merely requiring one to average the self-interaction correction over all possible Kekul\'e structures, in line with chemical intuition. We showcase the implementation of E-PZ-SIC with FLOs, as the resulting E-FLO-SIC method is easy to realize on top of an existing implementation of FLO-SIC. We show that E-FLO-SIC indeed eliminates symmetry breaking, reproducing a symmetric electron density and molecular geometry for benzene. The ensemble approach suggested herein could also be employed within locally scaled variants of PZ-SIC and their FLO-SIC versions.</description>

      <title>A physics-inspired evolutionary machine learning method: from the Schr\"odinger equation to an orbital-free-DFT kinetic energy functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) supervised model function that is inspired by the variational principle of physics. This ML hypothesis evolutionary method, termed ML-Omega, allows us to go from data to differential equation(s) underlying the physical (chemical, engineering, etc.) phenomena the data are derived from. The fundamental equations of physics can be derived from this ML-Omega evolutionary method when provided the proper training data. By training the ML-Omega model function with only three hydrogen-like atom energies, the method can find Schr\"odinger's exact functional and, from it, Schr\"odinger's fundamental equation. Then, in the field of density functional theory (DFT), when the model function is trained with the energies from the known Thomas-Fermi (TF) formula E = -0.7687Z^7/3, it correctly finds the exact TF functional. Finally, the method is applied to find a local orbital-free (OF) functional expression of the independent electron kinetic energy functional Ts based on the gamma-TF-lambda-vW model. By considering the theoretical energies of only 5 atoms (He, Be, Ne, Mg, Ar) as the training set, the evolutionary ML-Omega method finds an ML-Omega-OF-DFT local Ts functional (gamma-TF-lambda-vW (0.964, 1/4)) that outperforms all the OF- DFT functionals of a representative group. Moreover, our ML-Omega-OF functional overcomes the LDA's and some local GGA-DFT's functionals' difficulty to describe the stretched bond region at the correct spin configuration of diatomic molecules. Although our evolutionary ML-Omega model function can work without an explicit prior-form functional, by using the techniques of symbolic regression, in this work we exploit prior-form functional expressions to make the training process faster in the example problems presented here.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics in a non-equilibrium regime: Application to Stirling engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a thermodynamic theory in the non-equilibrium regime by extending a theory based on the dimensionless (DL) minimum work principle previously developed for a thermodynamic system-bath model [S.Koyanagi and Y.Tanimura,J.Chem.Phys.160,(2024)]. Our results are described by non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials expressed in time-derivative form in terms of extensive and intensive variables. This is made possible through the incorporation of waste heat, which is equivalent to the loss work consumed by the bath, into the definitions of thermodynamic potentials in a non-equilibrium regime. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Our results are verified numerically by simulating a Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal and two thermostatic processes using the quantum Fokker-Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that any thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the strain-induced softening behaviour in hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Usually, the strain-induced softening behaviour observed in the differential modulus $K(T,\gamma)$ of hydrogels has been attributed to the breakage of internal structures of the network, such as the cross-links that bind together the polymer chains. Here we consider a stress-strain relationship that we have recently derived from a coarse-grained model to demonstrate that no rupture of the network is needed for rubber-like gels to present such behaviour. In particular, we show that, in some cases, the decreasing of $K(T,\gamma)$ as a function of the strain $\gamma$ is closely related to the energy-related contribution to the elastic modulus that has been experimentally observed, e.g., for tetra-PEG hydrogels. Thus, our results suggest that, instead of the breakage of structures, the softening behaviour can be also related to the effective interaction between the chains in the network and their neighbouring solvent molecules. Comparison to experimental data determined for several hydrogels is included to illustrate that behaviour and to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Understanding and exploiting interfacial interactions between phosphonic acid functional groups and co-evaporated perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial engineering has fueled recent development of p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PSCs), with self-assembled monolayer-based hole-transport layers (SAM-HTLs) enabling almost lossless contacts for solution-processed PSCs, resulting in the highest achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) to date. Substrate interfaces are particularly crucial for the growth and quality of co-evaporated PSCs. However, adoption of SAM-HTLs for co-evaporated perovskite absorbers is complicated by the underexplored interaction of such perovskites with phosphonic acid functional groups. In this work, we highlight how exposed phosphonic acid functional groups impact the initial phase and final bulk crystal structures of co-evaporated perovskites and their resultant PCE. The explored surface interaction is mediated by hydrogen bonding with interfacial iodine, leading to increased formamidinium iodide adsorption, persistent changes in perovskite structure, and stabilization of bulk {\alpha}-FAPbI3, hypothesized as being due to kinetic trapping. Our results highlight the potential of exploiting substrates to increase control of co-evaporated perovskite growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perturbation approach to calculate the short-time propagator, or transition density, of the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, to in principle arbitrary order in the time increment. Our approach preserves probability exactly and allows us to evaluate expectation values of analytical observables to in principle arbitrary accuracy; to showcase this, we derive perturbation expansions for the moments of the spatial increment, the finite-time Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and the mean medium entropy production rate. For an explicit multiplicative-noise system with available analytical solution, we validate all our perturbative results. Throughout, we compare our perturbative results to those obtained from the widely used Gaussian approximation of the short-time propagator; we demonstrate that this Gaussian propagator leads to errors that can be many orders of magnitude larger than those resulting from our perturbation approach. Potential applications of our results include parametrizing diffusive stochastic dynamics from observed time series, and sampling path spaces of stochastic trajectories numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Neural-network Quantum States (NQS) has significantly advanced wave function ansatz research, sparking a resurgence in orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC) exploration. This work introduces three algorithmic enhancements to reduce computational demands of VMC optimization using NQS: an adaptive learning rate algorithm, constrained optimization, and block optimization. We evaluate the refined algorithm on complex multireference bond stretches of $\rm H_2O$ and $\rm N_2$ within the cc-pVDZ basis set and calculate the ground-state energy of the strongly correlated chromium dimer ($\rm Cr_2$) in the Ahlrichs SV basis set. Our results achieve superior accuracy compared to coupled cluster theory at a relatively modest CPU cost. This work demonstrates how to enhance optimization efficiency and robustness using these strategies, opening a new path to optimize large-scale Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-based NQS more effectively and marking a substantial advancement in NQS's practical quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm that leverages stochastic sampling techniques to compute the perturbative triples correction in the coupled-cluster (CC) framework. By combining elements of randomness and determinism, our algorithm achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and computational cost. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it allows for the calculation to be stopped at any time, providing an unbiased estimate, with a statistical error that goes to zero as the exact calculation is approached. We provide evidence that our semi-stochastic algorithm achieves substantial computational savings compared to traditional deterministic methods. Specifically, we demonstrate that a precision of 0.5 millihartree can be attained with only 10\% of the computational effort required by the full calculation. This work opens up new avenues for efficient and accurate computations, enabling investigations of complex molecular systems that were previously computationally prohibitive.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is crucial across diverse scientific fields, revealing detailed structural information, electronic properties, and molecular dynamic insights. Accurate prediction of NMR peaks in a spectrum from molecular structures allows chemists to effectively evaluate candidate structures by comparing predictions with experimental shifts in an NMR spectra. This process facilitates peak assignments, thereby aiding in verifying molecular structures or identifying discrepancies. Although significant progress has been made in predicting 1D NMR with Machine Learning (ML) approaches, 2D NMR prediction remains a challenge due to the lack of an annotated 2D NMR training dataset. To address this gap, we propose an Iterative Unsupervised Learning (IUL) approach to train a machine learning model for predicting atomic 2D NMR cross peaks and annotating peaks in experimental 2D NMR spectra. Initially, the model undergoes a Multi-Task pre-Training (MTT) phase using a set of annotated 1D 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Then, the model is iteratively improved through a fine-tuning process with IUL, alternating between using the model to annotate the unlabeled 2D NMR data and refining the model using the newly generated annotations. Using the proposed approach, we trained our model on 19,000 Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectra, tested it on 500 HSQC spectra with expert annotations, and further compared it with two traditional methods (ChemDraw and Mestrenova) on another expert-annotated HSQC dataset. For HSQC cross peak prediction, our model achieves MAE of 2.035 ppm and 0.163 ppm for 13C shifts and 1H shifts on the test dataset, respectively, and outperforms the conventional tools. This performance demonstrates not only the model's capability in accurately predicting chemical shifts, but also its effectiveness in peak assignments for experimental HSQC spectra.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning the Fisher--Widom line and the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility in simple fluids</title>

Abstract: In the statistical mechanics approach to liquid-state theory, understanding the role of the intermolecular potential in determining thermodynamic and structural properties is crucial. The Fisher--Widom (FW) line, which separates regions in the temperature vs density plane where the decay of the total correlation function is monotonic or oscillatory, provides insights into the dominance of the attractive or repulsive part of the interactions. Stopper et al. have recently conjectured [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{151}, 014501 (2019)] that the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility approximates the FW line in simple fluids. Here, we investigate this conjecture using the Jagla potential and also explore the line of vanishing excess pressure. We employ theoretical approximations and Monte Carlo simulations to study one-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. While exact results for the one-dimensional case do not support the conjecture, our Monte Carlo simulations for the three-dimensional fluid validate it. Our findings not only contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the three transition lines but also provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic and structural behaviour of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create and analyze new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for all time steps within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations.</description>
