      <title>Width-independent and Robust Multimode Interference Waveguides Based on Anomalous Bulk States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode interference (MMI) is a fundamental physical principle that plays a crucial role in modern communication technologies for wave splitting, filtering, switching and multiplexing. Typically, the generation of multimodes is highly dependent on the waveguide's cross-section, particularly its width, by which the mode profiles and the interference patterns can be severely affected, leading to unstable MMI performance. Here, we realize width-independent and robust MMI waveguides. Our principle is based on the unique properties of multilayer graphene lattices. By properly modulating the boundary potential, this Dirac-type material supports anomalous bulk states with uniform wavefunctions independent of the sample size. Benefited from such an anomaly, the bulk states in a waveguide formed by multiple layers of graphene ribbons exhibit width-independent MMI. Enabled by this intriguing characterisitc, we construct 2*2 MMI waveguides using bilayer photonic and phononic crystals with graphene lattices. By precisely modulating their boundaries, the anomalous bulk states and correspondingly the width-independent MMI are achieved. Our experimental measurements show that the input wave energy travelling through the MMI waveguide can be split into two outputs with a frequency-tunable ratio, and due to the width-independent characteristic, the splitter is robust to geometric perturbations. We further demonstrate stable MMI across multiple interconnects with stepped widths, allowing for high power capacity while maintaining high coupling efficiency. Our approach successfully decouples MMI performance from waveguide width, creating lateral degrees of freedom that enable flexibly scalable and robust photonic, phononic, and electronic integrated circuits for versatile MMI applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring lattice thermal conductivity models via interpretable deep learning to accelerate the discovery of novel materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum optics and squeezed light generation have revolutionized various fields of quantum science over the past three decades, with notable applications such as gravitational wave detection. Here, we extend the use of squeezed light to the realm of ultrafast quantum science. We demonstrate the generation of ultrafast, broadband quantum light pulses spanning 0.33 to 0.73 PHz using light field synthesizer and a four-wave mixing nonlinear process. Experimental results confirm that these pulses exhibit amplitude squeezing, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. This work lays the groundwork for a new field of ultrafast quantum science, enabling real-time studies of quantum light-matter interaction dynamics, which expect to reveal new physics. We also demonstrate the encoding of binary digital data onto these quantum light waveforms, synthesized with attosecond resolution, showcasing potential applications in secure quantum communication. This work paves the way for ultrafast quantum optoelectronics, quantum computing, and next-generation encrypted quantum communication networks, capable of achieving petahertz-scale data transmission speeds.</description>

      <title>A photonic integrated circuit for heterogeneous second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous integration of GaAs-based lasers with frequency doubling waveguides presents a clear path to scalable coherent sources in the so-called green gap, yet frequency doubling systems have so far relied on separately manufactured lasers to deliver enough power for second harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) which alleviates the performance requirements for integrated frequency doublers. Two gain sections are connected by waveguides, with a frequency converter and a wavelength separator in between. The fundamental light circulates between the gain sections until it is converted and emitted through the wavelength separator. Variants of this separated gain PIC are discussed, and the PIC is implemented with thin film lithium niobate and directly bonded GaAs-based lasers, coupled by on-chip facets and adiabatic tapers, realizing visible light generation in the 515-595 nm range.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-enhanced chemiluminescence vertical flow assay for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Democratizing biomarker testing at the point-of-care requires innovations that match laboratory-grade sensitivity and precision in an accessible format. Here, we demonstrate high-sensitivity detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) through innovations in chemiluminescence-based sensing, imaging, and deep learning-driven analysis. This chemiluminescence vertical flow assay (CL-VFA) enables rapid, low-cost, and precise quantification of cTnI, a key cardiac protein for assessing heart muscle damage and myocardial infarction. The CL-VFA integrates a user-friendly chemiluminescent paper-based sensor, a polymerized enzyme-based conjugate, a portable high-performance CL reader, and a neural network-based cTnI concentration inference algorithm. The CL-VFA measures cTnI over a broad dynamic range covering six orders of magnitude and operates with 50 uL of serum per test, delivering results in 25 min. This system achieves a detection limit of 0.16 pg/mL with an average coefficient of variation under 15%, surpassing traditional benchtop analyzers in sensitivity by an order of magnitude. In blinded validation, the computational CL-VFA accurately measured cTnI concentrations in patient samples, demonstrating a robust correlation against a clinical-grade FDA-cleared analyzer. These results highlight the potential of CL-VFA as a robust diagnostic tool for accessible, rapid cardiac biomarker testing that meets the needs of diverse healthcare settings, from emergency care to underserved regions.</description>

      <title>Verification of single-photon path entanglement using a nitrogen vacancy center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path entanglement is an essential resource for photonic quantum information processing, including in quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum sensing. In this work, we experimentally study the generation and verification of bipartite path-entangled states using single photons produced by a nitrogen-vacancy center within a nanodiamond. We perform a range of measurements to characterize the photons being generated and verify the presence of path entanglement. The experiment is performed using continuous-wave laser excitation and a novel state generation 'time-window' method. This approach to path entanglement verification is different to previous work as it does not make use of a pulsed laser excitation source.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for the frequency behavior of two distinct modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Tailored 1D/2D Van der Waals Heterostructures for Unified Analog and Digital Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a sequential two-step vapor deposition process for growing mixed-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, specifically Te nanowires (1D) and MoS$_2$ (2D), on a single SiO$_2$ wafer. Our growth technique offers a unique potential pathway to create large scale, high-quality, defect-free interfaces. The assembly of samples serves a twofold application: first, the as-prepared heterostructures (Te NW/MoS$_2$) provide insights into the atomically thin depletion region of a 1D/2D vdW diode, as revealed by electrical transport measurements and density functional theory-based quantum transport calculations. The charge transfer at the heterointerface is confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We also observe modulation of the rectification ratio with varying applied gate voltage. Second, the non-hybrid regions on the substrate, consisting of the as-grown individual Te nanowires and MoS$_2$ microstructures, are utilized to fabricate separate p- and n-FETs, respectively. Furthermore, the ionic liquid gating helps to realize low-power CMOS inverter and all basic logic gate operations using a pair of n- and p- field-effect transistors (FETs) on Si/SiO$_2$ platform. This approach also demonstrates the potential for unifying diode and CMOS circuits on a single platform, opening opportunities for integrated analog and digital electronics.</description>

      <title>Defect density of states of tin oxide and copper oxide p-type thin-film transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complete subgap defect density of states (DoS) is measured using the ultrabroadband (0.15 to 3.5 eV) photoconduction response from p-type thin-film transistors (TFTs) of tin oxide, SnO, and copper oxide, Cu$_2$O. The TFT photoconduction spectra clearly resolve all bandgaps that further show the presence of interfacial and oxidized minority phases. In tin oxide, the SnO majority phase has a small 0.68 eV bandgap enabling ambipolar or p-mode TFT operation. By contrast, in copper oxide TFTs, an oxidized minority phase with a 1.4 eV bandgap corresponding to CuO greatly reduces the channel hole mobility at the charge accumulation region. Three distinct subgap DoS peaks are resolved for the copper oxide TFT and are best ascribed to copper vacancies, oxygen-on-copper antisites, and oxygen interstitials. For tin oxide TFTs, five subgap DoS peaks are observed and are similarly linked to tin vacancies, oxygen vacancies, and oxygen interstitials. Unipolar p-type TFT is achieved in tin oxide only when the conduction band-edge defect density peak ascribed to oxygen interstitials is large enough to suppress any n-mode conduction. Near the valence band edge in both active channel materials, the metal vacancy peak densities determine the hole concentrations, which further simulate the observed TFT threshold voltages.</description>

      <title>Experimental Machine Learning with Classical and Quantum Data via NMR Quantum Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel methods map data into high-dimensional spaces, enabling linear algorithms to learn nonlinear functions without explicitly storing the feature vectors. Quantum kernel methods promise efficient learning by encoding feature maps into exponentially large Hilbert spaces inherent in quantum systems. In this work we implement quantum kernels on a 10-qubit star-topology register in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. We experimentally encode classical data in the evolution of multiple quantum coherence orders using data-dependent unitary transformations and then demonstrate one-dimensional regression and two-dimensional classification tasks. By extending the register to a double-layered star configuration, we propose an extended quantum kernel to handle non-parametrized operator inputs. By numerically simulating the extended quantum kernel, we show classification of entangling and nonentangling unitaries. These results confirm that quantum kernels exhibit strong capabilities in classical as well as quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

Abstract: We present a technique for integrating ultraclean carbon nanotubes into superconducting circuits, aiming to realize Josephson junctions based on one-dimensional elementary quantum conductors. This technique primarily involves depositing the nanotube in the final step, thus preserving it from the inherent contaminations of nanofabrication and maintaining contact solely with superconducting electrodes and a crystalline hBN substrate. Through transport measurements performed in both the normal and superconducting states, we demonstrate that our method yields high-quality junctions with Josephson energies suitable for quantum device applications, such as carbon nanotube-based superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>D-band MUTC Photodiode Module for Ultra-Wideband 160 Gbps Photonics-Assisted Fiber-THz Integrated Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.</description>
