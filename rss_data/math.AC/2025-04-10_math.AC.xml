      <title>Hermite Reciprocity and Self-Duality of Generalized Eagon-Northcott Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous examples of self-duality for generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes were given by computing the divisor class group for Hankel determinantal rings. We prove a new case of self-duality of generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes with input being a map defining a Koszul module with nice properties. This choice of Koszul module can be specialized to the Weyman module, which was used in a proof of the generic version of Green's conjecture. In this case, the proof uses a version of Hermite Reciprocity not previously defined in the literature.</description>

      <title>The v-numbers of Stanley-Reisner ideals from the viewpoint of Alexander dual complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express the v-number of the Stanley-Reisner ideal in terms of its Alexander dual complex and prove that the v-number of a cover ideal is just two less than the initial degree of the its syzygy module. We give some relation between the v-number of the Stanley-Reisner ideal and the Serre-depth of the quotient ring of the second symbolic power of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of its Alexander dual. We also show that the v-number of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a 2-pure simplicial complex is equal to the dimension of its Stanley-Reisner ring.</description>

      <title>Criteria for finite injective dimension of modules over a local ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We prove that the finiteness of the injective dimension of a finitely generated $R$-module $C$ is determined by the existence of a Cohen--Macaulay module $M$ that satisfies an inequality concerning multiplicity and type, together with the vanishing of finitely many Ext modules. As applications, we recover a result of Rahmani and Taherizadeh and provide sufficient conditions for a finitely generated $R$-module to have finite injective dimension.</description>

      <title>On the initial ideal of a generic artinian Gorenstein algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show that the initial ideal of the annihilator ideal of a generic form is generated by the largest possible monomials in each degree. We also show that the initial ideal with respect to the degree reverse lexicographical ordering of the annihilator ideal of the complete symmetric form has this property, by determining a minimal Gr\"obner basis of it. Moreover, we determine the total Betti numbers for a class of strongly stable monomial ideals and show that these numbers agree with those for the degree reverse lexicographical initial ideals of the ideal generated by a sufficiently large number of generic forms, and of the annihilator ideal of a generic form.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free Modules over Commutative Domains of Krull Dimension One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a domain of Krull dimension one, we study when the class $\mathcal{F}$ of modules over $R$ that are arbitrary direct sums of finitely generated torsion-free modules is closed under direct summands. If $R$ is local, we show that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under direct summands if and only if any indecomposable, finitely generated, torsion-free module has local endomorphism ring. If, in addition, $R$ is noetherian this is equivalent to say that the normalization of $R$ is a local ring. If $R$ is an $h$-local domain of Krull dimension $1$ and $\mathcal{F}_R$ is closed under direct summands, then the property is inherited by the localizations of $R$ at maximal ideals. Moreover, any localizations of $R$ at a maximal ideal, except maybe one, satisfies that any finitely generated ideal is $2$-generated. The converse is true when the domain $R$ is, in addition, integrally closed, or noetherian semilocal or noetherian with module-finite normalization. Finally, over a commutative domain of finite character and with no restriction on the Krull dimension, we show that the isomorphism classes of countable generated modules in $\mathcal{F}$ are determined by their genus.</description>

      <title>Exploring the unleaved tree of numerical semigroups up to a given genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$ and $n_{77}=47008818196495180$.</description>

      <title>Material Interpretation and Constructive Analysis of Maximal Ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents the concept of material interpretation as a method to transform classical proofs into constructive ones. Using the case study of maximal ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$, it demonstrates how a classical implication $A \to B$ can be rephrased as a constructive disjunction $\neg A \vee B$, with $\neg A$ representing a strong form of negation. The approach is based on on G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, the strong negation, and potentially Herbrand disjunctions. The classical proof that every maximal ideal in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ contains a prime number is revisited, highlighting its reliance on non-constructive principles such as the law of excluded middle. A constructive proof is then developed, replacing abstract constructs with explicit case distinctions and direct computations in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$. This proof clarifies the logical structure and reveals computational content. The article discusses broader applications, such as Zariski's Lemma, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, and the Universal Krull-Lindenbaum Lemma, with an emphasis on practical implementation using tools such as Python and proof assistants. The material interpretation offers a promising framework for bridging classical and constructive mathematics, enabling algorithmic implementations.</description>
