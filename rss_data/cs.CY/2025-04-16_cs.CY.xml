      <title>Will AI shape the way we speak? The emerging sociolinguistic influence of synthetic voices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Persona-dependent LLM Alignment for the Moral Machine Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) with agency in real-world applications raises critical questions about how these models will behave. In particular, how will their decisions align with humans when faced with moral dilemmas? This study examines the alignment between LLM-driven decisions and human judgment in various contexts of the moral machine experiment, including personas reflecting different sociodemographics. We find that the moral decisions of LLMs vary substantially by persona, showing greater shifts in moral decisions for critical tasks than humans. Our data also indicate an interesting partisan sorting phenomenon, where political persona predominates the direction and degree of LLM decisions. We discuss the ethical implications and risks associated with deploying these models in applications that involve moral decisions.</description>

      <title>The Lifetime of the Covid Memorial Wall: Modelling with Collections Demography, Social Media Data and Citizen Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Covid Memorial Wall in London, featuring over 240,000 hand-painted red hearts, faces significant conservation challenges due to the rapid fading of the paint. This study evaluates the transition to a better-quality paint and its implications for the wall's long-term preservation. The rapid fading of the initial materials required an unsustainable repainting rate, burdening volunteers. Lifetime simulations based on a collections demography framework suggest that repainting efforts must continue at a rate of some hundreds of hearts per week to maintain a stable percentage of hearts in good condition. This finding highlights the need for a sustainable management strategy that includes regular maintenance or further reduction of the fading rate.
  Methodologically, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using a collections demography approach, supported by citizen science and social media data, to inform heritage management decisions. An agent-based simulation is used to propagate the multiple uncertainties measured. The methodology provides a robust basis for modeling and decision-making, even in a case like this, where reliance on publicly available images and volunteer-collected data introduces variability. Future studies could improve data within a citizen science framework by inviting public submissions, using on-site calibration charts, and increasing volunteer involvement for longitudinal data collection. This research illustrates the flexibility of the collections demography framework, firstly by showing its applicability to an outdoor monument, which is very different from the published case studies, and secondly by demonstrating how it can work even with low-quality data.</description>

      <title>Evaluating DAO Sustainability and Longevity Through On-Chain Governance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) automate governance and resource allocation through smart contracts, aiming to shift decision-making to distributed token holders. However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges linked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical design constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research gaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness, decentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a custom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and analysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance patterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration, which may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable, data-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying potential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional approach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for researchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and effectiveness of DAO-based governance models.</description>

      <title>Exposure to Content Written by Large Language Models Can Reduce Stigma Around Opioid Use Disorder in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widespread stigma, both in the offline and online spaces, acts as a barrier to harm reduction efforts in the context of opioid use disorder (OUD). This stigma is prominently directed towards clinically approved medications for addiction treatment (MAT), people with the condition, and the condition itself. Given the potential of artificial intelligence based technologies in promoting health equity, and facilitating empathic conversations, this work examines whether large language models (LLMs) can help abate OUD-related stigma in online communities. To answer this, we conducted a series of pre-registered randomized controlled experiments, where participants read LLM-generated, human-written, or no responses to help seeking OUD-related content in online communities. The experiment was conducted under two setups, i.e., participants read the responses either once (N = 2,141), or repeatedly for 14 days (N = 107). We found that participants reported the least stigmatized attitudes toward MAT after consuming LLM-generated responses under both the setups. This study offers insights into strategies that can foster inclusive online discourse on OUD, e.g., based on our findings LLMs can be used as an education-based intervention to promote positive attitudes and increase people's propensity toward MAT.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and the Dual Paradoxes: Examining the Interplay of Efficiency, Resource Consumption, and Labor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence's (AI) rapid development and growth not only transformed industries but also fired up important debates about its impacts on employment, resource allocation, and the ethics involved in decision-making. It serves to understand how changes within an industry will be able to influence society with that change. Advancing AI technologies will create a dual paradox of efficiency, greater resource consumption, and displacement of traditional labor. In this context, we explore the impact of AI on energy consumption, human labor roles, and hybrid roles widespread human labor replacement. We used mixed methods involving qualitative and quantitative analyses of data identified from various sources. Findings suggest that AI increases energy consumption and has impacted human labor roles to a minimal extent, considering that its applicability is limited to some tasks that require human judgment. In this context, the</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques for interpretation of food datasets: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become essential for analyzing complex data and solving highly-challenging tasks. It is being applied across numerous disciplines beyond computer science, including Food Engineering, where there is a growing demand for accurate and trustworthy predictions to meet stringent food quality standards. However, this requires increasingly complex AI models, raising reliability concerns. In response, eXplainable AI (XAI) has emerged to provide insights into AI decision-making, aiding model interpretation by developers and users. Nevertheless, XAI remains underutilized in Food Engineering, limiting model reliability. For instance, in food quality control, AI models using spectral imaging can detect contaminants or assess freshness levels, but their opaque decision-making process hinders adoption. XAI techniques such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) can pinpoint which spectral wavelengths or image regions contribute most to a prediction, enhancing transparency and aiding quality control inspectors in verifying AI-generated assessments. This survey presents a taxonomy for classifying food quality research using XAI techniques, organized by data types and explanation methods, to guide researchers in choosing suitable approaches. We also highlight trends, challenges, and opportunities to encourage the adoption of XAI in Food Engineering.</description>

      <title>LOKA Protocol: A Decentralized Framework for Trustworthy and Ethical AI Agent Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of autonomous AI agents, capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting independently, signals a profound shift in how digital ecosystems operate, govern, and evolve. As these agents proliferate beyond centralized infrastructures, they expose foundational gaps in identity, accountability, and ethical alignment. Three critical questions emerge: Identity: Who or what is the agent? Accountability: Can its actions be verified, audited, and trusted? Ethical Consensus: Can autonomous systems reliably align with human values and prevent harmful emergent behaviors? We present the novel LOKA Protocol (Layered Orchestration for Knowledgeful Agents), a unified, systems-level architecture for building ethically governed, interoperable AI agent ecosystems. LOKA introduces a proposed Universal Agent Identity Layer (UAIL) for decentralized, verifiable identity; intent-centric communication protocols for semantic coordination across diverse agents; and a Decentralized Ethical Consensus Protocol (DECP) that enables agents to make context-aware decisions grounded in shared ethical baselines. Anchored in emerging standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and post-quantum cryptography, LOKA offers a scalable, future-resilient blueprint for multi-agent AI governance. By embedding identity, trust, and ethics into the protocol layer itself, LOKA establishes the foundation for a new era of responsible, transparent, and autonomous AI ecosystems operating across digital and physical domains.</description>

      <title>Heating reduction as collective action: Impact on attitudes, behavior and energy consumption in a Polish field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heating and hot water usage account for nearly 80% of household energy consumption in the European Union. In order to reach the EU New Deal goals, new policies to reduce heat energy consumption are indispensable. However, research targeting reductions concentrates either on technical building interventions without considerations of people's behavior, or psychological interventions with no technical interference. Such interventions can be promising, but their true potential for scaling up can only be realized by testing approaches that integrate behavioral and technical solutions in tandem rather than in isolation. In this research, we study a mix of psychological and technical interventions targeting heating and hot water demand among students in Polish university dormitories. We evaluate effects on building energy consumption, behavioral spillovers and on social beliefs and attitudes in a pre-post quasi-experimental mixed-method field study in three student dormitories. Our findings reveal that the most effective approaches to yield energy savings were a direct, collectively framed request to students to reduce thermostat settings for the environment, and an automated technical adjustment of the heating curve temperature. Conversely, interventions targeting domestic hot water had unintended effects, including increased energy use and negative spillovers, such as higher water consumption. Further, we find that informing students about their active, collective participation had a positive impact on perceived social norms. Our findings highlight the importance of trialing interventions in controlled real-world settings to understand the interplay between technical systems, behaviors, and social impacts to enable scalable, evidence-based policies driving an effective and sustainable energy transition.</description>

      <title>Using LLMs as prompt modifier to avoid biases in AI image generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce biases in text-to-image generation systems by modifying user prompts. We define bias as a model's unfair deviation from population statistics given neutral prompts. Our experiments with Stable Diffusion XL, 3.5 and Flux demonstrate that LLM-modified prompts significantly increase image diversity and reduce bias without the need to change the image generators themselves. While occasionally producing results that diverge from original user intent for elaborate prompts, this approach generally provides more varied interpretations of underspecified requests rather than superficial variations. The method works particularly well for less advanced image generators, though limitations persist for certain contexts like disability representation. All prompts and generated images are available at https://iisys-hof.github.io/llm-prompt-img-gen/</description>

      <title>Exploring Student Behaviors and Motivations using AI TAs with Optional Guardrails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-powered chatbots and digital teaching assistants (AI TAs) are gaining popularity in programming education, offering students timely and personalized feedback. Despite their potential benefits, concerns about student over-reliance and academic misconduct have prompted the introduction of "guardrails" into AI TAs - features that provide scaffolded support rather than direct solutions. However, overly restrictive guardrails may lead students to bypass these tools and use unconstrained AI models, where interactions are not observable, thus limiting our understanding of students' help-seeking behaviors. To investigate this, we designed and deployed a novel AI TA tool with optional guardrails in one lab of a large introductory programming course. As students completed three code writing and debugging tasks, they had the option to receive guardrailed help or use a "See Solution" feature which disabled the guardrails and generated a verbatim response from the underlying model. We investigate students' motivations and use of this feature and examine the association between usage and their course performance. We found that 50% of the 885 students used the "See Solution" feature for at least one problem and 14% used it for all three problems. Additionally, low-performing students were more likely to use this feature and use it close to the deadline as they started assignments later. The predominant factors that motivated students to disable the guardrails were assistance in solving problems, time pressure, lack of self-regulation, and curiosity. Our work provides insights into students' solution-seeking motivations and behaviors, which has implications for the design of AI TAs that balance pedagogical goals with student preferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Large Language Models (OLLMs) are increasingly leveraged in generative AI applications, posing new challenges for detecting their outputs. We propose OpenTuringBench, a new benchmark based on OLLMs, designed to train and evaluate machine-generated text detectors on the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution problems. OpenTuringBench focuses on a representative set of OLLMs, and features a number of challenging evaluation tasks, including human/machine-manipulated texts, out-of-domain texts, and texts from previously unseen models. We also provide OTBDetector, a contrastive learning framework to detect and attribute OLLM-based machine-generated texts. Results highlight the relevance and varying degrees of difficulty of the OpenTuringBench tasks, with our detector achieving remarkable capabilities across the various tasks and outperforming most existing detectors. Resources are available on the OpenTuringBench Hugging Face repository at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MLNTeam-Unical/OpenTuringBench</description>

      <title>Cancer-Myth: Evaluating AI Chatbot on Patient Questions with False Presuppositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) as a new form of internet search for medical information, making it critical to assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patient questions with detailed clinical contexts. In this paper, we first evaluate LLMs on cancer-related questions drawn from real patients, reviewed by three hematology oncology physicians. While responses are generally accurate, with GPT-4-Turbo scoring 4.13 out of 5, the models frequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions-posing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation systematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-4o, Gemini-1.Pro, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than 30% of the time. Even advanced medical agentic methods do not prevent LLMs from ignoring false presuppositions. These findings expose a critical gap in the clinical reliability of LLMs and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in medical AI systems.</description>

      <title>Masculine Defaults via Gendered Discourse in Podcasts and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masculine defaults are widely recognized as a significant type of gender bias, but they are often unseen as they are under-researched. Masculine defaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine characteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance of, those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work, we study discourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the large-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken content via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the measurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words in LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus our study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing 15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse words -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered discourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse words in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based masculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and video games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse words from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that the masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than the feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on downstream tasks for men. Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns with better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models -- and this embedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculine default.</description>

      <title>Towards the Terminator Economy: Assessing Job Exposure to AI through LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI and related technologies are reshaping jobs and tasks, either by automating or augmenting human skills in the workplace. Many researchers have been working on estimating if and to what extent jobs and tasks are exposed to the risk of being automatized by AI-related technologies. Our work tackles this issue through a data-driven approach by: (i) developing a reproducible framework that uses cutting-edge open-source large language models to assess the current capabilities of AI and robotics in performing job-related tasks; (ii) formalizing and computing a measure of AI exposure by occupation, the Task Exposure to AI (TEAI) index, and a measure of Task Replacement by AI (TRAI), both validated through a human user evaluation and compared with the state of the art.
  Our results show that the TEAI index is positively correlated with cognitive, problem-solving and management skills, while it is negatively correlated with social skills. Applying the index to the US, we obtain that about one-third of US employment is highly exposed to AI, primarily in high-skill jobs requiring a graduate or postgraduate level of education. We also find that AI exposure is positively associated with both employment and wage growth in 2003-2023, suggesting that AI has an overall positive effect on productivity.
  Considering specifically the TRAI index, we find that even in high-skill occupations, AI exhibits high variability in task substitution, suggesting that AI and humans complement each other within the same occupation, while the allocation of tasks within occupations is likely to change.
  All results, models, and code are freely available online to allow the community to reproduce our results, compare outcomes, and use our work as a benchmark to monitor AI's progress over time.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Behaviors Across Regions: A Geolocation Audit of YouTube Search for COVID-19 Misinformation Between the United States and South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being an integral tool for finding health-related information online, YouTube has faced criticism for disseminating COVID-19 misinformation globally to its users. Yet, prior audit studies have predominantly investigated YouTube within the Global North contexts, often overlooking the Global South. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive 10-day geolocation-based audit on YouTube to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation in search results between the United States (US) and South Africa (SA), the countries heavily affected by the pandemic in the Global North and the Global South, respectively. For each country, we selected 3 geolocations and placed sock-puppets, or bots emulating "real" users, that collected search results for 48 search queries sorted by 4 search filters for 10 days, yielding a dataset of 915K results. We found that 31.55% of the top-10 search results contained COVID-19 misinformation. Among the top-10 search results, bots in SA faced significantly more misinformative search results than their US counterparts. Overall, our study highlights the contrasting algorithmic behaviors of YouTube search between two countries, underscoring the need for the platform to regulate algorithmic behavior consistently across different regions of the Globe.</description>

      <title>Short note on the mapping of heritage sites impacted by the 2024 floods in Valencia, Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short note presents preliminary findings on the impact of the October 2024 floods on cultural heritage sites in Valencia, Spain. Using publicly available data, we assess the extent of potential damage by overlaying flood maps with heritage site coordinates. We identify that 3.3% of heritage sites in the region have been potentially impacted, with churches and shrines (81), outdoor religious iconography (78), and historic irrigation features (45) being the most heavily affected. Our analysis utilizes data from OpenStreetMap and listings from the Generalitat Valenciana, suggesting that while OpenStreetMap's crowd-sourced data can provide useful estimates of the proportion of impacted sites, it may not be suitable for a detailed damage assessment. By sharing this data openly, we aim to contribute to international efforts in preserving cultural heritage after the disaster and provide a foundation for future assessments of heritage site vulnerability to climate-related events.</description>

      <title>Superintelligence Strategy: Expert Version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advances in AI are beginning to reshape national security. Destabilizing AI developments could rupture the balance of power and raise the odds of great-power conflict, while widespread proliferation of capable AI hackers and virologists would lower barriers for rogue actors to cause catastrophe. Superintelligence -- AI vastly better than humans at nearly all cognitive tasks -- is now anticipated by AI researchers. Just as nations once developed nuclear strategies to secure their survival, we now need a coherent superintelligence strategy to navigate a new period of transformative change. We introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction (MAD) where any state's aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals. Given the relative ease of sabotaging a destabilizing AI project -- through interventions ranging from covert cyberattacks to potential kinetic strikes on datacenters -- MAIM already describes the strategic picture AI superpowers find themselves in. Alongside this, states can increase their competitiveness by bolstering their economies and militaries through AI, and they can engage in nonproliferation to rogue actors to keep weaponizable AI capabilities out of their hands. Taken together, the three-part framework of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness outlines a robust strategy to superintelligence in the years ahead.</description>

      <title>Bridging Technology and Humanities: Evaluating the Impact of Large Language Models on Social Sciences Research with DeepSeek-R1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing and has gradually been applied to the field of humanities and social sciences research. LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences.
  This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education . Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading.
  Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields. LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>AI threats to national security can be countered through an incident regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19887v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a timely proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe sectors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Become Policy Refinement Partners? Evidence from China's Social Security Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping operational paradigms across multidisciplinary domains. LLMs' emergent capability to synthesize policy-relevant insights across disciplinary boundaries suggests potential as decision-support tools. However, their actual performance and suitability as policy refinement partners still require verification through rigorous and systematic evaluations. Our study employs the context-embedded generation-adaptation framework to conduct a tripartite comparison among the American GPT-4o, the Chinese DeepSeek-R1 and human researchers, investigating the capability boundaries and performance characteristics of LLMs in generating policy recommendations for China's social security issues. This study demonstrates that while LLMs exhibit distinct advantages in systematic policy design, they face significant limitations in addressing complex social dynamics, balancing stakeholder interests, and controlling fiscal risks within the social security domain. Furthermore, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance to GPT-4o across all evaluation dimensions in policy recommendation generation, illustrating the potential of localized training to improve contextual alignment. These findings suggest that regionally-adapted LLMs can function as supplementary tools for generating diverse policy alternatives informed by domain-specific social insights. Nevertheless, the formulation of policy refinement requires integration with human researchers' expertise, which remains critical for interpreting institutional frameworks, cultural norms, and value systems.</description>

      <title>"A Good Bot Always Knows Its Limitations": Assessing Autonomous System Decision-making Competencies through Factorized Machine Self-confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can intelligent machines assess their competency to complete a task? This question has come into focus for autonomous systems that algorithmically make decisions under uncertainty. We argue that machine self-confidence -- a form of meta-reasoning based on self-assessments of system knowledge about the state of the world, itself, and ability to reason about and execute tasks -- leads to many computable and useful competency indicators for such agents. This paper presents our body of work, so far, on this concept in the form of the Factorized Machine Self-confidence (FaMSeC) framework, which holistically considers several major factors driving competency in algorithmic decision-making: outcome assessment, solver quality, model quality, alignment quality, and past experience. In FaMSeC, self-confidence indicators are derived via 'problem-solving statistics' embedded in Markov decision process solvers and related approaches. These statistics come from evaluating probabilistic exceedance margins in relation to certain outcomes and associated competency standards specified by an evaluator. Once designed, and evaluated, the statistics can be easily incorporated into autonomous agents and serve as indicators of competency. We include detailed descriptions and examples for Markov decision process agents, and show how outcome assessment and solver quality factors can be found for a range of tasking contexts through novel use of meta-utility functions, behavior simulations, and surrogate prediction models. Numerical evaluations are performed to demonstrate that FaMSeC indicators perform as desired (references to human subject studies beyond the scope of this paper are provided).</description>

      <title>Reddit Rules and Rulers: Quantifying the Link Between Rules and Perceptions of Governance across Thousands of Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rules are a critical component of the functioning of nearly every online community, yet it is challenging for community moderators to make data-driven decisions about what rules to set for their communities. The connection between a community's rules and how its membership feels about its governance is not well understood. In this work, we conduct the largest-to-date analysis of rules on Reddit, collecting a set of 67,545 unique rules across 5,225 communities which collectively account for more than 67% of all content on Reddit. More than just a point-in-time study, our work measures how communities change their rules over a 5+ year period. We develop a method to classify these rules using a taxonomy of 17 key attributes extended from previous work. We assess what types of rules are most prevalent, how rules are phrased, and how they vary across communities of different types. Using a dataset of communities' discussions about their governance, we are the first to identify the rules most strongly associated with positive community perceptions of governance: rules addressing who participates, how content is formatted and tagged, and rules about commercial activities. We conduct a longitudinal study to quantify the impact of adding new rules to communities, finding that after a rule is added, community perceptions of governance immediately improve, yet this effect diminishes after six months. Our results have important implications for platforms, moderators, and researchers. We make our classification model and rules datasets public to support future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>AI Enabled User-Specific Cyberbullying Severity Detection with Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of social media has significantly increased the prevalence of cyberbullying (CB), posing serious risks to both mental and physical well-being. Effective detection systems are essential for mitigating its impact. While several machine learning (ML) models have been developed, few incorporate victims' psychological, demographic, and behavioral factors alongside bullying comments to assess severity. In this study, we propose an AI model intregrating user-specific attributes, including psychological factors (self-esteem, anxiety, depression), online behavior (internet usage, disciplinary history), and demographic attributes (race, gender, ethnicity), along with social media comments. Additionally, we introduce a re-labeling technique that categorizes social media comments into three severity levels: Not Bullying, Mild Bullying, and Severe Bullying, considering user-specific factors.Our LSTM model is trained using 146 features, incorporating emotional, topical, and word2vec representations of social media comments as well as user-level attributes and it outperforms existing baseline models, achieving the highest accuracy of 98\% and an F1-score of 0.97. To identify key factors influencing the severity of cyberbullying, we employ explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) to interpret the model's decision-making process. Our findings reveal that, beyond hate comments, victims belonging to specific racial and gender groups are more frequently targeted and exhibit higher incidences of depression, disciplinary issues, and low self-esteem. Additionally, individuals with a prior history of bullying are at a greater risk of becoming victims of cyberbullying.</description>

      <title>Niche Dynamics in Complex Online Community Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online communities are important organizational forms where members socialize and share information. Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Clinical Decision Support through Multi-Agent Systems and Ethical AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the data-driven medicine approach, which integrates ethically managed and explainable artificial intelligence into clinical decision support systems (CDSS), are critical to ensure reliable and effective patient care. This paper focuses on comparing novel agent system designs that use modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical context, and to predict and validate results. We implement our agent system with the eICU database, including running lab analysis, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners agents first, then sharing the memory into the integration agent, prediction agent, transparency agent, and a validation agent. Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS) performed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction accuracy (59%, 56%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82 days), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is slightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5). Finally, this study suggests that our agent-based framework not only improves process transparency and prediction accuracy but also strengthens trustworthy AI-assisted decision support in an intensive care setting.</description>

      <title>Frontier AI's Impact on the Cybersecurity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As frontier AI advances rapidly, understanding its impact on cybersecurity and inherent risks is essential to ensuring safe AI evolution (e.g., guiding risk mitigation and informing policymakers). While some studies review AI applications in cybersecurity, none of them comprehensively discuss AI's future impacts or provide concrete recommendations for navigating its safe and secure usage. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of frontier AI's impact on cybersecurity and establishes a systematic framework for risk assessment and mitigation. To this end, we first define and categorize the marginal risks of frontier AI in cybersecurity and then systemically analyze the current and future impacts of frontier AI in cybersecurity, qualitatively and quantitatively. We also discuss why frontier AI likely benefits attackers more than defenders in the short term from equivalence classes, asymmetry, and economic impact. Next, we explore frontier AI's impact on future software system development, including enabling complex hybrid systems while introducing new risks. Based on our findings, we provide security recommendations, including constructing fine-grained benchmarks for risk assessment, designing AI agents for defenses, building security mechanisms and provable defenses for hybrid systems, enhancing pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and strengthening defenses for users. Finally, we present long-term research questions essential for understanding AI's future impacts and unleashing its defensive capabilities.</description>
