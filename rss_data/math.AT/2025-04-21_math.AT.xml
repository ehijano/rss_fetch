      <title>Use of Topological Data Analysis for the Detection of Phenomenological Bifurcations in Stochastic Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate predictions of stochastic compartmental models on the severity of disease outbreaks. The models we consider are the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) for bacterial infections, and the Susceptible -Infected-Removed (SIR) for airborne diseases. Stochasticity enters the compartmental models as random fluctuations of the contact rate, to account for uncertainties in the disease spread. We consider three types of noise to model the random fluctuations: the Gaussian white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noises, and the logarithmic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (logOU). The advantages of logOU noise are its positivity and its ability to model the presence of superspreaders. We utilize homological bifurcation plots from Topological Data Analysis to automatically determine the shape of the long-time distributions of the number of infected for the SIS, and removed for the SIR model, over a range of basic reproduction numbers and relative noise intensities. LogOU noise results in distributions that stay close to the endemic deterministic equilibrium even for high noise intensities. For low reproduction rates and increasing intensity, the distribution peak shifts towards zero, that is, disease eradication, for all three noises; for logOU noise the shift is the slowest. Our study underlines the sensitivity of model predictions to the type of noise considered in contact rate.</description>

      <title>Quillen cohomology of enriched operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.01198v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A modern insight due to Quillen, which is further developed by Lurie, asserts that many cohomology theories of interest are particular cases of a single construction, which allows one to define cohomology groups in an abstract setting using only intrinsic properties of the category (or $\infty$-category) at hand. This universal cohomology theory is known as Quillen cohomology. In any setting, Quillen cohomology of a given object is classified by its cotangent complex. The main purpose of this paper is to study Quillen cohomology of operads enriched over a general base category. Our main result provides an explicit formula for computing Quillen cohomology of enriched operads, based on a procedure of taking certain infinitesimal models of their cotangent complexes. Furthermore, we propose a natural construction of the twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of simplicial operads. We then assert that the cotangent complex of a simplicial operad can be represented as a spectrum valued functor on its twisted arrow $\infty$-category.
  When working in stable base categories such as chain complexes and spectra, Francis and Lurie proved the existence of a fiber sequence relating the cotangent complex and Hochschild complex of an $E_n$-algebra, from which a conjecture of Kontsevich is verified. We establish an analogous fiber sequence for the operad $E_n$ itself, in the topological setting.</description>

      <title>Hochschild and cotangent complexes of operadic algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of the cotangent complex formalism developed by Lurie to formulate Quillen cohomology of algebras over an enriched operad. Additionally, we introduce a spectral Hochschild cohomology theory for enriched operads and algebras over them. We prove that both the Quillen and Hochschild cohomologies of algebras over an operad can be controlled by the corresponding cohomologies of the operad itself. When passing to the category of simplicial sets, we assert that both these cohomology theories for operads, as well as their associated algebras, can be calculated in the same framework of spectrum valued functors on the twisted arrow $\infty$-category of the operad of interest. Moreover, we provide a convenient cofiber sequence relating the Hochschild and cotangent complexes of an $E_n$-space, establishing an unstable analogue of a significant result obtained by Francis and Lurie. Our strategy introduces a novel perspective, focusing solely on the intrinsic properties of the operadic twisted arrow $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the apparent incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces and we give some suggestions for future works.</description>

      <title>Homology reveals significant anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test the tenet of statistical isotropy of the standard cosmological model via a homology analysis of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps. Examining small sectors of the normalized maps, we find that the results exhibit a dependence on whether we compute the mean and variance locally from the masked patch, or from the full masked sky. Assigning local mean and variance for normalization, we find the maximum discrepancy between the data and model in the galactic northern hemisphere at more than $3.5$ s.d. for the PR4 dataset at degree-scale. For the PR3 dataset, the C-R and SMICA maps exhibit higher significance than the PR4 dataset at $\sim 4$ and $4.1$ s.d. respectively, however the NILC and SEVEM maps exhibit lower significance at $\sim 3.4$ s.d. The southern hemisphere exhibits high degree of consistency between the data and the model for both the PR4 and PR3 datasets. Assigning the mean and variance of the full masked sky decreases the significance for the northern hemisphere, the tails in particular. However the tails in the southern hemisphere are strongly discrepant at more than $4$ standard deviations at approximately $5$ degrees. The $p$-values obtained from the $\chi^2$-statistic exhibit commensurate significance in both the experiments. Examining the quadrants of the sphere, we find the first quadrant to be the major source of the discrepancy. Prima-facie, the results indicate a breakdown of statistical isotropy in the CMB maps, however more work is needed to ascertain the source of the anomaly. Regardless, these map characteristics may have serious consequences for downstream computations such as parameter estimation, and the related Hubble tension.</description>
