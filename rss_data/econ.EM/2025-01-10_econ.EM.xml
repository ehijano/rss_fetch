      <title>Identification of dynamic treatment effects when treatment histories are partially observed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a class of methods for identifying and estimating dynamic treatment effects when outcomes depend on the entire treatment path and treatment histories are only partially observed. We advocate for the approach which we refer to as `robust' that identifies path-dependent treatment effects for different mover subpopulations under misspecification of any one of three models involved (outcome, propensity score, or missing data models). Our approach can handle fixed, absorbing, sequential, or simultaneous treatment regimes where missing treatment histories may obfuscate identification of causal effects. Numerical experiments demonstrate how the proposed estimator compares to traditional complete-case methods. We find that the missingness-adjusted estimates have negligible bias compared to their complete-case counterparts. As an illustration, we apply the proposed class of adjustment methods to estimate dynamic effects of COVID-19 on voter turnout in the 2022 U.S. general elections. We find that counties that experienced above-average number of cases in 2020 and 2021 had a statistically significant reduction in voter turnout compared to those that did not.</description>

      <title>DisSim-FinBERT: Text Simplification for Core Message Extraction in Complex Financial Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research integrates Discourse Simplification (DisSim) into aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to improve aspect selection and sentiment prediction in complex financial texts, particularly central bank communications. The study focuses on decomposing Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes into simple, canonical structures to identify key sentences encapsulating the core messages of intricate financial narratives. The investigation examines whether hierarchical segmenting of financial texts can enhance ABSA performance using a pre-trained Financial BERT model. Results indicate that DisSim methods enhance aspect selection accuracy in simplified texts compared to untreated counterparts and show empirical improvement in sentiment prediction. The study concludes that decomposing complex financial texts into shorter segments with Discourse Simplification can lead to more precise aspect selection, thereby facilitating more accurate economic analyses.</description>

      <title>RUM-NN: A Neural Network Model Compatible with Random Utility Maximisation for Discrete Choice Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for capturing stochasticity of choice probabilities in neural networks, derived from and fully consistent with the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) theory, referred to as RUM-NN. Neural network models show remarkable performance compared with statistical models; however, they are often criticized for their lack of transparency and interoperability. The proposed RUM-NN is introduced in both linear and nonlinear structures. The linear RUM-NN retains the interpretability and identifiability of traditional econometric discrete choice models while using neural network-based estimation techniques. The nonlinear RUM-NN extends the model's flexibility and predictive capabilities to capture nonlinear relationships between variables within utility functions. Additionally, the RUM-NN allows for the implementation of various parametric distributions for unobserved error components in the utility function and captures correlations among error terms. The performance of RUM-NN in parameter recovery and prediction accuracy is rigorously evaluated using synthetic datasets through Monte Carlo experiments. Additionally, RUM-NN is evaluated on the Swissmetro and the London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC) datasets with different sets of distribution assumptions for the error component. The results demonstrate that RUM-NN under a linear utility structure and IID Gumbel error terms can replicate the performance of the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, but relaxing those constraints leads to superior performance for both Swissmetro and LPMC datasets. By introducing a novel estimation approach aligned with statistical theories, this study empowers econometricians to harness the advantages of neural network models.</description>

      <title>Comparing latent inequality with ordinal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new ways to compare two latent distributions when only ordinal data are available and without imposing parametric assumptions on the underlying continuous distributions. First, we contribute identification results. We show how certain ordinal conditions provide evidence of between-group inequality, quantified by particular quantiles being higher in one latent distribution than in the other. We also show how other ordinal conditions provide evidence of higher within-group inequality in one distribution than in the other, quantified by particular interquantile ranges being wider in one latent distribution than in the other. Second, we propose an "inner" confidence set for the quantiles that are higher for the first latent distribution. We also describe frequentist and Bayesian inference on features of the ordinal distributions relevant to our identification results. Our contributions are illustrated by empirical examples with mental health and general health.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Bidirectional Causal Relationships Between Transaction Fees and Economic Activity of Subsystems Utilizing the Ethereum Blockchain Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ethereum blockchain network enables transaction processing and smart-contract execution through levies of transaction fees, commonly known as gas fees. This framework mediates economic participation via a market-based mechanism for gas fees, permitting users to offer higher gas fees to expedite pro-cessing. Historically, the ensuing gas fee volatility led to critical disequilibria between supply and demand for block space, presenting stakeholder challenges. This study examines the dynamic causal interplay between transaction fees and economic subsystems leveraging the network. By utilizing data related to unique active wallets and transaction volume of each subsystem and applying time-varying Granger causality analysis, we reveal temporal heterogeneity in causal relationships between economic activity and transaction fees across all subsystems. This includes (a) a bidirectional causal feedback loop between cross-blockchain bridge user activity and transaction fees, which diminishes over time, potentially signaling user migration; (b) a bidirectional relationship between centralized cryptocurrency exchange deposit and withdrawal transaction volume and fees, indicative of increased competition for block space; (c) decentralized exchange volumes causally influence fees, while fees causally influence user activity, although this relationship is weakening, potentially due to the diminished significance of decentralized finance; (d) intermittent causal relationships with maximal extractable value bots; (e) fees causally in-fluence non-fungible token transaction volumes; and (f) a highly significant and growing causal influence of transaction fees on stablecoin activity and transaction volumes highlight its prominence.</description>

      <title>Linear Multidimensional Regression with Interactive Fixed-Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11691v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a linear and additively separable regression model for multidimensional panel data of three or more dimensions with unobserved interactive fixed effects. The main estimator follows a double debias approach, and requires two preliminary steps to control unobserved heterogeneity. First, the model is embedded within the standard two-dimensional panel framework and restrictions are formed under which the factor structure methods in Bai (2009) lead to consistent estimation of model parameters, but at slow rates of convergence. The second step develops a weighted fixed-effects method that is robust to the multidimensional nature of the problem and achieves the parametric rate of consistency. This second step is combined with a double debias procedure for asymptotically normal slope estimates. The methods are implemented to estimate the demand elasticity for beer.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Uniform Confidence Bands for Group-Time Conditional Average Treatment Effects in Difference-in-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a panel data analysis to examine the heterogeneity in treatment effects with respect to a pre-treatment covariate of interest in the staggered difference-in-differences setting of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). Under standard identification conditions, a doubly robust estimand conditional on the covariate identifies the group-time conditional average treatment effect given the covariate. Focusing on the case of a continuous covariate, we propose a three-step estimation procedure based on nonparametric local polynomial regressions and parametric estimation methods. Using uniformly valid distributional approximation results for empirical processes and multiplier bootstrapping, we develop doubly robust inference methods to construct uniform confidence bands for the group-time conditional average treatment effect function and a variety of useful summary parameters. The accompanying R package didhetero allows for easy implementation of our methods.</description>

      <title>Causal Machine Learning for Moderation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is valuable for any decision maker to know the impact of decisions (treatments) on average and for subgroups. The causal machine learning literature has recently provided tools for estimating group average treatment effects (GATE) to better describe treatment heterogeneity. This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting such differences in treatment effects between groups while accounting for variations in other covariates. We propose a new parameter, the balanced group average treatment effect (BGATE), which measures a GATE with a specific distribution of a priori-determined covariates. By taking the difference between two BGATEs, we can analyze heterogeneity more meaningfully than by comparing two GATEs, as we can separate the difference due to the different distributions of other variables and the difference due to the variable of interest. The main estimation strategy for this parameter is based on double/debiased machine learning for discrete treatments in an unconfoundedness setting, and the estimator is shown to be $\sqrt{N}$-consistent and asymptotically normal under standard conditions. We propose two additional estimation strategies: automatic debiased machine learning and a specific reweighting procedure. Last, we demonstrate the usefulness of these parameters in a small-scale simulation study and in an empirical example.</description>

      <title>Randomly Assigned First Differences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03208v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider treatment-effect estimation with a two-periods panel, using a first-difference regression of the outcome evolution $\Delta Y_g$ on the treatment evolution $\Delta D_g$. To justify this regression, one may assume that $\Delta D_g$ is as good as randomly assigned, namely uncorrelated to the residual of the first-differenced model and to the treatment's effect. This paper shows that if one posits a causal model in levels between the treatment and the outcome, then the residual of the first-differenced model is a function of the period-one treatment $D_{g,1}$, so the first-difference regression may suffer from an omitted variable bias whenever $\Delta D_g$ is correlated to $D_{g,1}$. To solve this problem, one can control for $E(\Delta D_g|D_{g,1})$ in the regression. I apply these results to a first-difference regression of the 1999 to 2007 employment evolutions of US industries on the evolution of their Chinese imports penetration ratio, estimated on the data of Acemoglu et al. (2016). $\Delta D_g$ and $D_{g,1}$ are very strongly correlated, so this regression may suffer from an omitted variable bias. Controlling for $E(\Delta D_g|D_{g,1})$ reduces the estimated effect of Chinese imports penetration by 42 to 51%, and makes it less significant.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Country-Level Vaccination Rates and Determinants of Practical Capacity to Administer COVID-19 Vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 vaccine development, manufacturing, transportation, and administration proved an extreme logistics operation of global magnitude. Global vaccination levels, however, remain a key concern in preventing the emergence of new strains and minimizing the impact of the pandemic's disruption of daily life. In this paper, country-level vaccination rates are analyzed through a queuing framework to extract service rates that represent the practical capacity of a country to administer vaccines. These rates are further characterized through regression and interpretable machine learning methods with country-level demographic, governmental, and socio-economic variates. Model results show that participation in multi-governmental collaborations such as COVAX may improve the ability to vaccinate. Similarly, improved transportation and accessibility variates such as roads per area for low-income countries and rail lines per area for high-income countries can improve rates. It was also found that for low-income countries specifically, improvements in basic and health infrastructure (as measured through spending on healthcare, number of doctors and hospital beds per 100k, population percent with access to electricity, life expectancy, and vehicles per 1000 people) resulted in higher vaccination rates. Of the high-income countries, those with larger 65-plus populations struggled to vaccinate at high rates, indicating potential accessibility issues for the elderly. This study finds that improving basic and health infrastructure, focusing on accessibility in the last mile, particularly for the elderly, and fostering global partnerships can improve logistical operations of such a scale. Such structural impediments and inequities in global health care must be addressed in preparation for future global public health crises.</description>
