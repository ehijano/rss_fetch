      <title>Causality for VARMA processes with instantaneous effects: The global Markov property, faithfulness and instrumental variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal reasoning has gained great attention over the last half century as it allows (or at least intends) to answer questions which go above those within the capabilities of classical inferential statistics using just observational data. So far, causal research has been focused mostly on the i.i.d. setting. However, many are the situations where there exists a non-trivial dependence structure between sequential observations. Motivated by this fact, the main purpose of this work is to study causal properties of time series under the structural assumption of a VARMA model with instantaneous effects. First, the global Markov property is studied, building on existing work for VAR processes without instantaneous effects. Infinite graphs which represent the dependencies of the process are defined so that separation statements translate to conditional independencies in the stationary distribution of the process. Second, faithfulness is examined as a counterpart of this Markov property. Conditions are given so that the stationary distribution of the process is almost surely faithful to said infinite graphs. In addition, an instrumental variable regression framework is developed for VARMA models with instantaneous effects. This allows to identify and consistently estimate total causal effects.</description>

      <title>Hardware-in-the-Loop Evaluation of Goodness of Fit (GoF) Testing for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to parametric spectrum sensing, non-parametric spectrum sensing can effectively detect the primary user's presence or absence without prior information about the primary user. Particularly, non-parametric spectrum sensing can be useful in dynamic spectrum sharing. The secondary user must detect incumbents and peer secondary users in dynamic spectrum sharing. The secondary user can use the licensed spectrum if the primary user is not detected using its band. The primary user detection problem is the goodness-of-fit testing problem. In this work, we performed a hardware-in-the-loop evaluation of goodness-of-fit tests such as Cramer-von-Mises (CM), Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests. We used a wideband radio transceiver RFSoC 4x2 from AMD and an F8 radio channel emulator to perform GoF tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular learning models with non-positive Fisher information matrices include neural networks, reduced-rank regression, Boltzmann machines, normal mixture models, and others. These models have been widely used in the development of learning machines. However, theoretical analysis is still in its early stages.
  In this paper, we examine learning coefficients, which indicate the general learning efficiency of deep linear learning models and three-layer neural network models with ReLU units. Finally, we extend the results to include the case of the Softmax function.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Recovery of Unambiguous Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</description>

      <title>Covariance constraints for stochastic inverse problems of computer models</title>

      <description>arXiv:1806.03440v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic inverse problems considered in this article consist of estimating the probability distributions of intrinsically random inputs of computer models. These estimations are based on observable outputs affected by model noise, and such problems are increasingly examined in parametric Bayesian contexts where the parameters of the targeted input distributions are affected by epistemic uncertainties. With the aim of improving the meaningfulness of solutions found by statistical algorithms -- in the sense that forward simulations based on such solutions must lead to relevant observables -- we derive new prior constraints using the principles of global sensitivity analysis and information theory. Primarily formalized as constraints on covariances in Gaussian linear or linearizable situations, they reflect the idea that the solution should explain most of the observable uncertainty, while the model noise remains a secondary factor of this uncertainty. Simulated experiments highlight that, when injected into stochastic inversion algorithms, these constraints can indeed limit the influence of model noise on the result. They provide hope for future extensions in more general frameworks, for example through the use of linear Gaussian mixtures.</description>

      <title>Sparse factor models of high dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the estimation of a sparse factor model where the factor loading matrix is assumed sparse. The estimation problem is reformulated as a penalized M-estimation criterion, while the restrictions for identifying the factor loading matrix accommodate a wide range of sparsity patterns. We prove the sparsistency property of the penalized estimator when the number of parameters is diverging, that is the consistency of the estimator and the recovery of the true zeros entries. These theoretical results are illustrated by finite-sample simulation experiments, and the relevance of the proposed method is assessed by applications to portfolio allocation and macroeconomic data prediction.</description>

      <title>Sparsity meets correlation in Gaussian sequence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study estimation of an $s$-sparse signal in the $p$-dimensional Gaussian sequence model with equicorrelated observations and derive the minimax rate. A new phenomenon emerges from correlation, namely the rate scales with respect to $p-2s$ and exhibits a phase transition at $p-2s \asymp \sqrt{p}$. Correlation is shown to be a blessing provided it is sufficiently strong, and the critical correlation level exhibits a delicate dependence on the sparsity level. Due to correlation, the minimax rate is driven by two subproblems: estimation of a linear functional (the average of the signal) and estimation of the signal's $(p-1)$-dimensional projection onto the orthogonal subspace. The high-dimensional projection is estimated via sparse regression and the linear functional is cast as a robust location estimation problem. Existing robust estimators turn out to be suboptimal, and we show a kernel mode estimator with a widening bandwidth exploits the Gaussian character of the data to achieve the optimal estimation rate.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-based Effect Measures for Compositional Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing effect measures for compositional features are inadequate for many modern applications for two reasons. First, modern datasets with compositional covariates, for example in microbiome research, display traits such as high-dimensionality and sparsity that can be poorly modelled with traditional parametric approaches. Second, assessing -- in an unbiased way -- how summary statistics of a composition (e.g., racial diversity) affect a response variable is not straightforward. In this work, we propose a framework based on hypothetical data perturbations that addresses both issues. Unlike many existing effect measures for compositional features, we do not define our effects based on a parametric model or a transformation of the data. Instead, we use perturbations to define interpretable statistical functionals on the compositions themselves, which we call average perturbation effects. These effects naturally account for confounding that biases frequently used marginal dependence analyses. We show how average perturbation effects can be estimated efficiently by deriving a perturbation-dependent reparametrization and applying semiparametric estimation techniques. We analyze the proposed estimators empirically on simulated and semi-synthetic data and demonstrate advantages over existing techniques on data from New York schools and microbiome data. For all proposed estimators, we provide confidence intervals with uniform asymptotic coverage guarantees.</description>

      <title>Degree-heterogeneous Latent Class Analysis for High-dimensional Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18745v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latent class model is a widely used mixture model for multivariate discrete data. Besides the existence of qualitatively heterogeneous latent classes, real data often exhibit additional quantitative heterogeneity nested within each latent class. The modern latent class analysis also faces extra challenges, including the high-dimensionality, sparsity, and heteroskedastic noise inherent in discrete data. Motivated by these phenomena, we introduce the Degree-heterogeneous Latent Class Model and propose an easy-to-implement HeteroClustering algorithm for it. HeteroClustering uses heteroskedastic PCA with $\ell_2$ normalization to remove degree effects and perform clustering in the top singular subspace of the data matrix. We establish the result of exact clustering under minimal signal-to-noise conditions. We further investigate the estimation and inference of the high-dimensional continuous item parameters in the model, which are crucial to interpreting and finding useful markers for latent classes. We provide comprehensive procedures for global testing and multiple testing of these parameters with valid error controls. The superior performance of our methods is demonstrated through extensive simulations and applications to three diverse real-world datasets from political voting records, genetic variations, and single-cell sequencing.</description>

      <title>Statistical algorithms for low-frequency diffusion data: A PDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in a class of multi-dimensional diffusions in divergence form, from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity, we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of popular statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors, in which both the proposed optimisation and sampling schemes provide good numerical recovery. The reproducible code is available online at https://github.com/MattGiord/LF-Diffusion.</description>

      <title>Structural adaptation via directional regularity: rate accelerated estimation in multivariate functional data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce directional regularity, a new definition of anisotropy for multivariate functional data. Instead of taking the conventional view which determines anisotropy as a notion of smoothness along a dimension, directional regularity additionally views anisotropy through the lens of directions. We show that faster rates of convergence can be obtained through a change-of-basis by adapting to the directional regularity of a multivariate process. An algorithm for the estimation and identification of the change-of-basis matrix is constructed, made possible due to the replication structure of functional data. Non-asymptotic bounds are provided for our algorithm, supplemented by numerical evidence from an extensive simulation study. Possible applications of the directional regularity approach are discussed, and we advocate its consideration as a standard pre-processing step in multivariate functional data analysis.</description>

      <title>O(d/T) Convergence Theory for Diffusion Probabilistic Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models, which generate new data by learning to reverse a diffusion process that perturbs data from the target distribution into noise, have achieved remarkable success across various generative tasks. Despite their superior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often constrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal assumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of the score functions, the total variation distance between the target and generated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic factors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps. This result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment. Moreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate improves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data distribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image distributions. These results are achieved through a novel set of analytical tools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates at each step of the reverse process.</description>

      <title>Local Learning for Covariate Selection in Nonparametric Causal Effect Estimation with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from nonexperimental data is a fundamental problem in many fields of science. A key component of this task is selecting an appropriate set of covariates for confounding adjustment to avoid bias. Most existing methods for covariate selection often assume the absence of latent variables and rely on learning the global network structure among variables. However, identifying the global structure can be unnecessary and inefficient, especially when our primary interest lies in estimating the effect of a treatment variable on an outcome variable. To address this limitation, we propose a novel local learning approach for covariate selection in nonparametric causal effect estimation, which accounts for the presence of latent variables. Our approach leverages testable independence and dependence relationships among observed variables to identify a valid adjustment set for a target causal relationship, ensuring both soundness and completeness under standard assumptions. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Surrogates in Conformal Inference of Individual Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) is essential for personalized decision-making, yet causal inference has traditionally focused on aggregated treatment effects. While integrating conformal prediction with causal inference can provide valid uncertainty quantification for ITEs, the resulting prediction intervals are often excessively wide, limiting their practical utility. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{S}urrogate-assisted \underline{C}onformal \underline{I}nference for \underline{E}fficient I\underline{N}dividual \underline{C}ausal \underline{E}ffects (SCIENCE), a framework designed to construct more efficient prediction intervals for ITEs. SCIENCE accommodates the covariate shifts between source data and target data and applies to various data configurations, including semi-supervised and surrogate-assisted semi-supervised learning. Leveraging semi-parametric efficiency theory, SCIENCE produces rate double-robust prediction intervals under mild rate convergence conditions, permitting the use of flexible non-parametric models to estimate nuisance functions. We quantify efficiency gains by comparing semi-parametric efficiency bounds with and without the surrogates. Simulation studies demonstrate that our surrogate-assisted intervals offer substantial efficiency improvements over existing methods while maintaining valid group-conditional coverage. Applied to the phase 3 Moderna COVE COVID-19 vaccine trial, SCIENCE illustrates how multiple surrogate markers can be leveraged to generate more efficient prediction intervals.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates an asymptotically minimax optimal algorithm in the two-armed fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI) problem. Given two treatment arms, the objective is to identify the arm with the highest expected outcome through an adaptive experiment. We focus on the Neyman allocation, where treatment arms are allocated following the ratio of their outcome standard deviations. Our primary contribution is to prove the minimax optimality of the Neyman allocation for the simple regret, defined as the difference between the expected outcomes of the true best arm and the estimated best arm. Specifically, we first derive a minimax lower bound for the expected simple regret, which characterizes the worst-case performance achievable under the location-shift distributions, including Gaussian distributions. We then show that the simple regret of the Neyman allocation asymptotically matches this lower bound, including the constant term, not just the rate in terms of the sample size, under the worst-case distribution. Notably, our optimality result holds without imposing locality restrictions on the distribution, such as the local asymptotic normality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Neyman allocation reduces to the uniform allocation, i.e., the standard randomized controlled trial, under Bernoulli distributions.</description>
