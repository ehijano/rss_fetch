      <title>Complex Harmonic Capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of complex harmonic potential in a doubly connected condenser (capacitor) is introduced as an analogue of the real-valued potential of an electrostatic vector field. In this analogy the full differential of a complex potential plays the role of the gradient of the scalar potential in the theory of electrostatic. The main objective in the non-static fields is to rule out having the full differential vanish at some points. Nevertheless, there can be critical points where the Jacobian determinant of the differential turns into zero. The latter is in marked contrast to the case of real-valued potentials. Furthermore, the complex electric capacitor also admits an interpretation of the stored energy intensively studied in the theory of hyperelastic deformations.</description>

      <title>Refined Bohr inequalities and a refined Bohr-Rogosinski inequality on complex Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish refined versions of the Bohr inequalities for the class of holomorphic functions from the unit ball $B_X$ of a complex Banach space $X$ into $\mathbb{C}$. As applications, we will establish refined Bohr inequalities of functional type or of norm type for holomorphic mappings with lacunary series on the unit ball $B_X$ with values in higher dimensional spaces. Next, we obtain the Bohr-Rogosinski inequality for the class of holomorphic functions on $B_X.$ In addition, we establish an improved version of the Bohr inequality for holomorphic functions on $B_X$. All the results are proved to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Strong holomorphic Morse inequalities on non-compact complex manifolds with optimal fundamental estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish strong holomorphic Morse inequalities on non-compact manifolds under the condition of optimal fundamental estimates. We show that optimal fundamental estimates are satisfied and then strong holomorphic Morse inequalities hold true in various settings.</description>

      <title>Continuity of Solutions to Complex Hessian Equations via the Dinew-Ko{\l}odziej Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the celebrated volume-capacity estimates of Dinew and Kolodziej, providing a foundation for examining the regularity of solutions to boundary value problems for complex Hessian equations. By integrating the techniques established by Dinew and Kolodziej and incorporating recent advances by Charabati and Zeriahi, we demonstrate the continuity of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Solving the Wave Equation on Discrete Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to an initial value problem for the 1-dimensional wave equation on time scales through the application of a Fourier transform and its inverse via contour integrals. The time scale of the spatial dimension is set to the integers and a broader class of discrete time scales, while the time dimension is set to the positive real numbers.</description>

      <title>Braid monodromy for a trinomial algebraic equation by means of Mellin-Barnes integral representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a braid monodromy representation of functions satisfying an algebraic equation containing three terms (trinomial equation). We follow global analytic continuation of the roots to a trinomial algebraic equation that are expressed by Mellin-Barnes integral representations. We depict braids that arise from the monodromy around all branching points. The global braid monodromy is described in terms of rational twists of strands that yield a classical Artin braid representation of algebraic functions. As a corollary, we get a precise description of the Galois group of a trinomial algebraic equation.</description>

      <title>Forward operator monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies collections of Hilbert space operators which possess a strict monoid structure under composition. These collections can be thought of as discrete unital semigroups for which no subset of the collection is closed under composition (apart from the trivial subset containing only the identity). We call these collections $\textit{forward operator monoids}$. Although not traditionally painted in this light, monoids of this flavor appear in many areas of analysis; as we shall see, they are intimately linked to several well-known problems. The main aim of this work is to study three classes of vectors associated to a given operator monoid: cyclic vectors, generalized inner vectors, and vectors which are both cyclic and inner (we refer to this last class as aleph vectors). We show, when they exist, aleph vectors are unique up to a multiplicative constant. We also show, under the lens of a least-squares problem, how an aleph vector can be used to characterize all cyclic and inner vectors. As an application of this theory, we consider monoids related to the Periodic Dilation Completeness Problem and the Riemann Hypothesis. After recovering some known results, we conclude by giving a further reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis based on works of B\'{a}ez-Duarte and Noor.</description>

      <title>The Leray transform: distinguished measures, symmetries and polygamma inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New symmetries, norm computations and spectral information are obtained for the Leray transform on a class of unbounded hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^2$. Emphasis is placed on certain distinguished measures, with results on operator norm monotonicity established by proving new polygamma inequalities. Classical techniques of Bernstein-Widder and Euler-Maclaurin play crucial roles in our analysis. Underpinning this work is a projective geometric theory of duality, which manifests here in the form of H\"older invariance.</description>

      <title>The CFT of SLE loop measures and the Kontsevich--Suhov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the conformal field theory of the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure $\nu$ for $\kappa\in(0,4]$, the range where the loop is almost surely simple. First, we construct two commuting representations $(\mathbf{L}_n,\bar{\mathbf{L}}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_\mathrm{M}=1-6(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa}}-\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}}{2})^2\leq1$ as (unbounded) first order differential operators on $L^2(\nu)$. Second, we introduce highest-weight representations and characterise their structure: in particular, we prove the existence of vanishing singular vectors at arbitrary levels on the Kac table. Third, we prove an integration by parts formula for the SLE loop measure, and use it to define the Shapovalov form of the representation, a non degenerate (but \emph{not} positive definite) Hermitian form $\mathcal{Q}$ on $L^2(\nu)$ with a remarkably simple geometric expression. The fact that $\mathcal{Q}$ differs from the $L^2(\nu)$-inner product is a manifestation of non-unitarity. Finally, we write down a spectral resolution of $\mathcal{Q}$ using the joint diagonalisation of $\mathbf{L}_0$ and $\bar{\mathbf{L}}_0$. As an application of these results, we provide the first proof of the uniqueness of restriction measures, as conjectured by Kontsevich and Suhov.
  Our results lay the groundwork for an in-depth study of the CFT of SLE: in forthcoming works, we will define correlation functions on Riemann surfaces, and prove conformal Ward identities, BPZ equations, and conformal bootstrap formulas.</description>
