      <title>A Detection of Helium in the Bright Superluminous Supernova SN 2024rmj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN2024rmj at z = 0.1189. SN 2024rmj reached a peak absolute magnitude of Mg $\approx$ -21.9, placing it at the luminous end of the SLSN-I distribution. The light curve exhibits a pronounced pre-peak bump ($\approx$ 60 d before the main peak) and a post-peak bump ($\approx$ 55 d after the main peak). The bulk of the light curve is otherwise well fit by a magnetar spin-down model, with typical values (spin: $\approx$ 2.1 ms; magnetic field: $\approx$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ G; ejecta mass: $\approx$ 12 M$_\odot$). The optical spectra exhibit characteristic SLSN-I features and evolution, but with a relatively high velocity of $\approx$ 8,000 km s$^{-1}$ post-peak. Most significantly, we find a clear detection of helium in the NIR spectra at He I $\lambda$1.083 $\mu$m and $\lambda$2.058 $\mu$m, blueshifted by $\approx$ 15,000 km s$^{-1}$ (13 d before peak) and $\approx$ 13,000 km s$^{-1}$ (40 d after peak), indicating that helium is confined to the outermost ejecta; based on these NIR detections, we also identify likely contribution from He I $\lambda$5876 \r{A} in the optical spectra on a similar range of timescales. This represents the most definitive detection of helium in a bright SLSN-I to date, and indicates that progenitors with a thin helium layer can still explode as SLSNe.</description>

      <title>Searching for Historical Extragalactic Optical Transients Associated with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for past supernovae (SNe) and other historical optical transients at the positions of fast radio burst (FRB) sources to test FRB progenitor systems. Our sample comprises 83 FRBs detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and its KKO Outrigger, along with 93 literature FRBs representing all known well-localized FRBs. We search for optical transients coincident in position and redshift with FRBs and find no significant associations within the 5-sigma FRB localization uncertainties except for a previously identified potential optical counterpart to FRB 20180916B. By constraining the timescale for SN ejecta to become transparent to FRB emission, we predict that it takes at least 6-10 years before the FRB emission can escape. From this, we infer that approximately 7% of matched optical transients, up to 30% of currently known SNe, and up to 40% of core-collapse SNe could have an observable FRB based on timescales alone. We derive the number of new, well-localized FRBs required to produce one FRB-SN match by chance, and find it will take ~ 22,700 FRBs to yield one chance association at the projected CHIME/FRB Outrigger detection rate. Looking forward, we demonstrate redshift overlap between SNe detected by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and CHIME/FRB Outrigger FRBs, indicating the prospect of an increase in potential associations at redshift z &lt; 1. Our framework is publicly available, flexible to a wide range of transient timescales and FRB localization sizes, and can be applied to any optical transient populations in future searches.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD reveals the softening of matter in the cores of massive neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cores of neutron stars (NSs) contain the densest matter in the universe. Rapid advancements in neutron-star observations allow unprecedented empirical access to cold, ultra-dense Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter. The combination of these observations with theoretical calculations has revealed previously inaccessible features of the equation of state (EoS) and the QCD phase diagram. In this thesis, I demonstrate how perturbative-QCD calculations at asymptotically high baryon densities provide robust constraints on the EoS at neutron-star densities. The method for constraint propagation is based solely on thermodynamical causality, stability, and consistency of the EoS. By constructing a large ensemble of EoSs using Gaussian processes regression and incorporating it into a Bayesian inference of EoS, I demonstrate that the novel pQCD constraints go beyond those obtained from current astrophysical observations alone, forcing the EoS to soften at the maximum densities of stable neutron stars. This softening of the EoS can be interpreted as an indication of approximate conformal symmetry restoration, a sign of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), or potentially both. I show that the conformal symmetry restoration is consistent with the hypothesis of quark matter cores inside the most massive NSs. Although current astrophysical data and theoretical inputs cannot definitively distinguish between the two scenarios, they slightly favor the occurrence of a phase transition of some kind - whether a crossover to quark matter or a destabilizing FOPT - in the cores of the most massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>LHAASO Protons versus LHAASO Diffuse Gamma Rays: A Consistency Check</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first direct consistency check between the recently measured proton spectrum at the knee by LHAASO and the collaboration's own high-precision mapping of Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission. By modeling the hadronic gamma-ray production using the updated cosmic-ray spectra, gas templates and cross-section models, we show that the predicted gamma-ray flux robustly overshoots the LHAASO data in both inner and lateral Galactic regions. This persistent mismatch in both normalization and spectral shape challenges conventional scenarios linking the local cosmic-ray sea to Galactic gamma-ray emission, and calls for a revision of current cosmic ray models in the TeV-PeV sky.</description>

      <title>Comparative Testing of Subgrid Models for Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions in Core-collapse Supernova Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate key methodologies of Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook subgrid modeling for neutrino fast flavor conversions (FFC) in core-collapse supernova based on spherically symmetric Boltzmann radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We first examine time integration methods (explicit, implicit, or semi-implicit) and time step control for the subgrid term, and then compare various approaches in the literature approximating FFCs in two aspects: (1) angular dependent survival probability of neutrinos versus simple equipartition condition with a certain baryon mass density threshold, and (2) 4-species treatment versus 3-species assumption ($\nu_x=\bar\nu_x$). We find that the equipartition condition is reasonable for out-going neutrinos, but large deviations emerge in the incoming neutrinos, that has an influence on matter profiles. We also find that the 3-species model, in which flavor conversions evolve towards erasing electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossings, behave differently from the 4-species models where heavy leptonic neutrino number (XLN) are appropriately treated in FFC subgrid modeling. In 4-species models, we commonly observe noticeable differences between $\nu_x$ and $\bar\nu_x$, highlighting the limitation in 3-species treatments to study impacts of flavor conversion on neutrino signals. Our result also suggests that FFC models yield lower neutrino heating rate and smaller shock radii compared to cases with no FFC, in agreement with earlier studies employing quantum kinetic neutrino transport. This work provides valuable information towards robust implementation of FFC subgrid model into classical transport, and serves as a pilot study for future multi-dimensional simulations.</description>

      <title>Results from the Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae: Contamination by Massive Stellar Outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the Pan-STARRS optical search for kilonovae without the aid of gravitational wave and gamma-ray burst triggers. The search was conducted from 26 October 2019 to 15 December 2022. During this time, we reported 29,740 transients observed by Pan-STARRS to the IAU Transient Name Server. Of these, 175 were Pan-STARRS credited discoveries that had a host galaxy within 200 Mpc and had discovery absolute magnitudes M &gt; -16.5. A subset of 11 transients was plausibly identified as kilonova candidates by our kilonova prediction algorithm. Through a combination of historical forced photometry, extensive follow-up, and aggregating observations from multiple sky surveys, we eliminated all as kilonova candidates. Rapidly evolving outbursts from massive stars (likely to be Luminous Blue Variable eruptions) accounted for 55% of the subset's contaminating sources. We estimate the rate of such eruptions using the ATLAS 100 Mpc volume-limited survey data. As these outbursts appear to be significant contaminants in kilonova searches, we estimate contaminating numbers when searching gravitational wave skymaps produced by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra science collaboration during the Rubin era. The Legacy Survey of Space and time, reaching limiting magnitudes of m = 25, could detect 2-6 massive stellar outbursts per 500 deg^2 within a 4-day observing window, within the skymaps and volumes typical for binary neutron star mergers projected for Ligo-Virgo-Kagra Observing run 5. We conclude that while they may be a contaminant, they can be photometrically identified.</description>

      <title>The initial evolution of SN 1993J: Piston phase versus standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of SN 1993J is unlikely to be self-similar. Spatially resolved VLBI-observations show that the velocity of the outer rim of the radio emission region brakes at a few hundred days. The reason for this break remains largely unknown. It is argued here that it is due to the transition between an initial piston phase to a later phase, which is described by the standard model. The properties of the reverse shock are quite different for a piston phase as compared to the standard self-similar model. This affects the expected X-ray emission; for example, the reverse shock becomes transparent to X-ray emission much earlier in the piston phase. Furthermore, it is shown that the observed box-like emission line profiles of H_alpha and other optical lines are consistent with an origin from the transition region between the envelope and the core. It is also pointed out that identifying the observed, simultaneous breaks at approximately 3100 days in the radio and X-ray light curves with the reverse shock reaching the core, makes it possible to directly relate the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star to observables.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Energy Distribution Variability Study of the Eclipsing AGN NGC 6814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local Seyfert 1.5 active galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 6814, is known to exhibit complex variability, eclipses, and even changing-look behaviour. In this work, we utilize optical-to-X-ray data obtained over 10-years with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to examine the short-term (i.e. daily) and long-term (yearly) variations in the spectral energy distribution (SED). This includes three epochs of high-cadence monitoring (2012, 2016, and 2022), as well as two single observations (2019 and 2021). Model-independent methods of examining the variability suggest that the three monitored epochs exhibit distinct behaviour. X-ray weakness in 2016 can be attributed to the previously studied eclipses, while similar behaviour in 2012 is associated with continuum changes and slight neutral absorption. The multi-epoch SED models are consistent with a black hole (log (MBH / Msun) ~7.6) that is accreting between 0.01-0.1 of the Eddington rate. While the corona (primary X-ray source) is compact, all epochs are better fit with an accretion disk inner radius that is much larger than the innermost stable circular orbit, implying the possibility of a non-standard accretion disk or central structure in NGC 6814.</description>

      <title>XRISM Spectroscopy of the Stellar-Mass Black Hole 4U 1630-472 in Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on XRISM/Resolve spectroscopy of the recurrent transient and well-known black hole candidate 4U 1630$-$472 during its 2024 outburst. The source was captured at the end of a disk-dominated high/soft state, at an Eddington fraction of $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd} \sim 0.05~(10 M_{\odot}/M_\mathrm{BH})$. A variable absorption spectrum with unprecedented complexity is revealed with the Resolve calorimeter. This marks one of the lowest Eddington fractions at which highly ionized absorption has been detected in an X-ray binary. The strongest lines are fully resolved, with He-like Fe XXV separated into resonance and intercombination components, and H-like Fe XXVI seen as a spin-orbit doublet. The depth of some absorption lines varied by almost an order of magnitude, far more than expected based on a 10% variation in apparent X-ray flux and ionization parameter. The velocity of some absorption components also changed significantly. Jointly modeling two flux segments with a consistent model including four photoionization zones, the spectrum can be described in terms of highly ionized but likely failed winds that sometimes show red-shifts, variable obscuration that may signal asymmetric structures in the middle and outer accretion disk, and a tentative very fast outflow ($v = 0.026-0.033c$). We discuss the impact of these findings on our understanding of accretion and winds in stellar-mass black holes, and potential consequences for future studies.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Downward-going Milli-charged particles beyond GZK cutoff at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is assumed that superheavy dark matter particles (SHDM, $\phi$) with $\mathcal{O}$(ZeV) mass may decay to relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs, $\chi$) via a channel $\phi\to\chi\bar{\chi}$ or $\gamma\chi\bar{\chi}$. The downward-going MCPs passing through the atmosphere can be measured by the Pierre Auger observatory (Auger). The massless hidden photon model is taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that we evaluated the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs at Auger assuming 14 years of Auger data. The hybrid data of Auger was fitted with the flux of UHE MCPs exceeding GZK-cutoff energy. Then the corresponding upper limits on $\epsilon^2$ are calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicate that MCPs can be directly detected with $\epsilon^2\gtrsim 2\times10^{-6}$ at Auger, when $m_{\phi}=2\times10^{21}$ eV and $\tau_{\phi}=10^{27}$ s. And a new region of 10$^{9.6}$ &lt; $m_{MCP}$ &lt; 10$^{11.6}$ eV and $\epsilon$ &gt; $2.12\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 14 years of Auger data. These results indicate potential existence of MCPs and SHDM in the Universe.</description>

      <title>100,000 Crab giant pulses at 215 MHz detected with an SKA-Low prototype station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report detection and analysis of the largest low-frequency (200 - 231.25 MHz) sample of Crab giant pulses (GPs) reported in the literature. In total about 95000 GPs were detected. The observations were performed in 2024/2025 with the EDA2, a prototype station of the SKA-Low telescope. The fluence distribution of GPs in the entire sample is very well characterised with a single power law (no flattening at higher fluences) N(F) $\propto$ F$^\alpha$, where $\alpha = -3.17\pm0.02$ for all GPs, and $\alpha_{MP} = -3.13\pm0.02$ and $\alpha_{IP} = -3.59\pm0.06$ for GPs at the phases of the main pulse and interpulse respectively. The index of the power law fluence distribution remained approximately constant over the observing period, but the normalisation of the distribution was strongly correlated with the scatter broadening time ($\tau$). As a result, the measured fluence distribution increased for lower ($\tau \approx$ 2 ms) and decreased for higher ($\tau \approx$ 5 ms) scatter broadening time $\tau$ causing the GP rate to vary between 3000 and 100 per hour respectively. The timescale of variations (weeks) indicates refractive scintillation as the root cause. We also observe a strong positive correlation between the scatter broadening time and dispersion measure. Our modelling favours the screen of the size $\sim10^{-5}$ pc and mean electron density $\sim 400$e$^{-}$cm$^{-3}$ located within 100 pc from the pulsar. The frequency scaling of the scattering broadening time ($\tau \propto \nu^{\beta}$) with $\beta \approx -3.6\pm0.1$ is in agreement with earlier measurements. Our results agree with the current views that GPs from extra-galactic Crab-like pulsars can be responsible for very weak repeating FRBs, but cannot explain the entire FRB population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enormous scientific potential of individual SKA-Low stations.</description>

      <title>Peering into the heart of 3CR radio galaxies. A very long baseline interferometry perspective on optical-radio classifications at parsec scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, luminous edge-brightened Fanaroff-Riley type II (FRII) radio galaxies have been associated with radiatively efficient cold accretion disks. In contrast, faint edge-darkened Fanaroff-Riley Type Is (FRIs) are sustained by hot, inefficient accretion flows. However, several sources deviate from this paradigm, showing FRII morphologies and radiatively inefficient accretion. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the observations: (1) The evolutionary scenario: initially strong accretor FRIIs switch to having a hot inefficient flow due to the depletion of available material. (2) The environment scenario: radio structures are mainly shaped by the environment.\ (3) The engine scenario: both radiatively efficient (FRII-HERGs) and inefficient flows (FRII-LERGs) can expel jets powerful enough to maintain collimation up to kiloparsec distances from the nucleus. We explored these scenarios by studying the jet properties of 3CR radio galaxies using very long baseline interferometry data from the Fundamental Radio Catalog to investigate the distinction between FRII-LERGs and FRII-HERGs. In particular, we analyzed the 8 GHz luminosity ($L_{8GHz}$) distribution across different optical-radio classes at milliarcsecond scales. Our results favor the engine scenario. The separation between different radio-optical classes is evident even on parsec scales. In particular, the separation between FRII classes with different accretion rates occurs near the central engine before the jets reach kiloparsec-scale distances.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Radio Monitoring of the Black Hole X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023$-$2024 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents comprehensive multi-frequency radio monitoring of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613, which underwent its first recorded outburst after its discovery in August 2023. Through a considerable community effort, we have coalesced the data from multiple, distinct observing programs; the light curves include ${\sim} 10$ months and 197 epochs of monitoring from 7 radio facilities with observing frequencies ranging from (approximately) 0.3$-$230GHz. The primary purpose of this work is to provide the broader astronomical community with these light curves to assist with the interpretation of other observing campaigns, particularly non-radio observing frequencies. We discuss the phenomenological evolution of the source, which included: (i) multiple radio flares consistent with the launching of discrete jet ejections, the brightest of which reached $\sim$ 1 Jy; (ii) temporally evolving radio spectral indices ($\alpha$), reaching values steeper than expected for optically-thin synchrotron emission ($\alpha {&lt;} -1$) and emission with significant radiative cooling ($\alpha &lt; -1.5$). We have published a digital copy of the data and intend for this work to set a precedent for the community to continue releasing comprehensive radio light curves of future low-mass X-ray binary outbursts.</description>

      <title>The FAST Globular Cluster Pulsar Survey (GC FANS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07970v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By January 2025, 60 pulsars were discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope globular cluster (GC) pulsar survey (GC FANS), with spin periods spanning 1.98 ms to 3960.72 ms. Of these, 55 are millisecond pulsars (MSPs; $P&lt;30$ ms), while 34 are binaries with orbital periods spanning 0.12 days to 466.47 days. This paper describes GC FANS, a deep, thorough search for pulsars in 41 GCs in the FAST sky ($-14^\circ &lt; \delta &lt; 65^\circ$) and describes new discoveries in 14 of them. We present updated timing solutions for M92A, NGC 6712A, M71A, and M71E, all of which are ``spider'' pulsars with short orbital periods. We present new timing solutions for M71B, C, and D. With orbital periods of $\sim$466 and 378 days, M71B and M71C are the widest known GC binaries; these systems resemble the normal wide MSP-He WD systems in the Galactic disk. With a spin period of 101 ms, M71D is in an eccentric ($e\sim$0.63) orbit with an 11-day period and a massive companion; the system has a total mass of $2.63 \pm 0.08 \, M_{\odot}$. These features and its large characteristic age suggest it is a double neutron star system (DNS) formed via massive binary evolution early in the cluster's history, akin to Galactic disk DNSs--unlike other candidate GC DNSs, which typically form dynamically. A comparative analysis of GC pulsar populations within FAST's sky reveals that most clusters (10 of 14) resemble the Galactic disk MSP population, likely due to lower stellar densities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Particle Creation by Cosmic Strings in de Sitter Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the phenomenon of particle creation associated with cosmic strings in de Sitter spacetime, a model that represents the universe exponential expansion. We examine how the presence of cosmic strings in a de Sitter background affects particle production, focusing on the roles of string tension and angular deficits. Utilizing the Klein Gordon equation adapted to curved spacetime with cosmic string defects, we derive solutions expressed through hypergeometric functions to describe particle states. Our findings highlight how string properties influence particle creation rates and energy distributions. By analyzing both point-like and linear potentials near the string, we determine exact solutions, investigate asymptotic behaviors, and calculate particle creation probabilities using Bogoliubov transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos from blazars can originate from inelastic scatterings between protons within their jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around them, explaining IceCube detections of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 that are otherwise challenging for models of its jet. In this paper we calculate such DM-induced high-energy neutrinos, from TXS 0506+056 as well as from a stacked blazar sample, in the four cases where DM-quark interactions are mediated by a new massive vector, axial, scalar, and pseudoscalar particle. Intriguingly, we find that this mechanism can saturate the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube at high energies. Our mechanism will be tested by additional blazar observations and by various searches for sub-GeV DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for massive star evolution that is no longer driven by Dutch or other mass-loss rate Recipes, but which take the physics of Gamma or L/M dependent mass loss consistently into account. We first discuss the hot-star mass-loss kink and the transition mass loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before discussing vertical stellar evolution, mass evaporation, and the maximum black hole (BH) mass. We end with a suggestion that a recently uncovered red supergiant (RSG) kink might be related to similar underlying L/M physics as the hot-star kink.</description>

      <title>Black-hole hair from vector dark matter accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model a single black hole in equilibrium with a dark photon-cold dark matter environment. Representing the dark photon as a Proca field, we show that a Schwarzschild black hole grows vector-field "hair" when allowed to accrete from an infinite homogeneous bath of particles far from the horizon. We solve the Proca equation in linear perturbation theory, separating it using the vector spherical harmonics and Frolov-Krtou\v{s}-Kubiz\v{n}\'{a}k-Santos approaches for the odd-parity and even-parity sectors, respectively. In the "particle" dark matter regime, the field is purely infalling and exhibits a sharply peaked density profile, in concordance with the particle dark matter "spikes" studied in the literature. In the "wave" regime, the field exhibits standing waves, and the profile is smeared. We find a dark-matter density amplification upward of $10^7$ near the horizon. Though small for most black holes, we find the mass enclosed in the cloud can reach $\sim 1 \%$ of the black hole mass for large supermassive black holes. These black holes are also most susceptible to vector dark matter accretion, with mass accretion rates as large as $10 M_\odot/$yr.</description>

      <title>Energy partition in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a simple and straightforward method to derive the energy partition in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence that was first studied by Lee and then more rigorously by Chandrasekhar. By investigating the energy equation we find that the turbulent viscous and ohmic dissipations are comparable to each other. Under the condition that turbulent viscosity and turbulent magnetic diffusivity are comparable, we deduce that the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies depends on the ratio of the turbulent magnetic lengthscale to turbulent velocity lengthscale of the largest eddies. When the two largest lengthscales are comparable, the two energies are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>Echo mapping of the black hole accretion flow in NGC 7469</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping (RM) can measure black hole accretion disc sizes and radial structure through observed time lags that should increase with wavelength as $\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$. Our 250-day RM campaign on NGC 7469 combines sub-day cadence 7-band photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory robotic telescopes and weekly X-ray and UVOT data from Swift. By fitting these light curves, we measure the spectral energy distribution of the variable accretion disc and inter-band lags of just 1.5 days across the UV to the optical range. The disc SED is close to the expected $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$, and the lags are consistent with $\tau\propto \lambda^{4/3}$, but three times larger than expected. We consider several possible modifications to standard disc assumptions. First, for a $9\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ black hole and 2 possible spins $a^\star=(0,1)$, we fit the X-ray-UV-optical SED with a compact relativistic corona at height $H_x=(46,27)R_g$ irradiating a flat disc with accretion rate $\dot{m}_{Edd}\sim(0.23,0.24)$ inclined to the line of sight by $i&lt;20^\circ$. To fit the lags as well as the SED, this model requires a low spin $a^\star=0$ and boosts disc color temperatures by a factor $f_{col}=1.8$, which shifts reprocessed light to shorter wavelengths. Our Bowl model with $f_{col}=1$ neglects relativity near the black hole but fits the UV-optical lags and SEDs using a flat disc with $\dot{m}_{Edd}&lt;0.06$ and a steep outer rim at $R_{out}/c\sim5-10$ days with H/R&lt;1%. This rim occurs near the $10^3$K dust sublimation temperature in the disc atmosphere, supporting models that invoke dust opacity to thicken the disc and launch failed radiatively-driven dusty outflows at the inner edge of the broad line region (BLR). Finally, the disc lags and SEDs exhibit a significant excess in the $u$ and $r$ bands, suggesting the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$ emission, respectively, from the BLR.</description>

      <title>A Composite Broad-Line Region in SDSS J1609+4902: a Double-Peaked Disk component and a Gaussian Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profiles of broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide critical insights into the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR), which in turn influence the uncertainties in estimating the masses of central supermassive black holes. In this study, we report the discovery of a low-luminosity AGN, SDSS J1609+4902, in which the H$\alpha$ line exhibits two distinct BLR components: a Gaussian component and an extremely broad double-peaked component. Follow-up observations conducted at the Lijiang Observatory in 2025 reveal that the line profile remains roughly unchanged, suggesting that this BLR structure may remain stable over a timescale of $\sim$10 years. We find that the size of the central Gaussian (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM$\sim 3000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) component is consistent with the classical reverberation mapping correlation. In contrast, the asymmetric double-peaked wing (FWHM$\sim 23,000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$) likely originates from a disk-like BLR with an inner radius of approximately 70 gravitational radii. These results provide new constraints on the structure and dynamics of BLRs in AGNs and highlight the potential for long-term stability in such systems.</description>

      <title>Density jump as a function of the field for parallel relativistic collisionless shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are frequently analyzed using the magnetohydrodynamic formalism (MHD), even though the required collisionality hypothesis is not fulfilled. In a previous work \citep{BretJPP2018}, we presented a model of collisionless shock displaying an important departure from the expected MHD behavior, in the case of a strong flow aligned magnetic field. This model was non-relativistic. Here, it is extended to the relativistic regime, considering zero upstream pressure and upstream Lorentz factor $\gg 1$. The result agrees satisfactorily with Particle-in-Cell simulations and shows a similar, and important, departure from the MHD prediction. In the strong field regime, the density jump $r$, seen in the downstream frame, behaves like $r \sim 2 + 1/\gamma_{\mathrm{up}}$ while MHD predicts 4 ($\gamma_{\mathrm{up}}$ is the Lorentz factor of the upstream measured in the downstream frame). Only pair plasmas are considered.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en Wave Conversion to Low Frequency Fast Magnetosonic Waves in Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid shear motion of magnetar crust can launch Alfv\'{e}n waves into the magnetosphere. The dissipation of the Alfv\'{e}n waves has been theorized to power the X-ray bursts characteristic of magnetars. However, the process by which Alfv\'{e}n waves convert their energy to X-rays is unclear. Recent work has suggested that energetic fast magnetosonic (fast) waves can be produced as a byproduct of Alfv\'{e}n waves propagating on curved magnetic field lines; their subsequent dissipation may power X-ray bursts. In this work, we investigate the production of fast waves by performing axisymmetric force-free simulations of Alfv\'{e}n waves propagating in a dipolar magnetosphere. For Alfv\'{e}n wave trains that do not completely fill the flux tube confining them, we find a fast wave dominated by a low frequency component with a wavelength defined by the bouncing time of the Alfv\'{e}n waves. In contrast, when the wave train is long enough to completely fill the flux tube, and the Alfv\'{e}n waves overlap significantly, the energy is quickly converted into a fast wave with a higher frequency that corresponds to twice the Alfv\'{e}n wave frequency. We investigate how the energy, duration, and wavelength of the initial Alfv\'{e}n wave train affect the conversion efficiency to fast waves. For modestly energetic star quakes, we see that the fast waves that are produced will become non-linear well within the magnetosphere, and we comment on the X-ray emission that one may expect from such events.</description>

      <title>Analysis of optical spectroscopy and photometry of the type I X-ray bursting system UW CrB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UW Coronae Borealis (UW CrB) is a low mass X-ray binary that shows both Type 1 X-ray and optical bursts, which typically last for 20 s. The system has a binary period of close to 2 hours and is thought to have a relatively high inclination due to the presence of an eclipse in the optical light curve. There is also evidence that an asymmetric disc is present in the system, which precesses every 5.5 days based on changes in the depth of the eclipse. In this paper, we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of UW CrB taken over 2 years. We update the orbital ephemeris using observed optical eclipses and refine the orbital period to 110.97680(1) min. A total of 17 new optical bursts are presented, with 10 of these bursts being resolved temporally. The average $e$-folding time of $19\pm3$s for the bursts is consistent with the previously found value. Optical bursts are observed during a previously identified gap in orbital phase centred on $\phi=0.967$, meaning the reprocessing site is not eclipsed as previously thought. Finally, we find that the apparent P-Cygni profiles present in some of the atomic lines in the optical spectra are due to transient absorption.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flare GRB 231115A: Insights from Fermi/GBM Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the detection and analysis of GRB 231115A, a candidate extragalactic magnetar giant flare (MGF) observed by Fermi/GBM and localized by INTEGRAL to the starburst galaxy M82. This burst exhibits distinctive temporal and spectral characteristics that align with known MGFs, including a short duration and a high peak energy. Gamma-ray analyses reveal significant insights into this burst, supporting conclusions already established in the literature: our time-resolved spectral studies provide further evidence that GRB 231115A is indeed a MGF. Significance calculations also suggest a robust association with M82, further supported by a high Bayes factor that minimizes the probability of chance alignment with a neutron star merger. Despite extensive follow-up efforts, no contemporaneous gravitational wave or radio emissions were detected. The lack of radio emission sets stringent upper limits on possible radio luminosity. Constraints from our analysis show no fast radio bursts (FRBs) associated with two MGFs. X-ray observations conducted post-burst by Swift/XRT and XMM/Newton provided additional data, though no persistent counterparts were identified. Our study underscores the importance of coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up and highlights the potential of MGFs to enhance our understanding of short GRBs and magnetar activities in the cosmos. Current MGF identification and follow-up implementation are insufficient for detecting expected counterparts; however, improvements in these areas may allow for the recovery of follow-up signals with existing instruments. Future advancements in observational technologies and methodologies will be crucial in furthering these studies.</description>

      <title>SgrA* spin and mass estimates through the detection of multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the parameter estimation accuracy that can be achieved for the mass and spin of SgrA$^\ast$, the SMBH in our Galactic Center, by detecting multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs). XMRIs are formed by brown dwarfs (BD) inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), thus emitting gravitational waves (GWs) inside the detection band of future space-based detectors such as LISA and TianQin. Theoretical estimates suggest the presence of approximately 10 XMRIs emitting detectable GWs, making them some of the most promising candidates for space-based GW detectors. Our analysis indicates that even if individual sources have low SNRs ($\approx10$), high-precision parameter estimates can still be achieved by detecting multiple sources. In this case, the accuracy of the parameter estimates increases by approximately one to two orders of magnitude, at least. Moreover, by analyzing a small sample of 400 initial conditions for XMRIs formed in the Galactic Center, we estimate that almost 80\,\% of the detectable XMRIs orbiting SgrA$^\ast$ will have eccentricities between 0.43 to 0.95 and an $\mathrm{SNR}\in [10,100]$. The remaining $\sim$20\,\% of the sources have an $\mathrm{SNR}\in [100,1000]$ and eccentricities ranging from 0.25 to 0.92. Additionally, some XMRIs with high SNR are far from being circular. These loud sources with $\mathrm{SNR}\approx 1000$ can have eccentricities as high as $e\approx0.7$; although their detection chances are low, representing $\lesssim$2\,\% of the detectable sources, their presence is not ruled out.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray emission from decays of boosted nuclei in protomagnetar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the detectability of $\gamma$-ray emission originating from the radioactive decays of unstable nuclei that are synthesized in relativistic outflows launched in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae. The observed lines have enhanced energies due to the Lorentz boosted nuclei and can also be seen until later times due to time dilation of the rest-frame half-lives. We find that instruments like \textit{e-ASTROGAM} and \textit{INTEGRAL/SPI} are sensitive to these boosted line emissions from hundreds of keV to tens of MeV at a distance of 10 kpc over timescales of tens of days. For favorable viewing angles, these decays can be detected to extragalactic distances for rapidly spinning protomagnetar models. On the other hand, detection for off-axis jets is challenging, even for a supernova at the Galactic Center. Measuring multiple decay lines in addition to the integrated luminosity over $\sim10$ days postbounce would allow for the ability to distinguish between models and shed light on central engine properties like magnetic field and spin.</description>

      <title>Long-term impact of the magnetic-field strength on the evolution and electromagnetic emission by neutron-star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential to understand the complex physics accompanying the merger of binary systems of neutron stars. However, these simulations become computationally challenging when they have to model the merger remnants on timescales over which secular phenomena, such as the launching of magnetically driven outflows, develop. To tackle these challenges, we have recently developed a hybrid approach that combines, via a hand-off transition, a fully general-relativistic code (FIL) with a more efficient code making use of the conformally flat approximation (BHAC+). We here report important additional developments of BHAC+ consisting of the inclusion of gravitational-wave radiation-reaction contributions and of higher-order formulations of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Both improvements have allowed us to explore BNS merger remnants with high accuracy and over timescales that would have been computationally prohibitive otherwise. More specifically, we have investigated the impact of the magnetic-field strength on the long-term (i.e., $\sim 200\,{\rm ms}$) and high-resolution (i.e., $150\,{\rm m}$) evolutions of the "magnetar" resulting from the merger of two neutron stars with a realistic equation of state. In this way, and for sufficiently large magnetic fields, we observe the weakening or suppression of differential rotation and the generation of magnetic flares in the outer layers of the remnant. These flares, driven mostly by the Parker instability, are responsible for intense and collimated Poynting flux outbursts and mass ejections. This novel phenomenology offers the possibility of seeking corresponding signatures from the observations of short gamma-ray bursts and hence revealing the existence of a long-lived strongly magnetized remnant.</description>

      <title>Hyper-active repeating fast radio bursts from rotation modulated starquakes on magnetars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-detection of periodicity related to rotation challenges magnetar models for fast radio bursts (FRBs) with FRB emission from close to the magnetar surface. Moreover, a bimodal distribution of the burst waiting times is widely observed in hyper-active FRBs, a significant deviation from the exponential distribution expected from stationary Poisson processes. By combining the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) earthquake model and the rotating vector model (RVM) involving the rotation of the magnetar and orientations of the spin and magnetic axes, we find that starquake events modulated by the rotation of FRB-emitting magnetar can explain the bimodal distribution of FRB waiting times, as well as the non-detection of periodicity in hyper-active repeating FRBs. We analyze data from multiple FRB sources, demonstrating that differences in waiting time distributions and, to some extent, observed energies can be explained by varying parameters related to geometric properties of the magnetar FRB emission and starquake dynamics. Our results show that the assumption that all FRBs are repeaters is compatible with our model. Notably, we find that hyper-active repeaters tend to have small magnetic inclination angles in order to hide their periodicity. We also show that our model can reproduce the waiting time distribution of a pulsar phase of the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 with a larger inclination angle than the hyper-active repeaters, which could explain the detection of spin period and the relatively low observed energy for FRBs from the magnetar. The spin periods of hyper-active repeaters are not well constrained, but most likely fall in the valley region between the two peaks of the waiting time distributions.</description>

      <title>JWST's First View of Tidal Disruption Events: Compact, Accretion-Driven Emission Lines &amp; Strong Silicate Emission in an Infrared-selected Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (MIR) emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) is a powerful probe of the circumnuclear environment around dormant supermassive black holes. This emission arises from the reprocessing of intrinsic emission into thermal MIR emission by circumnuclear dust. While the majority of optical- and X-ray-selected TDEs show only weak dust echoes consistent with primarily unobscured sight lines, there have been growing efforts aimed at finding TDEs in obscured environments using MIR selection methods. In this work, we present the first JWST observations of 4 MIR-selected TDEs with JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). Two of these sources show flares in other wavelength bands (one in optical, one in X-ray), while the other two are MIR-only transients. None of these TDEs showed pre-outburst nuclear activity, but all of the MIRI/MRS observations reveal emission lines associated with highly ionized gas in the nucleus, implying ionization from TDE accretion. Additionally, all four sources show silicate emission features around 10 and 18 $\mu$m that are much stronger than the features seen in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We suggest that the emitting dust is optically thin to its own emission and show that the MIR spectrum is consistent with emission from optically thin dust in the nucleus. All four sources show an excess at short wavelengths ($\lambda &lt; 8\, \mu$m), which could arise from a late-time plateau in the intrinsic flare, akin to what is seen in late-time UV observations of unobscured TDEs, although self-consistent dust modeling is required to fully assess the strength of this late-time plateau.</description>

      <title>Non-orbital particle trapping in binary black holes through dynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an interdisciplinary comparison between binary black hole systems and Radio Frequency (RF) Paul Traps, modeling the gravitational binary system as a rotating saddle near its center. This analogy connects these seemingly unrelated systems through the concept of dynamic stability. The rotating saddle potential is analytically tractable, allowing us to prove the existence of bounded charged particle trajectories under certain conditions. By focusing on stellar-mass black holes with a weak electric charge-a feature consistent with specific astrophysical conditions that leaves the spacetime metric largely unaffected but can influence nearby particle interactions-we can neglect complicating factors such as magnetic fields from large accretion disks of heavier black holes or stellar winds. Our simulation results demonstrate that charged particles can exhibit stable, non-orbital trajectories near the center of a binary system with charged stellar-mass black holes, providing unique three-dimensional trapping primarily through gravity. This system is distinctive in the literature for its non-orbital trapping mechanism. While theoretically intriguing, this trapping relies on specific conditions, including nearly identical black hole masses. These types of non-orbital trapping mechanisms could potentially allow for longer-lived plasma configurations, enhancing our ability to detect electromagnetic signatures from these systems. The significance of this work lies in the novel comparison between a laboratory-scale quantum system and a larger astrophysical one, opening new avenues for exploring parallels between microscopic and cosmic phenomena across fourteen orders of magnitude in distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent report of a period in the active repeating Fast Radio Burster 20201124A and of its spindown rate place bounds on the solid angle of its emission on the basis of energetics. The bound depends on the (unknown) efficiency of conversion of rotational energy to coherent radio emission and implies a lower bound on the Lorentz factor of the radiating charges. Bursts may be emitted along the magnetic dipole axis, in repeaters aligned with the rotational axis and the line of sight but misaligned in apparent non-repeaters. This may explain the difficulty of finding periodicity in repeaters and the low duty cycle of apparent non-repeaters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in sub-solar mass black holes due to their potential to provide valuable information about cosmology or the black hole population. Motivated by this, we study observable phenomena connected to the merger of a sub-solar mass black hole with a neutron star. For this purpose, we perform new numerical-relativity simulations of a binary system composed of a black hole with mass $0.5M_\odot$ and a neutron star with mass $1.4 M_\odot$. We investigate the merger dynamics of this exotic system and provide information about the connected gravitational-wave and kilonova signals. Our study indicates that current gravitational-waveform models cannot adequately describe such systems and that phenomenological relations connecting the binary parameters with the ejecta and remnant properties do not apply to our system. Furthermore, we find a dependence of the kilonova signal on the azimuthal viewing angle due to the asymmetric mass ejection. This first-of-its-kind simulation opens the door for studying sub-solar mass black hole - neutron star mergers and could serve as a testing ground for future model development.</description>

Abstract: A magnetically levitated mass couples to gravity and can act as an effective gravitational wave detector. We show that a superconducting sphere levitated in a quadrupolar magnetic field, when excited by a gravitational wave, will produce magnetic field fluctuations that can be read out using a flux tunable microwave resonator. With a readout operating at the standard quantum limit, such a system could achieve broadband strain noise sensitivity of $h \lesssim 10^{-20}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for frequencies of $1~\mathrm{kHz}~-~1~\mathrm{MHz}$, opening new corridors for astrophysical probes of new physics.</description>

Abstract: Axion Like Particles (ALPs) can be produced in Gamma Ray Bursts, altering the polarization of the electromagnetic emission in these events. For the first time, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization measurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes parameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within astrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated parameter space of ALP dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Spikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to gravitational wave emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 20 within a 4 yr observation run, if all dark matter is made up of $\sim30{\rm\,M}_\odot$ PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <title>Charged black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the curvature scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). To construct our solutions, we adopt a linear functional form, $f(R,T) = R + \beta T$. In the limit $\beta = 0$, the theory reduces to General Relativity (GR), recovering $f(R,T) \approx R$. We propose a power-law Lagrangian of the form $\mathcal{L} = f_0 + F + \alpha F^p$, where $\alpha =f_0= 0$ corresponds to the linear electrodynamics case. Using this setup, we derive the metric functions and determine an effective cosmological constant. Our analysis focuses on specific cases with $p = 2$, $p = 4$, and $p = 6$, where we formulate analytic expressions for the matter fields supporting these solutions in terms of the Lagrangian as a function of $F$. Additionally, we verify the regularity of the solutions and study the structure of the event horizons. Furthermore, we examine a more specific scenario by determining the free forms of the first and second derivatives $\mathcal{L}_F(r)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{FF}(r)$ of the Lagrangean of the nonlinear electromagnetic field. From these relations, we derive the general form of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLED}}(r)$ using consistency relations. This Lagrangian exhibits an intrinsic nonlinearity due to the influence of two constants, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Specifically, $\alpha$ originates from the power-law term in the proposed Lagrangian, while $\beta$ arises from the assumed linear function $f(R,T)$. The interplay of these constants ensures that the nonlinearity of the Lagrangian is governed by both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, rather than $\alpha$ alone.</description>

      <title>Supernova constraints on lepton flavor violating ALPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernovae offer a unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We investigate supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to electrons and muons. Three production channels are considered: muon decay, axion bremsstrahlung, and electron-muon coalescence. We find that the electron-muon coalescence process, which was neglected in previous LFV-ALP studies, yields the strongest constraints on the LFV coupling in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>How black hole mimickers and Shapiro-free lenses signal effective dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of two exotic compact objects in the leading relativistic model of modified Newtonian dynamics, namely aether-scalar-tensor theory. This model is consistent with precision cosmology and gravitational wave constraints on tensor speed. Black hole mimickers could subtly change observations: gravitational waves from their mergers might show unusual echoes or altered ringdown patterns, and images of their horizon-scale shadows might be slightly different from those of a true black hole. Shapiro-free lenses are massless objects that deflect light without any gravitational time delay, producing distinctive lensing events. These predictions connect to ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches, horizon-scale imaging, and time-domain lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of the Landau Parameter $G'_0$ from Joint Gamow-Teller Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau-Migdal parameter $G'_0$ characterizes the main part of the spin-isospin nucleon-nucleon interaction. Consequently, the $G'_0$ is closely related to the Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR), the beta and double-beta decay rates of finite nuclei, the spin response of hot and dense nucleonic matter that determines the neutrino-nucleon reaction rates in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, and finally the critical density for pion condensation in neutron stars. Historically, the $G'_0$ was obtained by fitting the peak location of experimental GTR spectra by using phenomenological pion exchange models, without strict uncertainty quantification. In this letter, for the first time, we report the Bayesian inference of $G'_0$ by using a self-consistent Skyrme Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) model and joint constraints from experimental GTR measurements on $^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$, $^{132}\mathrm{Sn}$, $^{90}\mathrm{Zr}$. Our extracted $G_0'$ is $0.48\pm0.034$, which is close to the prediction of a few existing Skyrme models that consider the spin-isospin observables but is smaller than the extracted ones from pion-exchange models. We hint to possible reasons for this deviation, like the value of the nucleon effective mass $\frac{m^*}{m}$. Finally, we demonstrate the influence of $G'_0$ on neutrino opacities in CCSNe and BNS mergers. The new Skyrme parameterizations from our Bayesian study may also be used to study other spin-isospin-dependent phenomena.</description>
