      <title>A Tale of Two Black Holes: Multiband Gravitational-Wave Measurement of Recoil Kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear dynamics of General Relativity leave their imprint on remnants of black hole mergers in the form of a recoil ``kick''. The kick has profound astrophysical implications across the black hole mass range from stellar to super-massive. However, a robust measurement of the kick for generic binaries from gravitational-wave observations has proved so far to be extremely challenging. In this \emph{letter}, we demonstrate the prospects of measuring black hole kicks through a multiband gravitational-wave network consisting of space mission LISA, the current earth-based detector network and a third-generation detector. For two distinct cases of remnant black hole kick (68 km/s, 1006 km/s) emerging from near identical pre-merger configuration of GW190521 -- the first confirmed intermediate-mass black hole -- we find that the multiband network will recover with 90\% credible level the projection of the kick vector relative to the orbital plane within tens of km/s accuracy. Such precise measurement of the kick offer a new set of multi-messenger follow-ups and unprecedented tests of astrophysical formation channels.</description>

      <title>Using shadow of black hole to examine the energy exchange between axion matter and rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that a \textit{slowly} rotating axion-modified black hole resulting from the backreaction of an axion field on a rotating Kerr black hole can have a \textit{D-shaped} shadow as that for a \textit{highly} counter-rotating Kerr black hole. This attributes to the fact that the energy exchange between the axion matter and the black hole influences the rotation of the black hole, so the black hole angular momentum first decreases to zero and then the BH starts to rotate to the opposite direction. Further increasing the coupling leads to a \textit{``human-face-like" shaped} shadows and new lensings due to the chaotic scattering, which are novel and drastically different from Kerr black hole. Our analysis provides the first counterexample to that slowly rotating black hole has nearly circular shadow.</description>

      <title>Relations between Newtonian and relativistic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start with the cosmic Friedmann equations, where we adopt a novel perspective rooted in a Lagrangian formulation grounded in Newtonian mechanics and the first law of thermodynamics. Our investigation operates under the assumption that the universe is populated by either a perfect fluid or a scalar field. By elucidating the intricate interplay between the Lagrangian formulation and the cosmic Friedmann equations, we uncover the fundamental principles governing the universe's dynamics within the framework of these elemental constituents.
  In our concluding endeavor, we embark on the task of harmonizing the classical equations - namely, the conservation, Euler, and Poisson equations - with the principles of General Relativity. This undertaking seeks to extend these foundational equations to encompass the gravitational effects delineated by General Relativity, thus providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the behavior of matter and spacetime in the cosmic context.</description>

      <title>Close Encounter of Three Black Holes III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the three black hole scenario with numerical relativity techniques to study hierarchical configurations where the inner binary contains highly spinning black holes. We find that the merger time of the binary gets a delay (with a number of orbits to merger increase), depending strongly with the distance to the orbiting third hole $D$ as $\sim1/D^{1.6\pm0.1}$. Notably, a different dependence from what we had found in the nonspinning case, $\sim1/D^{2.5}$. We interpret this effect as mostly due to a spin-orbit coupling between the third hole and the closest member of the binary in the successive approaches. This lead us next to study scattering configurations of the third hole with the binary in order to evaluate the extent of this ``sudden'' interactions, finding also a correlation of the delay in merger times with the closest distance, even for the nonspinning cases. We then explore the mass ratio dependence of the triple system by modeling binaries orbiting a larger black hole bearing masses ratios 8:1:1 and 18:1:1 in co-orbiting or counter-orbiting configurations, finding merger times increasing with increasing mass ratios and for the counter-orbiting cases.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-commutative geometry on black hole properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the signatures of a non-commutative black hole solution. Initially, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system, including entropy, heat capacity, and Hawking radiation. For the latter quantity, we employ two distinct methods: surface gravity and the topological approach. Additionally, we examine the emission rate and remnant mass within this context. Remarkably, the lifetime of the black hole, after reaching its final state due to the evaporation process, is expressed analytically up to a grey-body factor. We estimate the lifetime for specific initial and final mass configurations. Also, we analyze the tensorial quasinormal modes using the 6th-order WKB method. Finally, we study the deflection angle, i.e., gravitational lensing, in both the weak and strong deflection limits.</description>

      <title>A monolithic first--order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein--Euler equations and its solution with path-conservative finite difference CWENO schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new, monolithic first--order (both in time and space) BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The entire system of hyperbolic PDEs is solved in a completely unified manner via one single numerical scheme applied to both the conservative sector of the matter part and to the first--order strictly non--conservative sector of the spacetime evolution. The coupling between matter and space-time is achieved via algebraic source terms. The numerical scheme used for the solution of the new monolithic first order formulation is a path-conservative central WENO (CWENO) finite difference scheme, with suitable insertions to account for the presence of the non--conservative terms. By solving several crucial tests of numerical general relativity, including a stable neutron star, Riemann problems in relativistic matter with shock waves and the stable long-time evolution of single and binary puncture black holes up and beyond the binary merger, we show that our new CWENO scheme, introduced two decades ago for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, can be successfully applied also to numerical general relativity, solving all equations at the same time with one single numerical method. In the future the new monolithic approach proposed in this paper may become an attractive alternative to traditional methods that couple central finite difference schemes with Kreiss-Oliger dissipation for the space-time part with totally different TVD schemes for the matter evolution and which are currently the state of the art in the field.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy extraction from an electrostatic black hole by the decay or splitting of electrically charged particles is analyzed. We determine the energetic conditions that make the extraction process viable and present a general expression for the efficiency in terms of the parameters of the electrostatic black hole and the decaying particles. We also examine the conditions that optimize the efficiency of the extraction process. We analyze two particular cases, the first one is the extraction process from a Reissner Nordstr\"om black hole, for charged test particles with nonvanishing angular momentum; the second one and more interesting corresponds to the energy extraction from a Reissner Nordstr\"om de Sitter black hole. For the latter there are two regions where the energy extraction is possible, the generalized ergosphere and a cosmological ergosphere induced by the cosmological horizon. Under certain conditions the two ergospheres get connected and cover the whole region between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon, and therefore the energy extraction is possible at any point in the vicinity of the black hole. Moreover, the efficiency of the energy extraction can be the same for different break up points and also there is the possibility of a different efficiency for the same break up point. The conditions that maximize the efficiency are determined as well.</description>

      <title>Projected gravitational wave constraints on primordial black hole abundance for extended mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the projected minimum constraints set by next-generation gravitational wave detectors Einstein Telescope and LISA on the abundance of primordial black holes relative to dark matter for extended primordial black hole mass distributions. We consider broad power law distributions for a range of negative and positive exponents $\gamma$ and use the IMRPhenomXAS waveforms to simulate binary sources up to mass ratios $q = 1000$ and redshifts $z=300$. Our results show that power law mass distributions loosen the $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ constraint for increasing power law exponents, suggesting that extended distributions do not help in evading existing constraints. Interestingly, very negative values of $\gamma$ yield constraints close to ones derived from a monochromatic distribution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational attraction of ultra-relativistic matter: A new testbed for modified gravity at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the scalar-tensor modification of the gravitational field of an ultrarelativistic particle beam and its effect on a test particle that is used as sensor. To do so, we solve the linearized scalar-tensor gravity field equations sourced by an energy-momentum tensor of a moving point particle. The geodesic equation and the geodesic deviation equation then predict the acceleration of the test particle as well as the momentum transfer due to a passing source. Comparing the momentum transfer predicted by general relativity and scalar tensor gravity, we find that there exists a relevant parameter regime where this difference increases significantly with the velocity of the source particle. Since ultrarelativistic particles are available at accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, ultra-precise acceleration sensors in the vicinity of the particle beam could potentially detect deviations from general relativity or constrain modified gravity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the characteristics of a gravastar in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity, which is upheld by Krori-Barua (KB) metric. We have used Krori-Barua (KB) metric for the interior and shell regions of the gravastar. We deduced our field equations by using Krori-Barua metric. In the outside regions of the gravastar, we have taken two regular black hole metrics. Additionally, we have applied the Israel junction condition to calculate the potential difference across the thin shell concerning different types of regular black holes, such as Bardeen and Hayward. We have also discussed the physical properties like proper length, entropy, energy, EoS and stability.</description>

      <title>Rastall gravity: accretion disk image in radiation fields context and visual transformations compared to Reissner-Nordstrom black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study investigates the astronomical implications of Rastall gravity, particularly its behavior amidst a radiation field compared to Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black holes. Our research delineates a crucial correlation between the dynamics of the accretion disk and the parameters Q and N_{\rm r}, which aptly reflect the influence of spacetime metrics on the disk's appearance. Elevated electric charge Q prompts contraction in the disk's orbit due to enhanced gravitational effects, while higher N_{\rm r} values lead to outward expansion, influenced by the radiation field's attributes. Interestingly, the charged black holes surrounded by radiation fields display distinct visual disparities from RN black holes. Brightness decreases and expansion occurs within the accretion disk's innermost stable circular orbit with rising N_{\rm r} values. Our study also reveals the process by which the accretion disk transitions from a conventional disk-like structure to a hat-like form at different observation angles, with the redshift effect gradually intensifying. Moreover, the results of the Rastall gravity radiation field we consider are consistent with the constraints of the host galaxy's gravitational lensing on the Rastall gravity parameters, enhancing the consistency between theoretical predictions and actual observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analytically study the superradiant stability of Schwarzschild-f(R) black holes under charged massive scalar perturbation. Using an analytic method based on Descartes' rule of signs, we extend previous methods developed for higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black holes to the Schwarzschild-f(R) black hole cases. Our results show that Schwarzschild-f(R) black holes are superradiantly stable under charged massive scalar perturbation, implying the absence of the black hole bomb effect.</description>

      <title>Sourced metric perturbations of Kerr spacetime in Lorenz gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formalism for solving the Lorenz gauge equations for metric perturbations of Kerr spacetime sourced by an arbitrary stress-energy tensor. The metric perturbation is obtained as a sum of differential operators acting on a set of six scalars, with two of spin-weight $\pm2$, two of spin-weight $\pm1$, and two of spin-weight $0$. We derive the sourced Teukolsky equations satisfied by these scalars, with the sources given in terms of differential operators acting on the stress-energy tensor. The method can be used to obtain both linear and higher order nonlinear metric perturbations, and it fully determines the metric perturbation up to a time integral, omitting only static contributions which must be handled separately.</description>

      <title>Conformal Killing gravity in static spherically-symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an anisotropic divergence-free conformal Killing tensor $K_{jl}$ for static spherically symmetric spacetimes, and write the conformal Killing gravity equations as Einstein equations augmented by this tensor. The field equations are of second order: this fact allows for analytic solutions and considerably simplifies the derivation of results of previous studies based on the original Harada equations. In particular, we prove the equivalence of the known third order field equations, with the second order ones obtained by us in the conformal Killing parametrization. The structure of the Ricci tensor and of the conformal Killing tensor are compatible with both anisotropic fluid sources and (non)-linear electrodynamics. We reobtain covariantly and in simple steps the general static spherical solutions for vacuum and linear electrodynamics. Moreover we recover the purely magnetic Lagrangian functions that induce metrics of interest for black holes.</description>

      <title>$F(Q)$ gravity with Gauss-Bonnet corrections: from early-time inflation to late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the $f(Q)$ gravity with a non-metricity scalar $Q$, the curvatures in Einstein's gravity, that is, the Riemann curvature constructed from the standard Levi-Civita connection, could not be excluded or naturally appear. The first observation is that even in $f(Q)$ gravity, the conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor is not described by the covariant derivatives in the non-metricity gravity but that is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The commutator of the covariant derivatives in Einstein's gravity inevitably induces the Riemann curvature. There is no symmetry nor principle which prohibits the Riemann curvature in non-metricity gravity. Based on this observation, we propose and investigate $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal{G}$ and its generalisations. We show how $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ models realising any given the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime can be reconstructed. We apply the reconstruction formalism to cosmology. Explicitly, the gravity models which realise slow roll or constant roll inflation, dark energy epoch as well as the unification of the inflation and dark energy are found. The dynamical autonomous system and the gravitational wave in the theory under investigation are discussed.

      <title>Dark energy with a shift-symmetric scalar field: obstacles, loophole hunting and dead ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a scalar field being the fundamental description of dark energy without the need of self-tuning any parameter. Thereby, we focus on shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories satisfying also that the propagation speed of gravitational waves is equal to the speed of light. Analysing the stability of scalar linear perturbations, we discuss the conditions that seems to be necessary to describe (super) accelerated cosmic expansion without introducing instabilities. It has been established, however, that this stability can be ruined when taking into account the interaction with tensor perturbations (essentially gravitational waves). Indeed, although we shall point out that the standard proof of absence of dark energy stable braiding models due to this interaction has a possible way-out, we find general arguments suggesting that there are no dark energy stable solutions that can exploit this loophole. Thus, we discuss future research directions for finding viable fundamental descriptions of dark energy. We also provide a dictionary between the covariant version of the scalar field theory and that of the Effective Field Theory approach, explicitly computing the parameters in the latter formalism in terms of the functions appearing in the covariant version, and its derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these expressions are explicitly obtained up-to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Viscous Unified Dark Matter Models Under Scrutiny: Uncovering Inconsistencies from Dynamical System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscous unified dark matter models aim to describe the dark sector of the Universe, as the dark matter fluid itself gives rise to an accelerated expansion due to a negative bulk viscous pressure. However, in most studies, radiation is often disregarded as a minor factor in dynamical system analyses, overlooking whether radiation domination is achievable. In this paper, we rigorously examine this critical aspect for common parameterizations of bulk viscosity, denoted as $\xi$, within two general classes of viscous unified models. Our findings reveal significant inconsistencies in models where $\xi \propto H^{1-2s} \rho_{m}^{s}$ with $s\leq 0$, and surprisingly, in models where $\xi \propto \rho_{m}^{s}$ with exponents $s&lt;0$, as they both fail to produce a radiation-dominated era. Moreover, the exponent $s$ must lye within the interval $0 \leq s &lt; 1/2$ for the latter model to correctly describes the cosmological evolution. These results underscore the need of including these constraints as a prior in statistical analyses of observational data, with implications for current statistical inferences for the second model, where both prior and best-fit values of $s$ often fall outside the acceptable range.</description>

      <title>Extracting overlapping gravitational-wave signals of galactic compact binaries: a mini review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have provided a novel tool to explore the universe. In the near future, space-borne detectors will further open the window of low-frequency GW band where abundant sources exist and invaluable information for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics can be revealed. However, there are various new challenges in data analyses for space-borne detectors coming with the abundance of GW signals. For example, there are galactic compact binaries (GCBs) with an overwhelming number that can produce continuous GW signals existing the entire mission time of detectors. The enormous overlapping GCB signals tangle and correlate with each other, and blend with other types of sources together in the observed data. Extracting source information from overlapping signals is one of the key problems for data analyses of space-borne detectors. In the paper, we present a review of currently available solutions for extracting overlapping GCB signals as thoroughly as possible aiming at promoting more interest in this question and inspiring further improvements. Current solutions can be roughly categorized by two classes, iterative subtraction and global fitting. There are diverse implementations of both strategies with enhancements focusing on different aspects. Meanwhile, the hybrid approach and the machine learning technique are also used in recent years. In the last, we also present an introduction of the stochastic foreground formed by unresolvable faint GCBs about its separation from extra-galactic backgrounds and its utility in exploring the properties of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Trifecta of Modelling Tools: Navigating COMPAS, Shark and Bayesian Inference for Binary Black Hole Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have revealed surprising properties of binary black hole (BBH) populations, but there is still mystery surrounding how these compact objects evolve. We apply Bayesian inference and an efficient method to calculate the BBH merger rates in the Shark host galaxies, to determine the combination of COMPAS parameters that outputs a population most like the GW sources from the LVK transient catalogue. For our COMPAS models, we calculate the likelihood with and without the dependence on the predicted number of BBH merger events. We find strong correlations between hyper-parameters governing the specific angular momentum (AM) of mass lost during mass transfer, the mass-loss rates of Wolf--Rayet stars via winds and the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) formation channel. We conclude that analysing the marginalised and unmarginalised likelihood is a good indicator of whether the population parameters distribution and number of observed events reflect the LVK data. In doing so, we see that the majority of the models preferred in terms of the population-level parameters of the BBHs greatly overpredict the number of events we should have observed to date. Looking at the smaller number of models which perform well with both likelihoods, we find that those with no CHE, AM loss occurring closer to the donor during the first mass-transfer event, and/or higher rates of mass-loss from Wolf--Rayet winds are generally preferred by current data. We find these conclusions to be robust to our choice of selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Suppression of Cosmic Rays' Flux in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Spectral Characterization of the Gravitational-wave Background with the PTA Optimal Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have made tremendous progress and are now showing strong evidence for the gravitational-wave background (GWB). Further probing the origin and characteristics of the GWB will require more generalized analysis techniques. Bayesian methods are most often used but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, frequentist methods, like the PTA Optimal Statistic (OS), are more computationally efficient and can produce results that are complementary to Bayesian methods, allowing for stronger statistical cases to be built from a confluence of different approaches. In this work we expand the capabilities of the OS through a technique we call the Per-Frequency Optimal Statistic (PFOS). The PFOS removes the underlying power-law assumption inherent in previous implementations of the OS, and allows one to estimate the GWB spectrum in a frequency-by-frequency manner. We have also adapted a recent generalization from the OS pipeline into the PFOS, making it capable of accurately characterizing the spectrum in the intermediate and strong GW signal regimes using only a small fraction of the necessary computational resources when compared with fully-correlated Bayesian methods, while also empowering many new types of analyses not possible before. We find that even in the strong GW signal regime, where the GWB dominates over noise in all frequencies, the injected value of the signal lies within the 50th-percentile of the PFOS uncertainty distribution in 41-45% of simulations, remaining 3$\sigma$-consistent with unbiased estimation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the minimal Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity in combination with the Standard Model of particle physics contains just one extra scalar degree of freedom (in addition to the graviton and the Standard Model fields) with the properties of an axion-like particle which can solve the strong CP-problem. The smallness of this particle's mass as well as of the cosmological constant is ensured by tiny values of the gauge coupling constants of the local Lorentz group. The tree value of the Higgs boson mass and that of Majorana leptons (if added to the Standard Model to solve the neutrino mass, baryogenesis and dark matter problems) are very small or vanishing, opening the possibility of their computability in terms of the fundamental parameters of the theory due to nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Be careful in multi-messenger inference of the Hubble constant: A path forward for robust inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) are a direct probe of the expansion history of the universe and carry the potential to shed light on the disparity between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. To measure the value of $H_0$ with such observations requires pristine inference of the luminosity distance and the true source redshift with minimal impact from systematics. In this analysis, we carry out joint inference on mock gravitational wave (GW) signals and their electromagnetic (EM) afterglows from BNS coalescences and find that the inclination angle inferred from the afterglow light curve and apparent superluminal motion can be precise, but need not be accurate and is subject to systematic uncertainty that could be as large as $1.5\sigma$. This produces a disparity between the EM and GW inferred inclination angles, which if not carefully treated when combining observations can bias the inferred value of $H_0$. We also find that already small misalignments of $3^{\circ}-6^{\circ}$ between the inherent system inclinations for the GW and EM emission can bias the inference by $\mathcal{O}(1-2\sigma)$ if not taken into account. As multi-messenger BNS observations are rare, we must make the most out of a small number of events and harness the increased precision, while avoiding reduced accuracy. We demonstrate how to mitigate these potential sources of bias by jointly inferring the mismatch between the GW- and EM-based inclination angles and $H_0$.</description>

  This builds connection between results for trapped sets with low regularity in hyperbolic dynamic systems conditioning on negativity of the topological pressure and unconditional results in the setting of normally hyperbolic trapping.</description>

Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended inert doublet model and obtained the parameter space allowing strong first order phase transitions. We show that a large part of the parameter space can cause double first-order phase transitions. Whereas both of these phase transitions can generate a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, one of them can create primordial black holes with appreciable abundance. The primordial black holes generated at the high scale transition can account for the dark matter maintaining the correct relic abundance. We also show specific benchmark cases and their consequences from the aspect of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by a large $N$ non-commutative coordinates is proposed as a theory for quantum gravity [1]. In this paper, we construct Kerr black hole as a rotating noncommutative geometry solution of this theory. Due to rotation, the fuzzy sphere is deformed into a fuzzy ellipsoid, which matches exactly the outer horizon of the Kerr black hole in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Together with a half-filled Fermi sea, the fuzzy solution reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as well as the mass of the Kerr black hole. These results provide further support that the proposed theory of quantum spaces is a plausible candidate for the theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging neural networks, we address the inverse problem of constructing a quantitative 2+1-flavor holographic QCD model based on state-of-the-art lattice QCD data. Our model demonstrates quantitative agreement with the latest lattice QCD results. We construct the full phase diagram at finite magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ and temperature $T$. We uncover rich phase structure with a first-order phase transition surface and a critical endpoint line within the 3-dimensional phase diagram. The critical endpoint at vanishing chemical potential aligns with current speculations in the lattice QCD literature. In particular, for large magnetic field, we find two critical endpoints in the $T$-$\mu_B$ plane. The critical exponents of the critical endpoints adhere to scaling relations and depend on the background magnetic field. Moreover, they are exhibit deviations from mean-field theory, highlighting the distinctive features of our holographic approach.</description>

      <title>Every Poincar\'e gauge theory is conformal: a compelling case for dynamical vector torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the no black hole theorem in three dimensional (3D) gravity in the Newman-Penrose formalism in a generalized Newman-Unti gauge. After adapting the well established 4D NP formalism and its gauge and coordinates system to 3D gravity, we show that the no black hole theorem is manifest in the NP equations. We further study in detail the horizon properties of the 3D charged rotating solutions and confirm that a black hole solution requires a negative cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: Regular black hole metrics involve a universal, mass-independent regulator that can be up to O(700) km while remaining consistent with terrestrial tests of Newtonian gravity and astrophysical tests of general relativistic orbits. However, for such large values of the regulator scale, the metric describes a compact, astrophysical-mass object with no horizon rather than a black hole. We note that allowing the regulator to have a nontrivial mass dependence preserves the horizon, while allowing large, percent-level effects in black hole observables. By considering the deflection angle of light and the black hole shadow, we demonstrate this possibility explicitly.</description>

Abstract: We extend the concept of the Kodama symmetry, a quasi-local time translation symmetry for dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes, to a specific class of dynamical axisymmetric spacetimes, namely the families of Kerr-Vaidya and Kerr-Vaidya-de Sitter spacetimes. We study some geometrical properties of the asymptotically flat Kerr-Vaidya metric, such as the Brown-York mass and the Einstein tensor. Furthermore, we propose a generalization of the Kerr-Vaidya metric to an asymptotic de Sitter background. We show that for these classes of dynamical axisymmetric black hole spacetimes, there exists a timelike vector field that exhibits similar properties to the Kodama vector field in spherical symmetry. This includes the construction of a covariantly conserved current and a corresponding locally conserved charge, which in the Kerr-Vaidya case converges to the Brown-York mass in the asymptotically flat region.</description>

Abstract: Rotating fermion-boson stars are hypothetical celestial objects that consist of both fermionic and bosonic matter interacting exclusively through gravity. Bosonic fields are believed to arise in certain models of particle physics describing dark matter and could accumulate within neutron stars, modifying some of their properties and gravitational wave emission. Fermion-boson stars have been extensively studied in the static non-rotating case, exploring their combined stability and their gravitational radiation in binary mergers. However, stationary rotating configurations were yet to be found and investigated. The presence of a bosonic component could impact the development of the bar-mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars. Therefore, the study of rotating fermion-boson stars has important implications for astrophysics, as they could provide a new avenue for the detection of gravitational waves. In addition, these objects may shed light on the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the cores of neutron stars, and explain any tension in the determination of the dense-matter equation of state from multi-messenger observations. In this work we study a new consistent method of constructing uniformly rotating fermion-boson stars and we analyse some of their main properties. These objects might offer alternative explanations for current observations populating the lower black-hole mass gap, as the $2.6 M_\odot$ compact object involved in GW190814.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of instrument noise and astrophysical fluctuations on measurements of the first black hole photon ring</title>

Abstract: Currently envisioned extensions of the Event Horizon Telescope to space will soon target the black hole photon ring: a narrow ring-shaped imprint of a black hole's strong gravity produced in its images by highly bent photon trajectories. In principle, the shape of the photon ring encodes information about the geometry of the underlying black hole spacetime. In practice, however, whether or not this information can be extracted from the ring shape depends on several factors, ranging from the astrophysical details of the emitting source (such as the magnitude of its plasma fluctuations) to the specific configuration of the interferometric array (such as the separation between its telescopes, or the level of noise in its instruments). Here, we employ a phenomenological model to assess the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and instrument noise on the inferred shape of the photon ring. Our systematic study of several astrophysical profiles suggests that this shape can be measured even in the presence of instrument noise across a wide range of baselines. The measurement accuracy and precision appear relatively insensitive to the noise level, up to a sharp threshold beyond which any measurement becomes incredibly challenging (at least without recourse to more sophisticated data analysis methods). Encouragingly, we find that only a few snapshot images are generally needed to overcome the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and correctly infer the ring diameter. Inference becomes more challenging when analyzing the visibility amplitude in a baseline window that is not entirely dominated by a single photon ring. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is still possible to fit a ring shape with the correct fractional asymmetry. These results provide excellent prospects for future precision measurements of black hole spin and fundamental astrophysics via black hole imaging.</description>

      <title>Horizon-penetrating form of parametrized metrics for static and stationary black holes</title>

Abstract: The Rezzolla-Zhidenko (RZ) and Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) frameworks provide an efficient approach to characterize agnostically spherically symmetric or stationary black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories. In their original construction, these metrics were defined only in the spacetime region outside of the event horizon, where they can reproduce any black-hole metric with percent precision and a few parameters only. At the same time, numerical simulations of accreting black holes often require metric functions that are regular across the horizon, so that the inner boundary of the computational domain can be placed in a region that is causally disconnected from the exterior. We present a novel formulation of the RZ/KRZ parametrized metrics in coordinate systems that are regular at the horizon and defined everywhere in the interior. We compare the horizon-penetrating form of the KRZ and RZ metrics with the corresponding forms of the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild coordinates and of the Schwarzschild metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, remarking the similarities and differences. We expect the horizon-penetrating formulations of the RZ/KRZ metrics to represent new tools to study via simulations the physical processes that occur near the horizon of an arbitrary black hole.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>

Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance could be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with the null stream from Sagnac configuration. The combined data streams, two science observables from the hybrid Relay and a null observable from the Sagnac, could form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>ExaGRyPE: Numerical General Relativity Solvers Based upon the Hyperbolic PDEs Solver Engine ExaHyPE</title>

Abstract: ExaGRyPE describes a suite of solvers for numerical relativity, based upon ExaHyPE 2, the second generation of our Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine. The presented generation of ExaGRyPE solves the Einstein equations in the CCZ4 formulation under a 3+1 foliation and focuses on black hole spacetimes. It employs a block-structured Cartesian grid carrying a higher-order order Finite Difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement, it facilitates massive parallelism combining message passing, domain decomposition and task parallelism, and it supports the injection of particles into the grid as data probes or tracers. We introduce the ExaGRyPE-specific building blocks within ExaHyPE 2, and discuss its software architecture and compute-n-feel:
  For this, we formalize the creation of any specific simulation with ExaGRyPE as a sequence of lowering operations, where abstract logical tasks are successively broken into finer tasks until we obtain an abstraction level that can be mapped onto a C++ executable. The overall program logic is fully specified via a domain-specific Python interface, we map this logic onto a more detailed set of numerical tasks, subsequently lower this representation onto technical tasks that the underlying ExaHyPE engine uses to parallelize the application, before eventually the technical tasks are mapped onto task graphs including the actual PDE term evaluations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and so forth. We end up with a rigorous separation of concerns which shields ExaGRyPE users from technical details and hence simplifies the development of novel physical models. We present the simulations and data for the gauge wave, static single black holes and rotating binary black hole systems, demonstrating that the code base is mature and usable. However, we also uncover domain-specific numerical challenges that need further study by the community in future work.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Detection of Unmodelled Gravitational-Wave Transients Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14611v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated potential for the real-time analysis of data from gravitational-wave detector networks for the specific case of signals from coalescing compact-object binaries such as black-hole binaries. Unfortunately, training these CNNs requires a precise model of the target signal; they are therefore not applicable to a wide class of potential gravitational-wave sources, such as core-collapse supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts, where unknown physics or computational limitations prevent the development of comprehensive signal models. We demonstrate for the first time a CNN with the ability to detect generic signals -- those without a precise model -- with sensitivity across a wide parameter space. Our CNN has a novel structure that uses not only the network strain data but also the Pearson cross-correlation between detectors to distinguish correlated gravitational-wave signals from uncorrelated noise transients. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CNN using data from the second LIGO-Virgo observing run, and show that it has sensitivity comparable to that of the "gold-standard" transient searches currently used by LIGO-Virgo, at extremely low (order of 1 second) latency and using only a fraction of the computing power required by existing searches, allowing our models the possibility of true real-time detection of gravitational-wave transients associated with gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, and other relativistic astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Rapidly growing primordial black holes as seeds of the massive high-redshift JWST Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\gtrsim 7$ have been recently detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form so early within the framework of standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work, we propose that this puzzle can be explained by the presence of some primordial black holes (PBHs) with a mass of $\sim 1000 M_\odot$. These PBHs, clothed in dark matter halo and undergoing super-Eddington accretion, serve as seeds for the early galaxy formation with masses of $\sim 10^{8}-10^{10}~M_\odot$ at high redshift, thus accounting for the JWST observations. Using a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to constrain the PBH mass distribution models, we find that the Lognormal model with $M_{\rm c}\sim 750M_\odot$ is preferred over other hypotheses. These rapidly growing BHs are expected to emit strong radiation and may appear as high-redshift compact objects, similar to those recently discovered by JWST. Although we focuse on PBHs in this work, the bound on the initial mass of the seed black holes remains robust even if they were formed through astrophysical channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scar states are special finite-energy density, but non-thermal states of chaotic Hamiltonians. We argue that all holographic quantum field theories, including $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang--Mills, have scar states. Their presence is tied to the existence of non-topological, horizonless soliton solutions in gravity: oscillons and a novel family of excited boson stars. We demonstrate that these solutions have periodic oscillations in the correlation functions and posses low-entanglement entropy as expected for scar states. Also we find that they can be very easily prepared with Euclidean path integral.</description>

      <title>Neural ODEs for holographic transport models without translation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the data-driven holographic transport models without translation symmetry. Our data are the real part of the frequency-dependent shear viscosity, denoted as $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$. We develop a radial flow equation of the shear response and establish its relation to $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ for a wide class of holographic models. This allows us to determine $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ of a strongly coupled field theory by the black hole metric and the graviton mass. The latter serves as the bulk dual to the translation symmetry breaking on the boundary. We convert the flow equation to a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), which is a neural network with continuous depth and produces output through a black-box ODE solver. We test the Neural ODE in three well-known holographic models without translation symmetry. Given either the metric or the mass, we display that the Neural ODE can learn the other with high accuracy. We also illustrate that the learned metric can be used to predict the derivative of entanglement entropy $S$ with respect to the size of entangling region $l$, which suggests an intriguing relationship between $S^{\prime }(l)$ and $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$.</description>

      <title>Consistent eccentricities for gravitational wave astronomy: Resolving discrepancies between astrophysical simulations and waveform models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting imprints of orbital eccentricity in GW signals promises to shed light on the formation mechanisms of binary black holes. To constrain formation mechanisms, distributions of eccentricity derived from numerical simulations of astrophysical formation channels are compared to the estimates of eccentricity inferred from GW signals. We report that the definition of eccentricity typically used in astrophysical simulations is inconsistent with the one used while modeling GW signals, with the differences mainly arising due to the choice of reference frequency used in both cases. We also posit a prescription for calculating eccentricity from astrophysical simulations by evolving ordinary differential equations obtained from post-Newtonian theory, and using the dominant ($\ell = m =2$) mode's frequency as the reference frequency; this ensures consistency in the definitions. On comparing the existing eccentricities of binaries present in the Cluster Monte Carlo catalog of globular cluster simulations with the eccentricities calculated using the prescription presented here, we find a significant discrepancy at $e \gtrsim 0.2$; this discrepancy becomes worse with increasing eccentricity. We note the implications this discrepancy has for existing studies, and recommend that care be taken when comparing data-driven constraints on eccentricity to expectations from astrophysical formation channels.</description>

      <title>Spinning Particle Geometries in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spinning particle/defect geometries in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. These solutions lie below the BTZ threshold, and can be obtained from identifications of AdS$_3$. We construct the Feynman propagator by solving the bulk equation of motion in the spinning particle geometry, summing over the modes of the fields and passing to the boundary. The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation. We comment on the casual behavior of bulk geometries associated with single-trace operators of spin scaling with the central charge below the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating PBHs is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function and induced gravitational waves (GWs) with such non-Gaussianities. When the PBH abundance is fixed, non-Gaussianity only has mild impact on the spectral shape of the induced GWs, which gives relatively robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>The quasilocal energy and thermodynamic first law in accelerating AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the conserved energy of an accelerating AdS black hole by employing the off-shell quasilocal formalism, which amalgamates the ADT formalism with the covariant phase space approach. In the presence of conical singularities in the accelerating black hole, the energy expression is articulated through the surface term derived from our formalism. The essence of our analysis of the quasilocal energy resides in the surface contributions coming from the conical singularities as well as the conventional radial boundary. Consequently, the resultant conserved quasilocal energy naturally conforms the thermodynamic first law for the black hole without necessitating any augmentation of thermodynamic variables. Additionally, we obtain the Smarr relation for the black hole using the differential operator method and the scaling argument of the relevant thermodynamic quantities.</description>
