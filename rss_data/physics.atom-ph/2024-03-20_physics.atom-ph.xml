      <title>Electrostatic trapping of N$_2$ molecules in high Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N$_2$ molecules traveling in pulsed supersonic beams have been excited from their ${\mathrm{X\,^1\Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^+}}$ ground electronic state to long-lived Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers between 39 and 48 using a resonance-enhanced two-color three-photon excitation scheme. The Rydberg states populated had static electric dipole moments exceeding $5000$ D which allowed deceleration of the molecules to rest in the laboratory-fixed frame of reference and three-dimensional trapping using inhomogeneous electric fields. The trapped molecules were confined for up to 10 ms, with effective trap decay time constants increasing with principal quantum number, and ranging from 450$\mu$s to 700 $\mu$s. These observations, and comparison with the results of similar measurements with He atoms, indicate that the decay dynamics of the trapped Rydberg N$_2$ molecules are dominated by spontaneous emission and do not exhibit significant contributions from effects of intramolecular interactions that lead to non-radiative decay.</description>

      <title>Optical Atomic Clock Interrogation Via an Integrated Spiral Cavity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks have demonstrated revolutionary advances in precision timekeeping, but their applicability to the real world is critically dependent on whether such clocks can operate outside a laboratory setting. The challenge to clock portability stems from the many obstacles not only in miniaturizing the underlying components of the clock $-$ namely the ultrastable laser, the frequency comb, and the atomic reference itself $-$ but also in making the clock resilient to environmental fluctuations. Photonic integration offers one compelling solution to simultaneously address the problems of miniaturization and ruggedization, but brings with it a new set of challenges in recreating the functionality of an optical clock using chip-scale building blocks. The clock laser used for atom interrogation is one particular point of uncertainty, as the performance of the meticulously-engineered bulk-cavity stabilized lasers would be exceptionally difficult to transfer to chip. Here we demonstrate that a chip-integrated ultrahigh quality factor (Q) spiral cavity, when interfaced with a 1348 nm seed laser, reaches a fractional frequency instability of $7.5 \times 10^{-14}$, meeting the stability requirements for interrogating the narrow-linewidth transition of $^{88}$Sr$^+$ upon frequency doubling to 674 nm. In addition to achieving the record for laser stability on chip, we use this laser to showcase the operation of a Sr-ion clock with short-term instability averaging down as $3.9 \times 10^{-14} / \sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the averaging time. Our demonstration of an optical atomic clock interrogated by an integrated spiral cavity laser opens the door for future advanced clock systems to be entirely constructed using lightweight, portable, and mass-manufacturable integrated optics and electronics.</description>

      <title>Atomic binding corrections for high energy fixed target experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High energy beams incident on a fixed target may scatter against atomic electrons. To a first approximation, one can treat these electrons as at rest. For precision experiments, however, it is important to be able to estimate the size of, and when necessary calculate, sub-leading corrections. We discuss atomic binding corrections to relativistic lepton-electron scattering. We analyze hydrogen in detail, before generalizing our analysis to multi-electron atoms. Using the virial theorem, and many-body sum rules, we find that the corrections can be reduced to measured binding energies, and the expectation value of a single one-body operator. We comment on the phenomenological impact for neutrino flux normalization and an extraction of hadronic vacuum polarization from elastic muon electron scattering at MUonE.</description>

      <title>Shape and size measurements of nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates using image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates have been the subject of intense research in recent years due to their potential applications in quantum computing and many other areas. However, measuring the shape and size of out-of-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates is a challenging task that requires sophisticated image processing techniques. We propose to study perturbed BEC based on general concepts of analysis, which are widely used in the image processing community. The mathematical basis underlying the algorithms is quite general and independent of the type of image studied. The morphological changes observed in the perturbed atomic clouds as a result of excitation amplitude were observed in a consistent manner. And the spatial expansion of the atomic clouds under free fall shows some symmetry, but it was only observed under certain conditions</description>

      <title>Practical ultra-low frequency noise laser system for quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The laser's frequency noise is crucial to the sensitivity of quantum sensors. Two commonly used methods to suppress the laser's frequency noise are locking the laser to an atomic transition by the lock-in technique or to an ultra-low thermal expansion (ULE) glass cavity by the PDH technique. The former cannot suppress rapidly changing frequency noise and hardly meets the needs; the latter has powerful performance but a heightened cost. The lack of high-performance and low-cost laser noise suppression methods dramatically limits the practical application of quantum sensors. This work demonstrates that, in many quantum sensing applications such as the Rydberg atomic superheterodyne receiver, by cascade locking the laser to both the atomic transition and a low-cost (LC) cavity, the same performance as locking to the ULE cavity can be achieved. This work is significant in promoting the practical application of quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Dicke superradiance in ordered arrays of multilevel atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inverted atomic ensembles, photon-mediated interactions give rise to Dicke superradiance, a form of many-body decay that results in a rapid release of energy as a photon burst. While originally studied in pointlike ensembles, this phenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the inter-particle distance is below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in a realistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new opportunities for light-matter interactions as their internal structure allows for trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their long-wavelength transitions, providing the potential for collectively enhanced dissipative interactions. Despite their intricate electronic structure, we show that two-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should exhibit many-body superradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover, superradiance effectively ``closes'' transitions, such that multilevel atoms become more two-level like. This occurs because the avalanchelike decay funnels the emission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming the single-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman branching. Our work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth atoms as quantum optical sources and as platforms to explore many-body dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnonic spin current shot noise in an itinerant Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin transport phenomena at strongly-correlated interfaces play central roles in fundamental physics as well as spintronic applications. To anatomize spin-transport carriers, we propose the detection of the spin current noise in interacting itinerant fermions. The Fano factor given by the ratio between the spin current and its noise reflects elementary carriers of spin transport at the interface of spin-polarized Fermi gases realized in ultracold atoms. The change of the Fano factor microscopically evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to magnon transport in itinerant fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>
