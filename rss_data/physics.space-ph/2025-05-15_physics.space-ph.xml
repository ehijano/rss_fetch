      <title>ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5% of the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Varieties of Three-dimensional Hall-MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out extensive pseudospectral direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of decaying three-dimensional (3D) Hall magnetohydrodynamics (3D HMHD) plasma turbulence at three magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pr_{m}=0.1$, $1.0$ and $10.0$. Our DNSs have been designed to uncover the dependence of the statistical properties of 3D HMHD turbulence on $Pr_m$ and to bring out the subtle interplay between three lengths, the kinetic and magnetic dissipation length scales $\eta_u$, and $\eta_b$ and the ion-inertial scale $d_i$, below which we see the manifestations of the Hall term. This interplay, qualitatively apparent from isosurface plots of the moduli of the vorticity and the current density, is exposed clearly by the kinetic-energy and magnetic-energy spectra, $E_u(k)$ and $E_b(k)$, respectively. We find two different inertial regions, In the first inertial region $k&lt;k_{i}\sim1/d_i$, both the kinetic-energy and magnetic-energy spectra, $E_u(k)$ and $E_b(k)$, respectively, display power-law regions with an exponent that is consistent with Kolmogorov-type $-5/3$ scaling, at all values of $Pr_m$. In the second inertial region $k &gt; k_{i}$, the scaling of $E_b(k)$ depends upon $Pr_M$: At $Pr_{m}=0.1$, the spectral-scaling exponent is $-17/3$, but for $Pr_{m}=1$ and $10$ this exponent is $-11/3$. We then show theoretically that
  $E_u(k) \sim k^2 E_b(k)$ for $Pr_m \ll 1$ and $E_b(k) \sim k^2 E_u(k)$ for $Pr_m \gg 1$; our DNS results are consistent with our theoretical predictions. We examine, furthermore, left- and right-polarised fluctuations of the fields that lead, respectively, to the dominance of ion-cyclotron or whistler waves.</description>

      <title>A Possible Problem with the Sunspot Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunspots are areas of strong magnetic fields driven by a convective dynamo. Rudolf Wolf devised his Sunspot Number (SN) series to describe its variation with time. Most other solar phenomena vary in concert with SN, in particular the microwave radiation. During the interval 2014-Jul to 2015-Dec, the variation of the SN with the microwave flux (e.g. F10.7) was anomalous, although microwave flux did not exhibit any anomaly with respect to the solar magnetic field measured by the HMI instrument on the SDO spacecraft. This points to a possible problem with the derivation of the SN using the 148,714 reports of sunspot observations received by the World Data Center Solar Influences (SIDC/SILSO at ROB) since 2011 (when the last public raw data was released). The unavailability of the raw data since then, contrary to avowed open data policy of ROB, prevents independent assessment and possible correction of the anomaly. We urge ROB to make the raw data available.</description>

      <title>Role of ion acoustic instability in magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a first-principles numerical study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with different initial ion-to-electron temperature ratios. In cases where this ratio is significantly below unity, we observe intense wave activity in the diffusion region, driven by the ion-acoustic instability. Our analysis shows that the dominant macroscopic effect of this instability is to drive substantial ion heating. In contrast to earlier studies reporting significant anomalous resistivity, we find that anomalous contributions due to the ion-acoustic instability are minimal. These results shed light on the dynamical impact of this instability on reconnection processes, offering new insights into the fundamental physics governing collisionless reconnection.</description>

      <title>The high-energy protons of the ground level enhancement (GLE74) event on 11 May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High energy solar protons were observed by particle detectors aboard spacecraft in near-Earth orbit on May 11, 2024 and produced the 74th ground level enhancement (GLE74) event registered by ground-based neutron monitors. This study involves a detailed reconstruction of the neutron monitor response, along with the identification of the solar eruption responsible for the emission of the primary particles, utilizing both in situ and remote-sensing. Observations spanning proton energies from a few MeV to around 1.64 GeV, collected from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A), and neutron monitors, were integrated with records of the associated solar soft X-ray flare, coronal mass ejection, and radio bursts, to identify the solar origin of the GLE74. Additionally, a time-shift analysis was conducted to link the detected particles to their solar sources. Finally, a comparison of GLE74 to previous ones is carried out. GLE74 reached a maximum particle rigidity of at least 2.4 GV and was associated with a series of type III, type II, and type IV radio bursts. The release time of the primary solar energetic particles (SEPs) with an energy of 500 MeV was estimated to be around 01:21 UT. A significant SEP flux was observed from the anti-Sun direction with a relatively broad angular distribution, rather than a narrow, beam-like pattern, particularly during the main phase at the particle peak flux. Comparisons with previous GLEs suggest that GLE74 was a typical event in terms of solar eruption dynamics.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Model of Wavelength-dependent Opposition Surge in Emittance and Reflectance Spectroscopy of Airless Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical frameworks for reflection and emission spectroscopy of exoplanet surfaces are becoming increasingly important for the characterization of rocky exoplanets, especially with the rapid growth of the detected exoplanet population and observational capabilities. The Hapke theory of reflectance and emittance spectroscopy has been widely adopted in the exoplanet community, yet a key physical effect - the opposition surge enhancement at small phase angles - remains largely neglected. This phenomenon, driven by shadow hiding and coherent backscattering, introduces a significant brightening that depends on wavelength, particle size, and surface morphology. In this paper, I propose an alternative formulation for opposition surge modeling, ensuring a smooth-to-sharp transition at small phase angles, dictated by wavelength-dependent scattering properties. I evaluate the impact of opposition surge on phase curves and surface spectra, comparing a family of models with increasing simplifications, ranging from a full wavelength-dependent opposition effect to its complete omission. My results indicate that neglecting opposition effects can introduce systematic deviations in retrieved albedos, spectral features, and phase curves, with errors reaching up to 20%-30% in certain spectral bands. Upcoming JWST observations will probe phase angles below ~10{\deg} for rocky exoplanets around M dwarfs; thus, accounting for opposition effects is crucial for accurate surface characterization. Proper treatment of this effect will lead to improved retrievals of surface albedo, mineralogical composition, and roughness properties. This study establishes a physically consistent framework for exoplanet phase-curve modeling and provides a foundation for future retrieval algorithms aimed at interpreting exoplanet surfaces.</description>
