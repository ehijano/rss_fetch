      <title>Directional Price Forecasting in the Continuous Intraday Market under Consideration of Neighboring Products and Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of variable renewable energy and flexible demand technologies, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, introduces significant uncertainty in power systems, resulting in greater imbalance; defined as the deviation between scheduled and actual supply or demand. Short-term power markets, such as the European continuous intraday market, play a critical role in mitigating these imbalances by enabling traders to adjust forecasts close to real time. Due to the high volatility of the continuous intraday market, traders increasingly rely on electricity price forecasting to guide trading decisions and mitigate price risk. However most electricity price forecasting approaches in the literature simplify the forecasting task. They focus on single benchmark prices, neglecting intra-product price dynamics and price signals from the limit order book. They also underuse high-frequency and cross-product price data.
  In turn, we propose a novel directional electricity price forecasting method for hourly products in the European continuous intraday market. Our method incorporates short-term features from both hourly and quarter-hourly products and is evaluated using German European Power Exchange data from 2024-2025. The results indicate that features derived from the limit order book are the most influential exogenous variables. In addition, features from neighboring products; especially those with delivery start times that overlap with the trading period of the target product; improve forecast accuracy. Finally, our evaluation of the value captured by our electricity price forecasting suggests that the proposed electricity price forecasting method has the potential to generate profit when applied in trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Finance-Grounded Optimization For Algorithmic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss (PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization, a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.</description>
