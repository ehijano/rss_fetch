      <title>On study of cell proliferation and diffusion using nonlinear transforms of heat equation solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell proliferation and diffusion can be modeled through reaction-diffusion systems describing the space-time evolution of a density variable. In this work, we present non-linear transformations of heat equation solutions to model cellular growth and diffusion using a Richards growth function. The solutions are obtained by using two-variable Hermite Polynomials. We estimated the parameters of the Richards function by comparing the model solutions with the experimentally observed data from scratch assays. To check robustness of the parameters estimated, we used a fractional Brownian Motion (fBM) field type noise with given Hurst exponent (H) for minimizing residual errors. We found that the parameters can be robustly estimated and match with previous estimations. Further, we also confirmed that the spatial-temporal patterns of cell density in the experiments can be well described by the solutions developed using the proposed nonlinear transforms method.</description>

      <title>Attractor learning for spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems using echo state networks with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the predictive capabilities of echo state networks (ESNs) for the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation, an archetypal nonlinear PDE that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. We introduce a novel methodology that integrates ESNs with transfer learning, aiming to enhance predictive performance across various parameter regimes of the gKS model. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor.</description>

      <title>Disordering a permutation symmetric system: revivals, thermalization and chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of introducing a symmetry breaking disorder on the dynamics of a system invariant under particle permutation. The disorder forces quantum states, confined to the $N+1$ dimensional completely symmetric space to penetrate the exponentially large $2^N$ dimensional Hilbert space of $N$ particles. In particular, we focus on the quantum kicked top as a Floquet system of $N$ qubits, and use linear entropy, measuring single qubit entanglement, to investigate the changes in the time scales and values of saturation when disorder is introduced. In the near-integrable regime of the kicked top, we study the robustness of quantum revivals to disorder. We also find that a classical calculation yields the quantum single qubit entanglement to remarkable accuracy in the disorder free limit. The disorder, on the other hand, is modeled in the form of noise which again fits well with the numerical calculations. We measure the extent to which the dynamics is retained within the symmetric subspace and its spreading to the full Hilbert space using different quantities. We show that increasing disorder drives the system to a chaotic phase in full Hilbert space, as also supported by the spectral statistics. We find that there is robustness to disorder in the system, and this is a function of how chaotic the kicked top is.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in the Lorenz System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lorenz system, a seminal model in chaos theory, is renowned for its complex dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This work investigates conserved quantities within the standard Lorenz equations. The system exhibits phase space volume contraction, a characteristic of dissipative systems. Despite the common understanding positing the absence of conserved quantities in its typical chaotic parameter regimes, this study demonstrates that the Lorenz system possesses at least three dynamical constants of motion. The implications of these conserved quantities for the system's chaotic behavior are discussed.</description>
