      <title>On prime ends equicontinuity of unclosed inverse mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mappings satisfying the inverse Poletsky-type inequality in a domain of Euclidean space. Such inequalities are well known and play an important role in the study of quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings. We consider the case when the mapped domain, generally speaking, is not locally connected on its boundary. At the same time, we consider the situation when the mapping is open and discrete, but may not preserve the boundary of the domain. In terms of prime ends, we obtain results on the equicontinuity of families of such mappings in the closure of the definition domain.</description>

      <title>On the location of zeros of a quaternion polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of locating the zeros of polynomials of a quaternionic variable with quaternionic coefficients. We derive some new Cauchy bounds for the zeros of a polynomial by virtue of maximum modulus theorem. Our results will generalise some recently proved results about the distribution of zeros of a quaternionic polynomial.</description>

      <title>On the order function of conditionally convergent Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for the order function of a conditionally convergent ordinary Dirichlet series to be linear when it is non-trivial. This is in terms of a ``negative order'' generalisation of the abscissae of summability introduced by Bohr. It is shown that the condition is necessary in the presence of subconvexity and a functional equation, and we discuss the broader case.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems for bi-axially symmetric null-solutions to iterated perturbed Dirac equations in R^n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problems (RHBVPs) for null solutions to iterated perturbed Dirac operators over bi-axially symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Clifford-algebra-valued variable coefficients. We first resolve the unperturbed case of poly-monogenic functions, i.e., null solutions to iterated Dirac operators, by constructing explicit solutions via a bi-axially adapted Almansi-type decomposition, decoupling hierarchical structures through recursive integral operators. Then, generalizing to vector wave number-perturbed iterated Dirac operators, we extend the decomposition to manage spectral anisotropy while preserving symmetry constraints, ensuring regularity under Clifford-algebraic parameterizations. As a key application, closed-form solutions to the Schwarz problem are derived, demonstrating unified results across classical and higher-dimensional settings. The interplay of symmetry, decomposition, and perturbation theory establishes a cohesive framework for higher-order boundary value challenges in Clifford analysis.</description>

      <title>Conformal welding and the matter--Liouville--ghost factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the action of local conformal transformations on several measures related to the Gaussian free field and Schramm--Loewner evolutions. The main novelty of our work is a Cameron--Martin-type formula for the welding homeomorphism of the SLE loop measure ($\kappa\in(0,4]$); its proof relies on a rigorous interpretation (and computation) of the "Jacobian" of the conformal welding map, which we relate to the "$bc$-ghost system" from bosonic string theory. We also give an intrinsic definition of the trace of the GFF on SLE, and prove a characterisation of the free boundary GFF in $\mathbb{D}$. As an application, we introduce a new and intrinsic approach to the conformal welding of quantum surfaces.</description>

      <title>Some criteria for positive forms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of weak and strong positivity for exterior forms on complex vector spaces. We prove a dimensionality reduction argument for positive forms, which allows us to restrict to the case of $(2,2)$-forms in $\mathbb{C}^4$. In this setting, we find criteria for weak positivity based on the associated Hermitian matrix. As an application we prove, by duality, the strong positivity of some families of $(2,2)$-forms, already of interest in works by other authors.</description>

      <title>Composition operators and Rational Inner Functions on the bidisc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present article, composition operators induced by Rational Inner Functions on the bidisc $\mathbb{D}^2$ are studied, acting on the weighted Bergman space $A^2_{\beta}(\mathbb{D}^2).$ We prove that under mild conditions that Rational Inner Functions with one singularity on $\mathbb{T}^2$ induce unbounded composition operator on $A^2(\mathbb{D}^2).$ We also prove that under the condition of stability of the polynomial inducing the Rational Inner Function, the composition operator is bounded between two different Bergman spaces.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Relative Canonical Bundles and Algebraicity Criteria for Foliations in K\"ahler context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, motivated by the recent preprint of W. Ou, we pursue three main objectives. The first is to make progress towards the positivity of the relative canonical bundle in the K\"ahler setting. In the second part, we provide a proof of Ou's algebraicity criterion. Finally, based on the two previous parts, we slightly extend his uniruledness criterion.</description>

      <title>Backtracking New Q-Newton's method for finding roots of meromorphic functions in 1 complex variable: Global convergence, and local stable/unstable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with $\deg (P)&gt;\deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an initial point $z_0$ which is not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbf{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point - but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial, the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by the authors. In particular, the dynamics of BNQN (an iterative method) seems to have some striking similarities to Newton's method (a continuous method) and the classical Poincar\'e-Bendixon theorem for differentiable real dynamical systems on the complex plane. This is the more interesting given that discrete versions of Newton's method (e.g. Relaxed Newton's method) does not behave this way.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Independence of an Airy Function, Its Derivative, and an Antiderivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using tools from the Siegel-Shidlovskii theory of transcendental numbers, we prove that a nontrivial solution of the Airy equation, its derivative, and an antiderivative are algebraically independent over the field of rational functions. Courtesy of Michael Singer, the result is also derived from general considerations in differential Galois theory.</description>
