      <title>Leptogenesis in automatic Nelson-Barr models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we numerically show that automatic Nelson-Barr models with new chiral fermions can simultaneously solve the strong CP problem and generate the observed baryon asymmetry via high-scale leptogenesis. In these models, all CP violation arises from a single spontaneous symmetry-breaking scale, linking the origin of quark and lepton CP phases. Using conservative assumptions and minimal dynamics, we identify a viable parameter window where successful leptogenesis occurs without spoiling the quality of the strong CP solution. Models with vector-like fermions face tension within this leptogenesis scenario. A key prediction is a correlation between the baryon asymmetry and the induced QCD vacuum angle shift. Remarkably, we find that the majority of the available parameter space is within reach of current and future nucleon EDM experiments.</description>

      <title>Novel Phases of a Baryon-Dense QCD-like Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phases of a strongly coupled QCD-like theory at finite baryon chemical potential using s-confining supersymmetric QCD deformed by anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Focusing on the case of three colors and four flavors, we identify novel phases including spontaneous breaking of baryon number and/or parity. Both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed as the baryon chemical potential is varied. These findings may offer insights into possible phases of real QCD at intermediate baryon densities.</description>

      <title>ALPy Cogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis scenario by utilising the two-body decay of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) via an effective operator involving an axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) and a light chiral fermion $\nu_R$. This allows the two-body decay of heavy RHN into $\nu_R$ and ALP thereby generating a lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ which later gets transferred to left-handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left-handed leptons is then converted into baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. Successful leptogenesis constrain the parameter space in terms of RHN mass and axion decay constant. This has interesting consequences for both ALP and QCD axion DM parameter space within reach of several ongoing and near future experiments. We also propose a Dirac version of this scenario without any total lepton number violation. This leads to a long-lived asymmetric Dirac fermion contributing partially to DM thereby opening up more parameter space for ALP. In addition to axion search experiments, the proposed scenarios can have observable signatures at cosmic microwave background (CMB), DM search as well as terrestrial particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Experimental Determination of BSM Triple Higgs Couplings at the HL-LHC with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the Higgs potential is modified by the presence of additional scalar fields, as predicted in many Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) scenarios. In such cases, deviations in the Higgs self-interactions, in particular the trilinear Higgs couplings, could serve to disentangle the physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). While the SM predicts only one trilinear Higgs coupling, extended scalar sectors allow for additional self-interactions that can manifest themselves in Higgs pair production, via the $s$-channel contribution of a heavy $\mathcal{CP}$-even scalar $H$. We present the first sensitivity study to such a BSM trilinear scalar coupling using machine learning. Specifically, we train a neural network on the invariant mass distributions of Higgs pair production at the HL-LHC to extract $\xi_H^t \times \lambda_{hhH}$, i.e. the product of the resonant $H$ top-Yukawa coupling and the trilinear coupling of $H$ to the two SM-like Higgses in the final state, $hh$. Assuming a hypothetical $H$ mass of 450 GeV, we show that, depending on future experimental efficiencies and uncertainties, a determination of $\xi_H^t \times \lambda_{hhH}$ at the 10-20% level may be achievable by the end of the HL-LHC. We present a simple and more efficient alternative to classical statistical methods, proving the efficiency of neural networks for both hypothesis testing and parameter estimation, which outperforms conventional maximum likelihood methods in this context.</description>

      <title>Efficient many-jet event generation with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply for the first time the Flow Matching method to the problem of phase-space sampling for event generation in high-energy collider physics. By training the model to remap the random numbers used to generate the momenta and helicities of the scattering matrix elements as implemented in the portable partonic event generator Pepper, we find substantial efficiency improvements in the studied processes. We focus our study on the highest final-state multiplicities in Drell--Yan and top--antitop pair production used in simulated samples for the Large Hadron Collider, which computationally are the most relevant ones. We find that the unweighting efficiencies improve by factors of 150 and 17, respectively, when compared to the standard approach of using a Vegas-based optimisation. We also compare Continuous Normalizing Flows trained with Flow Matching against the previously studied Normalizing Flows based on Coupling Layers and find that the former leads to better results, faster training and a better scaling behaviour across the studied multiplicity range.</description>

      <title>Charmed baryon decays: $SU(3)_F$ breaking and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of anti-triplet charmed baryon decays into octet baryons and pseudoscalar mesons using the $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry framework. By decomposing the flavor structure, all decay amplitudes are parametrized with a minimal set of irreducible amplitudes, and the K\"{o}rner-Pati-Woo theorem further reduces the number of independent parameters from the original 35 to 19 under exact symmetry when small terms proportional to $\lambda_b = V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ are neglected. The independent number becomes 27 with leading $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects. A global fit to 51 experimental measurements yields a $\chi^2$/d.o.f. of 2.36 and provides precise values for the decay amplitudes. Notable discrepancies are observed in the fitted branching fractions of $\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^- \pi^+ \pi^+$, which exceed current measurements by more than $2\sigma$. Incorporating final-state rescattering effects to recover the main effects of terms proportional to $\lambda_b$, we predict enhanced CP violation, with $A_{CP}$ reaching up to $10^{-3}$ in golden channels such as $\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-$ and $\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-$. Our analysis also finds that the branching ratio for $\Xi_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+$ is enhanced to $(9.7 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-4}$ due to significant cancellations.</description>

      <title>WIMPs Below the Radar: Blind Spots and Benchmarks Beyond the Neutrino Floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate benchmark scenarios for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that naturally evade current direct detection constraints by featuring suppressed spin-independent cross-sections. Focusing on three representative models, the Singlet-Doublet fermion model, its extension to a Two-Higgs-Doublet plus pseudoscalar sector (2HDM$+a$), and a dark $SU(3)$ gauge model, we systematically analyze the interplay between thermal freeze-out, direct detection blind spots, and radiative corrections. In each case, we identify viable regions of parameter space where the predicted dark matter relic abundance is consistent with observations while elastic scattering rates lie below current exclusion limits and, in some cases, but now always, below the neutrino floor. Loop-induced effects are shown to play a critical role, particularly in scenarios with suppressed tree-level interactions. Our findings demonstrate that models with rich electroweak and scalar sectors can populate the experimentally challenging, yet phenomenologically motivated parameter space between existing constraints and the ultimate sensitivity of current-technology direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Interferometry Radii at RHIC BES Energies within the integrated HydroKinetic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a correlation femtoscopy analysis of relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies using the extended integrated HydroKinetic Model (iHKMe). The model combines initial conditions from UrQMD transport simulations, a gradual pre-equilibrium relaxation stage, viscous hydrodynamic evolution, and a hadronic cascade, providing a comprehensive description of the system's full dynamical evolution. Special emphasis is placed on the impact of extended nuclear overlap times and partial thermalization, which are characteristic of intermediate collision energies (sqrt(s_NN) = 7.7-39 GeV). The corresponding correlation femtoscopy scales, or interferometry (HBT) radii, are calculated across a range of collision energies and compared with experimental data to assess the sensitivity of femtoscopic observables to the equation of state (EoS). Two EoS scenarios are explored. The model demonstrates good agreement with experimental femtoscopy measurements, particularly at lower BES energies. These results enhance our understanding of the space-time structure of the particle-emitting source and provide valuable insight into the nature of the QCD phase transition in the intermediate energy regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. semiclassical description of in-QGP quarkonia in the quantum Brownian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the range of validity of the semiclassical approximation of a quantum master equation designed to describe the $c\bar{c}$ dynamics in a quark gluon plasma at various temperatures, in the quantum Brownian regime. We perform a comparative study of various properties, e.g. the charmonia yield, of the Wigner density obtained with the Lindblad equation and with the associated semiclassical Fokker-Planck equation. The semiclassical description is found to reproduce with a remarkable accuracy the results obtained through the full quantum description. We show that, to a large extent, this can be attributed to the non-unitary components of the dynamics that result from the contact of the $c\bar{c}$ subsystem with the thermal bath, leading to a rapid classicalization of the subsystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtoscopy offers a sensitive probe of hadron emission sources and hadronic interactions. In this study, we examine relativistic corrections to scattering phase shifts and correlation functions using the two-body Dirac equation framework. We analyze the impact of the Darwin term and spin-dependent potentials, showing that these relativistic effects, especially spin-related interactions, significantly enhance the proton-proton correlation function. Our findings emphasize the necessity of including relativistic corrections for precise femtoscopic analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the valence quark distributions of the kaons in an isospin asymmetric dense strange medium consisting of nucleons and hyperons. The comparative analysis of in-medium parton distribution functions, electromagnetic form factors, and charge densities with respect to the free space distributions is studied in the light-cone quark model. The medium effects are incorporated in these distribution functions by using the effective quark masses, computed from the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model for finite values of baryonic density, isospin asymmetry, and strangeness fraction parameters. We observe a suppression of the kaon electromagnetic form factors and a redistribution of charge density in high-density strange matter.</description>

      <title>Torsional modulation of atmospheric neutrino oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermions act as sources of spacetime torsion. However, this torsion is non-dynamical and can be eliminated using its equations of motion. The resulting theory features an effective four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. Generically this interaction is non-universal and violates parity. When neutrinos propagate through matter, they experience the effect of this geometrical interaction, which is similar to the MSW effect, but diagonal in the mass basis. Since this quartic interaction term varies linearly with matter density, its effect will be more prominent for atmospheric neutrinos specially for upward going atmospheric neutrinos. We investigate the effect of spacetime geometry on $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ and $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ conversion probability and $\nu_\mu$ survival probability, by solving the Schr\"odinger equation using the PREM density profile of the Earth. We also study the dependence of atmospheric neutrino oscillation probability on the CP phase angle in presence of this effect. We further provide a discussion of the MSW and parametric resonances in presence of the geometrical interaction.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the GENIE event generator with electron scattering data: Reduced cross section and nuclear transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced cross sections of the semi-exclusive $(l,l'p)$ lepton scattering process can be identified with distorted nuclear spectral functions. Irrespective of the type of interaction the distorted spectral function is determined mainly by intrinsic properties of the target and the ejected nucleon interaction with residual nucleus. Thus the reduced cross sections of the neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei as functions of nucleon missing momentum and energy are similar up to Coulomb corrections. Here we demonstrate the utility of this approach by benchmarking the GENIE neutrino event generator against a broad set of semi-exclusive electron scattering data for carbon target. We observe persistent disagreements between the generator predictions and data in the range of nucleon missing momenta less than 80 MeV/c. The approach presented in this paper provide a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear models of quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event generators.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Higgs Kinematics for HEFT Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a momentum-dependent reweighting strategy to extend current LHC di-Higgs analyses within the $\kappa$-framework and SMEFT into the bosonic sector of the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). Unlike SMEFT, where symmetry constraints tightly correlate multi-Higgs processes, HEFT allows for a broader range of momentum-dependent deviations that can substantially impact di-Higgs kinematics and offer a powerful probe of non-linear Higgs dynamics. We generalise the interpretation of existing experimental analyses by integrating HEFT operators up to chiral dimension four into differential Monte Carlo reweighting. We quantify the sensitivity to representative HEFT operators using multi-dimensional likelihoods for Run 3 and project the reach at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Particular emphasis is placed on how different exclusive final states, such as $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$, respond to momentum enhancements and how their complementary event selections drive exclusion limits. We further explore how rare final states, especially four-top production, can provide orthogonal constraints on HEFT-induced modifications, thereby enhancing global sensitivity to new physics effects in the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Multi-boson splashes at future colliders from electroweak compositeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new collider signature for the composite origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking of the standard model. The Higgs sector consists of new fundamental fermions (hyper-quarks), which confine at a hadronization scale $\Lambda_{HC} \sim$ few TeV. At energies above $\Lambda_{HC}$, the Drell-Yan production of the hyper-quarks leads to the production of a few electroweak bosons, in analogy with hadron production in QCD at $e^+e^- \to q\bar{q}$ around a few GeV. We show that this regime can be probed at future colliders, namely the proposed 100 TeV hadron collider (FCC-hh) and a 10 TeV muon collider. Together with the direct discovery of electroweak resonances, the multi electroweak boson signature provides a smoking gun for Higgs compositeness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the rare decay B0 -&gt; K*0 tau+ tau-, which is sensitive to potential violations of lepton flavor universality predicted by the Standard Model. A Monte Carlo simulated dataset containing both signal and the dominant background process B0 -&gt; K*0 D+ D- was used to train and evaluate machine learning classifiers. After feature selection and parameter tuning, two supervised models -- Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) -- were trained. Feature engineering was then applied to enhance classification performance. On the test set, the BDT achieved an AUC of 0.912 +/- 0.000 and an F1-score of 0.828 +/- 0.001, while the FCNN reached an AUC of 0.877 +/- 0.000 and an F1-score of 0.799 +/- 0.001. These results demonstrate that both models can robustly separate signal from background in rare decay searches, supporting their application in future LHCb analyses.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of doubly heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with heavy-quark dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the relativized quark model, the mass spectra of the doubly heavy baryons are rigorously calculated in the three-quark system under the heavy-quark dominance mechanism, by using the Gaussian expansion method and the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the obtained mass spectra of all doubly heavy baryon families, the contribution of each Hamiltonian term to the energy levels is analyzed. It is found that the spin splitting is mainly determined by the spin-dependent interactions associated with the light quark. Moreover, it is shown that the spin splitting evolves regularly with the mass of heavy quarks by the evolution of the spectral structure, which is consistent with the heavy quark symmetry. Meanwhile, the orbital excitation is dominated by the $\rho$-mode, which is different from that of the singly heavy baryons. At last, our analysis indicates that the $\Xi_{cc}^{+}(3520)$ state should not exist truly and the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}(3621)$ should be the true ground state with $J^{P}$ = $\frac{1}{2}^{+}$. It is recommended to design the corresponding experiments to search for the $\Xi_{cc}^{*}$ in the energy range from 3694 to 3714 MeV.</description>

      <title>Probing the electromagnetic dipole moment of the $\tau$ lepton in the $e^+e^- \to \gamma^*/Z \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision measurements of the lepton's electromagnetic dipole moments provide a powerful probe for testing the Standard Model. A non-zero value of the $\tau$ lepton's electric(weak) dipole moment ($d_{\tau}^{\gamma}$, $d_{\tau}^{Z}$) would serve as a smoking gun of the new physics. On the one hand, current and future high energy colliders offer an ideal environment for such measurements. On the other hand, it is essential to investigate the optimal measurement method for extracting not only $d_{\tau}^{\gamma}$ and $d_{\tau}^{Z}$, but also the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ($a_{\tau}$). In this work, we analyze the precision of observables, particularly optimal observables, for determining these physics quantities through the process $e^+e^- \to \gamma^*/Z \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ with $\tau$ leptons undergoing (semi-)leptonic and hadronic decays at the centre-of-mass energies at the Z pole mass and significantly below $m_Z$. By considering the full kinematic information of the decay products, we find that the sensitivities to Im$d_{\tau}$ and Re$d_{\tau}$ can reach $10^{-21}$ $ecm$ at CEPC $\sqrt s = m_Z$, compared to $10^{-20}$ $ecm$ at Belle-II $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance and $10^{-17}$ $ecm$ at BEPCII $\psi(2S)$ resonance. For $a_{\tau}$, we find that Im$a_{\tau}$ and Re$a_{\tau}$ with a precision of $10^{-5}$ at Belle-II $\sqrt s=10.58$ GeV can be attained.</description>

      <title>Dalitz Plot Kinematics for a Lorentz-Violating Three-Body Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rates for particle interaction processes and decays will be modified in a Lorentz-violating quantum field theory, because of changes to the particle kinematics$-$particularly through the modified dispersion relations affecting the outgoing particle phase space. We outline here these changes to the rates for three-particle decays. Considering a process with a constant scattering amplitude (not directly modified by the Lorentz violation), we calculate leading order corrections to the kinematics for a decay into three identical spinless particles whose propagation is affected by a $c_{\mu\nu}$-type symmetric tensor background. We examine the angular distribution of the daughter particles and describe the shape of the corresponding Dalitz plot outlining the kinematically allowed region, according to two toy models for the $c_{\mu\nu}$ textures. Precision measurements of the boundaries of this region could be used to constrain Lorentz violation coefficients for the particles involved in processes such as $\eta\rightarrow 3\pi^{0}$.</description>

      <title>Directional search for light dark matter with quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dark matter (DM) stands as one of the most compelling indications of new physics in particle physics. Typically, the detection of wave-like DM involves quantum sensors, such as qubits or cavities. The phase of the sensors is usually discarded as the value of the phase itself is not physically meaningful. However, the difference of the phase between the sensors contains the information of the velocity and direction of the DM wind. We propose a measurement protocol to extract this information from the sensors using quantum states. Our method does not require specific experimental setups and can be applied to any type of DM detector as long as the data from the detectors can be taken quantum mechanically. We also show that our method does not spoil the sensitivity of the DM detectors and is superior to the classical method based on the correlations of the DM signals between the detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-by-event QCD kinetic theory simulations are hindered by the large numerical cost of evaluating the high-dimensional collision integral in the Boltzmann equation. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used to obtain an accurate estimate of the collision integral in a fraction of the time required for the ordinary Monte Carlo evaluation of the integral. We demonstrate that for isotropic and anisotropic distribution functions, the network accurately predicts the time evolution of the distribution function, which we verify by performing traditional evaluations of the collision integral and comparing several moments of the distribution function. This work sets the stage for an event-by-event modeling of the pre-equilibrium initial stages in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Cross-sections and experimental signatures for detection of a well-defined dark matter WIMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the following calculations for a recently proposed bosonic dark matter WIMP with well-defined interactions: (1)~the mass as determined by fitting to the relic abundance; (2)~the current annihilation cross-section for indirect detection; (3)~cross-sections for pair production accompanied by jets in proton colliders with center-of-mass energies ranging from 13 to 100 TeV; (4)~for the high-luminosity LHC, and planned 100 TeV proton collider, detailed plots of experimentally accessible quantities before and after optimal cuts; (5)~cross-sections, and plots of experimentally accessible quantities, for production in e$^+$e$^-$ or muon colliders with center-of-mass energies up to 10 TeV; (6)~cross-section per nucleon for direct detection. The conclusions are given in the text, including the principal prediction that (with optimal cuts) this particle should be detectable at the high-luminosity LHC, perhaps after only two years with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry and odd weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the framework of non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry to include the odd weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms. The integer weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of level $N$ can be arranged into multipltets of the homogeneous finite modular group $\Gamma'_N$. We propose to construct the integer weight, including weight one, non-holomorphic polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms from the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. The previous results of even weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms are reproduced. We apply this formalism to address the flavor structure of the standard model. An example lepton model based on the modular group $\Gamma'_3\cong T'$ is constructed, where neutrino masses are generated via type-I seesaw mechanism with two right-handed neutrinos. This model can accommodate the experimental data for both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. We further extend this model to include quarks, so that the masses and mixing parameters of both quark and lepton sectors can be successfully described in terms of only thirteen real free parameters. It is the modular invariant model with the smallest number of free parameters so far, only normal ordering neutrino mass is viable after including quarks, and the correlations among the input parameters and flavor observables are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>First direct search for light dark matter interactions in a transition-edge sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing jet-medium interactions via jet substructure observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of jet substructure observables in $pp$ and PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$~TeV using a multi-phase transport model. To suppress background contamination, the constituent subtraction method is employed for both PbPb and smeared $pp$ events. The jet splitting momentum fraction ($z_g$) and the groomed jet mass to the ungroomed jet transverse momentum ($M_g / p_{T,\text{jet}}$) are reconstructed using the Soft Drop algorithm with two grooming parameter settings. With $z_\text{cut} = 0.1$ and $\beta = 0.0$, a slight modification in the $z_g$ distribution is observed in central PbPb collisions, whereas a pronounced enhancement in the high $M_g / p_{T,\text{jet}}$ region is found, particularly at low $p_{T,\text{jet}}$ and in more central events. A detailed analysis of the dynamical evolution stages reveals that this enhancement primarily originates from jet-medium interactions, whereas the contributions from hadronization and hadronic rescatterings are largely mitigated by the grooming procedure. In contrast, under a stronger grooming condition ($z_\text{cut} = 0.5$, $\beta = 1.5$), no significant changes in $M_g / p_{T,\text{jet}}$ are observed, indicating that the medium-induced modifications are predominantly associated with large-angle scattering.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Crosses the Line: Quantifying and Testing the Evidence for Phantom Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinations of the most recent CMB, BAO, and SNeIa datasets, when analyzed using the CPL parametrization, $w(a) = w_0 + (1 - a) w_a$, exclude $\Lambda$CDM at $\gtrsim\!3\sigma$ in favor of a dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter that crosses the phantom divide. We confirm this behavior and show that it persists when DESI BAO data are replaced by SH0ES $H_0$ measurements, despite the known tension between these probes in the presence of CMB data. In both cases, the constraints favor a transition from an early-time phantom-like phase to a late-time quintessence-like phase, with the crossing occurring at different redshifts depending on the dataset combination. The probability that a phantom divide line (PDL) crossing does not occur within the expansion history is excluded at significance levels ranging between $3.1\sigma$-$5.2\sigma$. To investigate whether the apparent PDL crossing is a genuine feature preferred by the data or an artifact of the linear form of the CPL parametrization, we isolate the PDL crossing feature by introducing two modified versions of CPL that explicitly forbid it: CPL${}_{&gt;a_\mathrm{c}}$ and CPL${}_{&lt;a_\mathrm{c}}$. These models are physically motivated in that they phenomenologically capture the behavior of thawing and freezing scalar field scenarios. While previous studies have primarily considered thawing quintessence as a non-crossing alternative, we find that a freezing phantom-like model is the only one capable of performing comparably to CPL -- and only in a few cases. Nevertheless, across all dataset combinations considered, the standard CPL model consistently provides the best fit, strongly indicating that the data genuinely favor a PDL crossing.</description>

      <title>Constraining exotic high-$z$ reionization histories with Gaussian processes and the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-angle polarization anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are generated by Thomson scattering of CMB photons off free electrons in the post-recombination Universe. In the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmological model, the free electron density becomes large at redshifts $z \lesssim 10$ due to the formation of the first stars, leading to reionization of the intergalactic medium. In this work, we use \emph{Gaussian processes} to give a model-independent reconstruction of the reionization history of the Universe constrained by the \textit{Planck} CMB measurements. This method gives a consistent reconstruction of the standard reionization at $z \lesssim 10$, and strongly constrains any additional high-$z$ reionization. We use our results to construct a new derived parameter expressing the high-$z$ contribution to the CMB optical depth, $\tau_{\mathrm{highz}}$. The posterior distribution on $\tau_{\mathrm{highz}}$ can be used to set accurate constraints on models for exotic energy injection, which we demonstrate for the case of decaying dark matter with particle mass in the range $\mathcal{O}(1\,\text{MeV})$. A companion paper demonstrates the use of this methodology to test ensembles of multi-axion models. Our results can be recast to different models using the provided data and code: \href{https://github.com/Cheng-Hanyu/CLASS_reio_gpr}{github.com/Cheng-Hanyu/CLASS\_reio\_gpr}.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Unified Field Theory of Gravity and the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a holomorphic framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, and their couplings to charges and currents emerge from a single geometric action on a four-complex-dimensional manifold. The Hermitian metric yields on the real slice $y^\mu = 0$, a real symmetric metric $g_{(\mu \nu)}$ giving the vacuum Einstein equations, and an antisymmetric part $g_{[\mu \nu]}$ that reproduces Maxwell's equations with sources. A single holomorphic gauge connection for $G_{\text{GUT}}$, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$, encodes all gauge sectors; its Bianchi identities give homogeneous Yang--Mills equations, and variation imposes $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu \nu}_A = J^\nu_A$. Chiral fermions arise from a holomorphic Dirac Lagrangian and couple minimally to all gauge fields, reproducing the Standard Model spectrum. Anomaly cancellation follows from holomorphic gauge invariance. A holomorphic adjoint Higgs breaks $G_{\text{GUT}} \rightarrow SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with unified coupling, and a second Higgs breaks electroweak symmetry, generating $W^\pm$, $Z$, and fermion masses. Below the unification scale, couplings run by standard renormalization-group flow. This construction unifies Einstein gravity, Yang--Mills theory, electromagnetism, and chiral fermions into a single classical geometric framework, and admits quantization via a holomorphic path integral that reproduces standard Feynman rules.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the $\Lambda$ Electric Dipole Moment through the Entangled Strange Baryon-Antibaryon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe has consistently driven the pursuit of new physics beyond the Standard Model that violates charge-parity symmetry. Unlike the well-constrained electrons and neutrons, strange baryons (hyperons) remain a largely unexplored territory, in which interactions between hyperons and particles from new physics could induce a non-trivial electric dipole moment (EDM). However, direct measurements of hyperon EDMs through spin precession are highly challenging due to their short lifetimes. In this paper, we present a novel method to extract the EDM of the lightest hyperon, $\Lambda$, using the entangled $\Lambda$$\overline{\Lambda}$ system. Our result is consistent with zero, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude improvement over the previous upper limit established in the 1980s with comparable statistics, providing stringent constraints on potential new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown to all orders of perturbation theory that in the effective field theory of general relativity the condition of vanishing of the vacuum energy leads to the same value of the cosmological constant, viewed as a parameter of the effective Lagrangian, as obtained by demanding the consistency of the effective field theory in Minkowski background. The resulting effective action is characterized by the cosmological constant term that vanishes exactly.</description>

      <title>Searching for radio pulsars in old open clusters from the Parkes archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of a pulsar in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791, we conducted a search for radio pulsars in archival Parkes observations targeting similar old open clusters. We reprocessed 224 observations totalling 75.02 hours from four clusters: Theia 1661, NGC 6259, Pismis 3, and Trumpler 20. Our analysis identified five known pulsars and three new rotating radio transient (RRAT) candidates. By comparing the measured dispersion measures (DMs) with the expected DM values for each cluster derived from YMW16 and NE2001 models, we conclude that most detected sources are likely background pulsars. However, RRAT J1749-25 in Theia 1661 and RRAT J1237-60 in Trumpler 20 have DMs reasonably close to their respective clusters, suggesting possible membership. The association between PSR J1750-2536 and Theia 1661 remains ambiguous due to its intermediate DM. These candidate cluster-associated neutron stars warrant follow-up with more sensitive telescopes such as MeerKAT or the SKA, potentially offering valuable insights into neutron star retention mechanisms and evolution in open cluster environments.</description>

Abstract: The Muon Collider, recently highlighted as Recommendation 1 in the U.S. National Academies report on Elementary Particle Physics, offers a unique opportunity for fixed-target experiments with high energy and luminosity. This paper outlines some of the challenges and possibilities for fixed-target experiments to study the multi-dimensional structure of hadrons at the Muon Collider. We present a sketch of an experiment making use of the high-energy muon beam from the Muon Collider that could serve as the next-generation hadronic physics experiment after the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the arguments of Maldacena and N\'u\~nez to include higher co-dimension brane setups and derive a new no-go theorem. Specifically, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the energy-momentum conservation and the bulk curvature, co-dimension-two branes fail to support stable de Sitter solutions. For co-dimensions higher than two embedded in a compact internal space, we show that negative tension sources would be required. This result places strong constraints on the viability of higher-dimensional braneworld models as a means to obtain de Sitter space within string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of non-dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that incorporates spin degrees of freedom into the divergence-type theory framework. Due to the divergence-type structure, it is straightforward to enforce non-linear causality and symmetric hyperbolicity of the equations of motion, ensuring local well-posedness of the initial-value problem and stability of the theory. Furthermore, in a specific realization based on spin kinetic theory, we prove that the equations of motion remain non-linearly causal and symmetric-hyperbolic to all orders in the spin potential, provided a specific thermodynamic constraint is satisfied. This framework can be applied for numerical simulations to study the dynamics of spin-polarized fluids, such as the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Chimera baryons and mesons on the lattice: a spectral density analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and test a spectral-density analysis method, based on the introduction of smeared energy kernels, to extract physical information from two-point correlation functions computed numerically in lattice field theory. We apply it to a $Sp(4)$ gauge theory and fermion matter fields transforming in distinct representations, with $N_{\rm f}=2$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental and $N_{\rm as}=3$ in the 2-index antisymmetric representation. The corresponding continuum theory provides the minimal candidate model for a composite Higgs boson with partial top compositeness. We consider a broad class of composite operators, that source flavored mesons and (chimera) baryons, for several finite choices of lattice bare parameters. For the chimera baryons, which include candidate top-quark partners, we provide the first measurements, obtained with dynamical fermions, of the ground state and the lowest excited state masses, in all channels of spin, isospin, and parity. We also measure matrix elements and overlap factors, that are important to realize viable models of partial top compositeness, by implementing an innovative way of extracting this information from the spectral densities. For the mesons, among which the pseudoscalars can be reinterpreted to provide an extension of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model of particle physics, our measurements of the renormalized matrix elements and decay constants are new results. We complement them with an update of existing measurements of the meson masses, obtained with higher statistics and improved analysis. The analysis software is made publicly available, and can be used in other lattice studies, including application to quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

Abstract: We pave the way for future gravitational-wave detection experiments, such as the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO, to constrain dark sectors made of SU(N) Yang-Mills confined theories. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by combining first principle lattice results and effective field theory approaches to infer essential information about the non-perturbative dark deconfinement phase transition driving the generation of gravitational-waves in the early universe, such as the order, duration and energy budget of the phase transition which are essential in establishing the strength of the resulting gravitational-wave signal.</description>

      <title>Experimentally distinguishable origin for electroweak symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a classically conformal $U(1)$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM), in which the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is radiatively broken by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This breaking triggers the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking through a mixed quartic coupling between the $U(1)$ Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet. For two Higgs boson mass eigenstates after the symmetry breaking, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs boson) and $h_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs boson), we calculate the Higgs boson trilinear coupling ($g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$) in the model by setting the Higgs boson mass spectrum to be $M_{h_1} &gt; 2 M_{h_2}$. For a common Higgs mass spectrum and mixing angle between two Higgs fields, we find that $g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$ in the classically conformal model is highly suppressed compared to that calculated for the conventional Higgs potential, where the $U(1)$ and EW symmetry breaking originate from the negative squared masses for the Higgs fields at the tree-level. Thus, this coupling suppression is a striking nature of the radiative origin of EW symmetry breaking. We then consider how to distinguish this origin at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) via precise measurements of anomalous SM Higgs boson couplings and the search for anomalous SM Higgs boson decay $h_1 \rightarrow h_2 h_2$ followed by $h_2 \to b \bar{b}$. We conclude that once the anomalous couplings are measured at the ILC, the observation of the anomalous Higgs boson decay is promising in the conventional Higgs potential, while this decay process is highly suppressed and undetectable for the classically conformal model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new, minimal Majorana neutrino mass matrix texture and study its predictions within a partial tri-bimaximal (TBM) mixing scheme, where $\sin\theta_{12} = 1/\sqrt{3}$ and $\sin\theta_{23} = 1/\sqrt{2}$, with $\theta_{13}$ and $\delta$ treated as free parameters. The texture forbids $\theta_{13} = 0$ and does not correspond to a $\mu-\tau$ symmetric structure. We find that the predictions show distinct behavior depending on the sign of a single real texture parameter. The texture is realized through a hybrid framework of one Type-I seesaw and two Type-II seesaw mechanisms under an extended symmetry group, $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y \otimes A_4 \otimes Z_{10} \otimes Z_{7}$ with properly chosen model parameters. The texture is seen to favor the normal hierarchy for neutrino masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$ spectra and anisotropic flow distributions are studied for charmonia and charmed hadrons produced in Pb-Pb collisions and measured with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The investigations are performed within the framework of the Statistical Hadronization Model with the transverse dynamics evaluated using predictions from relativistic viscous hydrodynamics as implemented in the computer codes MUSIC and FluiduM. With this essentially parameter-free approach, mostly good agreement is obtained for $p_{\rm T}$ spectra in the range $p_{\rm T}$ $&lt; 10$ GeV/c. The calculations suggest a hardening of the ${\rm J}/\psi$ $p_{\rm T}$ distribution for more central collisions while the data show the opposite trend. The observed wide distribution in $p_{\rm T}$ of anisotropic flow coefficients v$_2$ and v$_3$ for charmonia is also well reproduced, while their magnitude is generally somewhat over predicted. This finding may be connected to a difference in spatial distribution between light and charmed hadrons due to a different diffusion of light and heavy quarks in the hot fireball.</description>

      <title>Matching Hadronization and Perturbative Evolution: The Cluster Model in Light of Infrared Shower Cutoff Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Monte Carlo (MC) generators with parton showers that have next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) precision, the cutoff $Q_0$ terminating the shower evolution should be viewed as an infrared factorization scale so that parameters or non-perturbative effects of the MC generator may have a field theoretic interpretation with a controllable scheme dependence. This implies that the generator's parton level should be carefully defined within QCD perturbation theory with subleading order precision. Furthermore, it entails that the shower cut $Q_0$ is not treated as one of the generator's tuning parameters, but that the tuning can be carried out reliably for a range of $Q_0$ values and that the hadron level description is $Q_0$-invariant. This in turn imposes non-trival constraints on the behavior of the generator's hadronization model, so that its parameters can adapt accordingly when the $Q_0$ value is changed. We investigate these features using the angular ordered parton shower and the cluster hadronization model implemented in the Herwig~7.2 MC generator focusing in particular on the $e^+e^-$ 2-jettiness distribution, where the shower is known to be NLL precise and where QCD factorization imposes stringent constraints on the hadronization corrections. We show that the Herwig default cluster hadronization model does not exhibit these features or consistency with QCD factorization with a satisfying precision. We design a modification of the cluster hadronization model, where some dynamical parton shower aspects are added that are missing in the default model. For this novel dynamical cluster hadronization model these features and consistency with QCD factorization are realized much more accurately.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Oscillons in Scalar-Tensor Theories: The Higgs-like case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the post-inflationary evolution of a non-minimally coupled inflaton field in scalar-tensor theories, framed within the flexible framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. By focusing on a class of simplified Higgs-like scenarios, we simulate the transition from the end of inflation to the formation of oscillons using fully-fledged 3+1 classical lattice simulations. Once oscillons form, we extract their profiles and perform 1+1 simulations to evolve their radial equations. Our findings reveal that these oscillons, unlike typical cases in the literature, are relatively short-lived, due to the presence of self interactions at small field values. The radiation produced by this novel type of oscillons can quickly lead to a radiation-dominated Universe, even in the absence of additional fields or interactions. Finally, we leverage our results to derive precise predictions for the inflationary observables and the produced spectrum of gravitational waves associated with oscillon formation. Significantly, our study establishes also an upper bound on the duration of the heating phase in Einstein-Cartan Higgs inflation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

These searches are of particular interest to probe Two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) parameter space regions that predict a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. In the absence of CP violation, the investigated decay is possible if the lighter and the heavier spin-0 particles have opposite CP parities. The analysis techniques employed by ATLAS and CMS do not distinguish between the two possible signatures $A \to ZH$ and $H \to ZA$, where $A$ and $H$ denote CP-odd and CP-even Higgs bosons, respectively, if both signals are predicted to have the same total cross sections. We demonstrate the capability of angular variables that are sensitive to spin correlations of the top quarks to differentiate between $A \to ZH$ and $H \to ZA$ decays, even in scenarios where both signals possess identical total cross sections. Focusing on masses of 600 GeV and 800 GeV as a representative 2HDM benchmark, we find that a distinction between the two possible channels is possible with high significance with the anticipated data from the high-luminosity LHC, if the invariant mass distribution of the $t \bar t$ system is further binned in angular variables defined by the direction of flight of the leptons produced in the top-quark decays. Moreover, we find a moderate gain in experimental sensitivity due to the improved background rejection for both signals.</description>

      <title>No gauge cancellation at high energy in the five-vector $R_\xi$ gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel $R_\xi$ gauge in the five-vector (5V) framework within the Abelian Higgs model. In the Cartesian basis of the complex Higgs field, the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge ensures non-divergent tree-level amplitudes for each Feynman diagram in the high-energy limit. This framework pinpoints the origin of high-energy divergences in tree-level amplitudes for each diagram, providing a criterion for quantifying the degree of divergences from other gauges. The 5V description necessitates treating the Goldstone field as the fifth gauge-field component, offering deeper insight into the dynamics of massive gauge bosons, particularly its longitudinal mode. The impact of this framework is demonstrated by rigorously comparing tree-level amplitudes from the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge with those from the conventional 4V $R_\xi$ gauge and the Feynman diagram gauge, the latter of which exhibits no gauge cancellation, similar to the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge.</description>

      <title>Study of nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances from a systematic analysis of $K^\ast\Sigma$ photoproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the $K^\ast\Sigma$ photoproduction off proton is performed with all the available differential cross section data. We carry out a strategy different from the previous studies of these reactions, where, instead of fixing the parameters of the added resonances from PDG or pentaquark models, we add the resonance with a specific $J^P$ and leave its parameters to be determined from the experimental data. When adding only one resonance, the best result is to add one $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2097$ MeV, which substantially reduces the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to $1.35$. There are two best solutions when adding two resonances, one is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $N^\ast(7/2^-)$, the other is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $\Delta^\ast(7/2^-)$, leading the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to be $1.10$ and $1.09$, respectively. The mass values of the $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ in the two resonance solutions are both near $2070$ MeV. Our solutions indicate that the $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2080$ MeV is strongly coupled with the $K^\ast\Sigma$ final state and support the molecular picture of $N(2080, 3/2^-)$.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the gluon propagator to be finite at $ g^{2}_{s} /4\pi \equiv \alpha \rightarrow \alpha_{\ast} $, where $ \alpha_{\ast} = \alpha (0) $, we derive its low-momentum asymptotics. In some cases the results modify the known ones.

      <title>Influence of the residual magnetic field on the azimuthal distribution of final-state particles in photon-nuclear processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, charged particles are accelerated to nearly the speed of light, and their external electromagnetic fields can be effectively approximated as quasi-real photons. These photons interact with another nucleus via photon-nuclear interactions, producing vector mesons. These vector mesons possess extremely low transverse momentum (pT ~ 0.1 GeV/c), distinguishing them from particles produced via hadronic interactions. STAR and ALICE have observed J/psi, rho0 and other vector mesons with very low pT, which are well described by photoproduction models. This unique characteristic of having extremely low transverse momentum allows them to serve as a novel experimental probe. Recent STAR results show that the equivalent photons in photoproduction processes are fully linearly polarized, affecting the azimuthal distribution of final-state particles like rho0 -&gt; pi+ pi-. Since the polarization links to the initial collision geometry, the rho0 azimuthal modulation can probe nuclear structure. However, the post-collision magnetic field may deflect these particles, distorting the azimuthal distribution and complicating structure measurements. We simulated the distribution of residual magnetic fields over time under different collision conditions using UrQMD for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV and calculated their effects on the azimuthal modulation (&lt;cos 2phi&gt;) of photoproduced rho0. Our results show that in peripheral collisions, the field significantly alters the for photoproduced rho0 with pT ~ 0.1 GeV/c. This provides key insights for future nuclear structure studies via photoproduction in peripheral collisions.</description>

      <title>Power corrections in the determination of heavy meson LCDAs: A renormalon-based estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At leading power accuracy the QCD light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) for a heavy meson can be matched onto the LCDAs in the framework of heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) through a factorization formula. We examine the power corrections to this factorization in the renormalon model, which can associate the power corrections originating from high-twist contributions to the divergent series in a matching kernel. Our analysis indicates that the dominant power corrections originate from the virtual part of the vertex bubble chain diagrams, which generate poles at $w=n+\frac{1}{2},\forall n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $w=1$ in the Borel plane. Employing phenomenological models for both HQET and QCD LCDA, we present a numerical estimate. The results indicate that the power corrections in the peak region are approximately $22\%$ for the D meson and $7\%$ for the $\overline{\mathrm{B}}$ meson. These findings showcase the magnitude and the potential importance of power corrections in achieving high-precision phenomenological predictions for heavy mesons.</description>

      <title>Opening up New Parameter Space for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, yet the minimal production mechanism solely based on active ($\nu_a$)-sterile ($\nu_s$) oscillations is excluded by astrophysical observations. Non-standard self-interactions in either active ($\nu_a-\nu_a$) or sterile ($\nu_s-\nu_s$) sector are known to alter the sterile neutrino DM production in the early Universe, which could alleviate the tension with astrophysical constraints to some extent. Here we propose a novel solution where scalar-mediated non-standard interactions between active and sterile neutrinos ($\nu_a-\nu_s$) generate new production channels for $\nu_s$, independent of the active-sterile mixing and without the need for any fine-tuned resonance or primordial lepton asymmetry. This framework enables efficient sterile neutrino DM production even at vanishingly small mixing angles and opens up new viable regions of parameter space that can be tested with future $X$-ray and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Effect in a Twice Anisotropic Holographic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Schwinger effect in a twice anisotropic holographic QCD model that incorporates both spatial and magnetic anisotropies. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the total potential of a particle-antiparticle pair to evaluate how these anisotropies affect the holographic Schwinger effect. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic field, characterized by parameters $c_B$ and $q_3$, consistently enhances the Schwinger effect by lowering and narrowing the potential barrier. In contrast, increasing the spatial anisotropy, parameterized by $\nu$, raises and widens the barrier, thereby suppressing the process. These findings suggest the significance of treating both anisotropies concurrently for a realistic description of particle production in HIC.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, especially the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular, the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral tilt of the cosmological perturbations limit the $\alpha$ parameter of the potentials to values such that $\alpha_{n=0} \lesssim 10$, $\alpha_{n=1} \lesssim 17$ and $\alpha_{n=2} \lesssim 67$, for the $\alpha$ attractors T, E, and $n=2$ models, respectively. Using the constraints on the minimal amount of e-folds of expansion from the quantum bounce up to the end of inflation leads to the upper bounds for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for the $\alpha$-attractor models studied in this work: $\gamma_{n=0} \lesssim 51.2$, $\gamma_{n=1}\lesssim 63.4$ and $\gamma_{n=2} \lesssim 64.2$, which are obtained when fixing the parameter $\alpha$ in the potential at the values saturating the upper bounds given above for each model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, neutrino astronomy has emerged as a new window into the extreme and hidden universe. Current-generation experiments have detected high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin and identified the first sources, opening the field to discovery. Looking ahead, the authors of this Perspective identify seven major open questions in neutrino astrophysics and particle physics that could lead to transformative discoveries over the next 20 years. These multidisciplinary questions range from understanding the vicinity of a black hole to unveiling the nature of neutrino mass, among other topics. Additionally, we critically review the current experimental capabilities and their limitations and, from there, discuss the interplay between different proposed neutrino telescope technologies and analysis techniques. The authors firmly believe that achieving the immense discovery potential over the next two decades demands a model of global partnership and specialized, complementary detectors. This collaborative neutrino telescope network will pave the way for a thriving multimessenger era, transforming our understanding of neutrino physics, astrophysics, and the extreme universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for extracting energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix associated with the lattice QCD Hamiltonian. While mathematically and numerically equivalent to the recently introduced Lanczos procedure, our approach introduces a novel prescription for removing spurious eigenvalues using a kernel density estimator (KDE) and Gaussian-convoluted histogram method. This strategy yields a robust and stable estimate of the energy spectrum, outperforming the Cullum-Willoughby filtering technique in efficiency. In addition, we detail how this method can be applied to extract overlap factors from two-point correlation functions, as well as matrix elements from three-point functions with a current insertion. Furthermore, we extend the methodology to accommodate correlation matrices constructed from a variational basis of operators, with its Block formulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by computing the two lowest energy levels for a broad range of hadrons, including several nuclei. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is not significantly improved, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable than those obtained with conventional techniques. Within a given statistical ensemble, the proposed method effectively captures both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the choice of fitting window, making it a robust and practical tool for lattice QCD analysis.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Antideuteron Flux Within a Dynamical Coalescence Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic antideuterons are considered as one of the most promising tools for the indirect detection of dark matter due to their ultra-low astrophysical backgrounds. Currently only upper limits on the antideuteron flux exist, but advancements in experimental detection technology may soon lead to positive signals. A major source of background is the production of secondary antideuterons through collisions of cosmic rays with the surrounding medium. In this study, antideuteron production is modeled using a multiphase transport model (AMPT) coupled with a dynamical coalescence model. By applying a widely used leaky box model and incorporating specific processes, we present a new theoretical baseline for atmospheric secondary antideuteron flux, including a tertiary contribution, from primary cosmic rays interacting with Earth's atmosphere. Our results indicate that the atmospheric antideuteron flux are within the range of various existing calculations and remain well below the upper limits set by the Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer (BESS). The atmospheric antideuteron is found to dominate the antideuteron background at kinetic energies below $0.26 $ GeV/n.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the neutrino signals from 24 initially non-rotating, three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations carried to late times. We find that not only does the neutrino luminosity signal encode information about each stage of the CCSN process, but that the monotonic dependence of the luminosity peak height with compactness enables one to infer the progenitor core structure from the neutrino signal. We highlight a systematic relationship between the luminosity peak height with its timing. Additionally, we emphasize that the total energy radiated in neutrinos is monotonic with progenitor compactness, and that the mean neutrino energy contains a unique spiral SASI signature for nonexploding, BH-forming models. We also find that neutrino emissions are not isotropic and that the anisotropy increases roughly with progenitor compactness. To assess the detectability of these neutrino signal features, we provide examples of the event rates for our models for the JUNO, DUNE, SK, and IceCube detectors using the SNEWPY software, and find that many of the trends in the luminosity signal can be detectable across several detectors and oscillation models. Finally, we discuss correlations between the radiated neutrino energy and the evolution of the gravitational-wave f-mode.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Power Spectra, Likelihoods and $\Lambda$CDM Parameters</title>

Abstract: We present power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy in temperature and polarization, measured from the Data Release 6 maps made from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. These cover 19,000 deg$^2$ of sky in bands centered at 98, 150 and 220 GHz, with white noise levels three times lower than Planck in polarization. We find that the ACT angular power spectra estimated over 10,000 deg$^2$, and measured to arcminute scales in TT, TE and EE, are well fit by the sum of CMB and foregrounds, where the CMB spectra are described by the $\Lambda$CDM model. Combining ACT with larger-scale Planck data, the joint P-ACT dataset provides tight limits on the ingredients, expansion rate, and initial conditions of the universe. We find similar constraining power, and consistent results, from either the Planck power spectra or from ACT combined with WMAP data, as well as from either temperature or polarization in the joint P-ACT dataset. When combined with CMB lensing from ACT and Planck, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR1, we measure a baryon density of $\Omega_b h^2=0.0226\pm0.0001$, a cold dark matter density of $\Omega_c h^2=0.118\pm0.001$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=68.22\pm0.36$ km/s/Mpc, a spectral index of $n_s=0.974\pm0.003$, and an amplitude of density fluctuations of $\sigma_8=0.813\pm0.005$. Including the DESI DR2 data tightens the Hubble constant to $H_0=68.43\pm0.27$ km/s/Mpc; $\Lambda$CDM parameters agree between the P-ACT and DESI DR2 data at the $1.6\sigma$ level. We find no evidence for excess lensing in the power spectrum, and no departure from spatial flatness. The contribution from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) anisotropy is detected at high significance; we find evidence for a tilt with suppressed small-scale power compared to our baseline SZ template spectrum, consistent with hydrodynamical simulations with feedback.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Constraints on Extended Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model and set constraints on extensions to it. We derive constraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination with legacy data from Planck. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT and Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI Year-1, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that affect the late-time expansion history. We verify the near-scale-invariance (running of the spectral index $d n_s/d\ln k = 0.0062 \pm 0.0052$) and adiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are consistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light, relativistic species that are free-streaming ($N_{\rm eff} = 2.86 \pm 0.13$, which combined with external BBN data becomes $N_{\rm eff} = 2.89 \pm 0.11$), for non-zero neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.082$ eV at 95% CL), or for neutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation ($N_{\rm idr} &lt; 0.134$), early-universe variation of fundamental constants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified recombination. Our data are consistent with standard BBN, the FIRAS-inferred CMB temperature, a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a small fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant, and the late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity. We find no statistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline $\Lambda$CDM model. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored by our data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>
