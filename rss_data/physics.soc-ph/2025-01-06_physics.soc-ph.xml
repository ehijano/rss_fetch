      <title>The Effects of Anthropogenic Air and Light Pollution on Astrophysics and Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light and air pollution are the two main forms of pollution, containing the highest concentration in urban areas. I set out to investigate the effects of anthropogenic air and light pollution on the night sky, how this affects the astronomical data-collecting process, and how the general public perceives both forms of pollution. This paper utilizes primary and secondary research, referring to different sources: data collected through my telescope, astrophotography, other scientists' research, and survey responses from over 40 people across 2 areas: Southern California and Guadalajara, Mexico. Through this, I have found strong correlations between increased aerosol particles from air pollutants and increased night sky brightness, increased aerosol particles amplifying cloud formation, which in turn increases light reflection, and a correlation between different areas and what they believe about pollution, with many being misinformed on air and light pollution themselves.</description>

      <title>Garbage in Garbage out: Impacts of data quality on criminal network intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criminal networks such as human trafficking rings are threats to the rule of law, democracy and public safety in our global society. Network science provides invaluable tools to identify key players and design interventions for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), e.g., to dismantle their organisation. However, poor data quality and the adaptiveness of criminal networks through self-organization make effective disruption extremely challenging. Although there exists a large body of work building and applying network scientific tools to attack criminal networks, these work often implicitly assume that the network measurements are accurate and complete. Moreover, there is thus far no comprehensive understanding of the impacts of data quality on the downstream effectiveness of interventions. This work investigates the relationship between data quality and intervention effectiveness based on classical graph theoretic and machine learning-based approaches. Decentralization emerges as a major factor in network robustness, particularly under conditions of incomplete data, which renders attack strategies largely ineffective. Moreover, the robustness of centralized networks can be boosted using simple heuristics, making targeted attack more infeasible. Consequently, we advocate for a more cautious application of network science in disrupting criminal networks, the continuous development of an interoperable intelligence ecosystem, and the creation of novel network inference techniques to address data quality challenges.</description>

      <title>Voter Turnouts Govern Key Electoral Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elections, the cornerstone of democratic societies, are usually regarded as unpredictable due to the complex interactions that shape them at different levels. In this work, we show that voter turnouts contain crucial information that can be leveraged to predict several key electoral statistics with remarkable accuracy. Using the recently proposed random voting model, we analytically derive the scaled distributions of votes secured by winners, runner-ups, and margins of victory, and demonstrating their strong correlation with turnout distributions. By analyzing Indian election data -- spanning multiple decades and electoral scales -- we validate these predictions empirically across all scales, from large parliamentary constituencies to polling booths. Further, we uncover a surprising scale-invariant behavior in the distributions of scaled margins of victory, a characteristic signature of Indian elections. Finally, we demonstrate a robust universality in the distribution of the scaled margin-to-turnout ratios.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Computation of the Accessibility Provided by Demand-Responsive Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Public Transport (PT) cannot support the mobility needs in weak demand areas. Such areas could be better served by integrating, within PT, Demand-Responsive Transport (DRT), in which bus routes dynamically adapt to user demand. While the literature has focused on the level of service of DRT, it has overlooked its contribution to accessibility, which measures the ease of accessing opportunities (e.g, schools, jobs, other residents). Therefore, the following simple question remains unanswered: How many additional opportunities per hour can be reached when DRT is deployed? However, no method exists to quantify the accessibility resulting from the integration of conventional PT and DRT. We propose a novel method to compute isochrone-based accessibility. The main challenge is that, while accessibility isochrones are computed on top of a graph-model of the transport system, no graph can model DRT, since its routes are dynamic and stochastic. To overcome this issue, we propose a data-driven method, based on the analysis of multiple days of DRT operation. The methodology is tested on a case study in Acireale (Italy) simulated in Visum, where a many-to-many DRT service is integrated with a metropolitan mass transit. We show that, regarding the currently deployed conventional bus lines, the accessibility provided by DRT is much higher and its geographical distribution more equal. While current DRT planning is based exclusively on level of service and cost, our approach allows DRT planners and operators to shift their focus on accessibility.</description>

      <title>Review Article: Integral Role of Physics in Advancing Pharmacy Education and Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics plays a fundamental role in advancing pharmacy education and research, providing theoretical underpinnings and practical tools necessary to address complex challenges in drug development, delivery, and diagnostics. This review explores the integration of physics into the pharmacy curriculum, highlighting how principles such as fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and spectroscopy (Tokgoz and Sakalli, 2018) enhance students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it examines the pivotal contributions of physics to pharmaceutical research, including molecular modeling, imaging technologies like MRI and PET, and nanotechnology-driven drug delivery systems. Despite challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration and resource allocation, innovative teaching strategies and laboratory based learning are shown significant promise. Looking forward, the convergence of artificial intelligence and physics, as highlighted by recent Nobel Prize achievements in attosecond physics and bioorthogonal chemistry, is set to revolutionize pharmaceutical sciences, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in drug discovery and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Removing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Large Land Or Ocean Areas Will Change Earth Albedo And Force Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) can easily overwhelm the reduction in radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 due to ERW or mCDR over timescales of decades. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.</description>

      <title>Urban Scaling is hardwired in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging field of the Science of Cities has unveiled previously undiscovered facets of urban life. Contrary to the expectation of chaotic behaviour influenced solely by cultural and geographic factors, cities globally exhibit universal power-law trends in urban scaling. Leveraging recent advances in mathematical descriptions of urban dynamics, this study investigates the interplay among fundamental allometry, fractal dimension, and the number of close contacts within cities. Through a dynamic exploration of these factors, a causal relationship is established, shedding light on the intricate dynamics that shape urban environments. Remarkably, our analysis suggests that the Big Five personality traits play a pivotal role in determining the fractal aspects of urban life. This research contributes to the understanding of urban scaling and proposes a novel connection between human personality traits and the structural patterns observed in cities, opening avenues for further interdisciplinary exploration.</description>

      <title>Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach based on the use of complex networks to analyze the structure and content of curricula. We analyze the concept network built from the final year of a particular high school Physics curriculum, as well as that of Mathematics. We examine the most central nodes in each case, the community structures (coherent units or groupings), and the changes that occurred when the network was considered in isolation or integrated with Mathematics. The results show that the integrated Physics and Mathematics network has a higher average degree compared to the individual networks, driven by numerous interdisciplinary connections. The modularity analysis indicates similarities with the original curriculum layout, but also interesting differences that may suggest alternative ways of organizing the content. The differences between separated and integrated networks also highlights the prominence of certain key concepts.</description>

      <title>The distribution of violent events and interevent times in conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violent conflicts are interrupted by intervals without violence. Interevent times are said have a power law distribution, but this is only true for coarse grained data, typically with a maximal resolution of a single day. For fine grained data, with a resolution of seconds or shorter, the distribution is lognormal. By representing conflicts as a multiplicative process, it becomes clear why these two different distributions are found.</description>
