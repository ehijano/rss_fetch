      <title>Spectral and Nilpotent Matrix Orderings: Comparison and Applications in Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our earlier work, we proposed the \emph{Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering} (SNO) as a new framework that extends matrix comparison beyond the Hermitian setting by incorporating both spectral and nilpotent structures. Building on that foundation, the present paper develops concrete certificates and applications of SNO. First, we employ generalized Gershgorin theorems to design certificates for spectral ordering that avoid direct eigenvalue computation and analyze their robustness under perturbations. Second, we introduce rank-based criteria that provide certificates for ordering the nilpotent parts of matrices without requiring a full Jordan decomposition. Finally, we apply the SNO framework to linear dynamical systems, where we construct a hierarchy of stability orderings that capture both asymptotic and transient behaviors. These contributions advance the theoretical underpinnings of SNO and demonstrate its potential as a versatile tool for operator analysis, computational methods, and stability studies in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Stability Estimates for Commutativity Properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplacian $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has the property that it can explicitly be expressed in terms of $\Lambda$, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the unit ball, as $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}=\Lambda^2+(n-2)\Lambda$. In this paper, we seek to characterize those manifolds for which such an exact relationship holds, and more generally measure the discrepancy of such a relationship holding in terms of geometric data. To this end, we obtain a stability estimate which shows that, for a smoothly bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, if the commutator $[\Lambda,\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}]$ is small then that domain is itself close to a ball. We then study the case of manifolds conformal to the ball, show that a relationship as above implies a radial metric structure, and discuss stability in this setting. Finally, we provide a modern exposition of Gohberg's lemma, a foundational result in microlocal analysis which we employ as a starting step for our reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Hoffman-Wielandt inequality for quaternion matrices and quaternion matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to derive the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality and its
  generalization for quaternion matrices. Diagonalizability of the block companion matrix
  of certain quadratic (linear) quaternion matrix polynomials is brought out. As a
  consequence, we prove that if $Q(\lambda)$ is another quadratic (linear) quaternion
  matrix polynomial, then under certain conditions on the coefficients, a generalization of the
  Hoffman-Wielandt inequality for their corresponding block companion matrices holds. We also prove
  that if $P(\lambda)$ is a quaternion matrix polynomial with unitary coefficients, then any right
  eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ of $P(\lambda)$ lies in the annular region $\frac{1}{2} &lt; |\lambda_0| &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Stability of quaternion matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A right quaternion matrix polynomial is an expression of the form $P(\lambda)= \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{m}A_i \lambda^i$, where $A_i$'s are $n \times n$ quaternion matrices with $A_m \neq 0$. The aim of this manuscript is to determine the location of right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ relative to certain subsets of the set of quaternions. In particular, we extend the notion of (hyper)stability of complex matrix polynomials to quaternion matrix polynomials and obtain location of right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ using the following methods: $(1)$ we give a relation between (hyper)stability of a quaternion matrix polynomial and its complex adjoint matrix polynomial, $(2)$ we prove that $P(\lambda)$ is stable with respect to an open (closed) ball in the set of quaternions, centered at a complex number if and only if it is stable with respect to its intersection with the set of complex numbers and $(3)$ as a consequence of $(1)$ and $(2)$, we prove that right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ lie between two concentric balls of specific radii in the set of quaternions centered at the origin. A generalization of the Enestr{\"o}m-Kakeya theorem to quaternion matrix polynomials is obtained as an application. We identify classes of quaternion matrix polynomials for which stability and hyperstability are equivalent. We finally deduce hyperstability of certain univariate quaternion matrix polynomials via stability of certain multivariate quaternion matrix polynomials.</description>

      <title>Bounds of restriction of characters to submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fruitful approach to studying the concentration of Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions on a compact manifold, as the eigenvalue tends to infinity, is to bound their restriction to submanifolds. In this paper, we adopt this approach in the setting of compact Lie groups and provide sharp restriction bounds for general Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions, as well as for important special cases such as sums of matrix coefficients and, in particular, characters of irreducible representations. We prove sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of general Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, for all $p \geq 2$. Furthermore, we establish sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of characters to maximal tori and all of their submanifolds for all $p&gt;0$, and to torus-generated conjugation-invariant submanifolds for all $p \geq 2$. We also obtain sharp $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of general sums of matrix coefficients to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, for all $p \geq 2$.</description>
