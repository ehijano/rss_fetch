      <title>Topologically independent sets in topological groups and vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological versions of an independent set in an abelian group and a linearly independent set in a vector space, a {\em topologically independent set} in a topological group and a {\em topologically linearly independent set} in a topological vector space. These counterparts of their algebraic versions are defined analogously and possess similar properties.
  Let $\C^\times$ be the multiplicative group of the field of complex numbers with its usual topology. We prove that a subset $A$ of an arbitrary Tychonoff power of $\C^\times$ is topologically independent if and only if the topological subgroup $\hull{A}$ that it generates is the Tychonoff direct sum $\bigoplus_{a\in A}\hull{a}$.
  This theorem substantially generalizes an earlier result of the author, who has proved this for Abelian precompact groups.
  Further, we show that topologically independent and topologically linearly independent sets coincide in vector spaces with weak topologies, although they are different in general.
  We characterize topologically linearly independent sets in vector spaces with weak topologies and normed spaces. In a weak topology, a set $A$
  is topologically linearly independent if and only if its linear span is the Tychonoff direct sum $\R^{(A)}$. In normed spaces $A$ is topologically linearly independent if and only if it is uniformly minimal. Thus, from the point of view of topological linear independence, the Tychonoff direct sums $\R^{(A)}$ and (linear spans of) uniformly minimal sets, which are closely related to bounded biorthogonal systems, are of the same essence.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Social Navigation through Explainable Safety Regions Based on Topological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics has driven the development of algorithms that enable autonomous systems to adapt to complex social environments. In particular, safe and efficient social navigation is a key challenge, requiring AI not only to avoid collisions and deadlocks but also to interact intuitively and predictably with its surroundings. To date, methods based on probabilistic models and the generation of conformal safety regions have shown promising results in defining safety regions with a controlled margin of error, primarily relying on classification approaches and explicit rules to describe collision-free navigation conditions.
  This work explores how topological features contribute to explainable safety regions in social navigation. Instead of using behavioral parameters, we leverage topological data analysis to classify and characterize different simulation behaviors. First, we apply global rule-based classification to distinguish between safe (collision-free) and unsafe scenarios based on topological properties. Then, we define safety regions, $S_\varepsilon$, in the topological feature space, ensuring a maximum classification error of $\varepsilon$. These regions are built with adjustable SVM classifiers and order statistics, providing robust decision boundaries. Local rules extracted from these regions enhance interpretability, keeping the decision-making process transparent.
  Our approach initially separates simulations with and without collisions, outperforming methods that not incorporate topological features. It offers a deeper understanding of robot interactions within a navigable space. We further refine safety regions to ensure deadlock-free simulations and integrate both aspects to define a compliant simulation space that guarantees safe and efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>Continuous functions on limits of F-decomposable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of F-decomposable systems, well-ordered inverse systems of Hausdorff compacta with fully closed bonding mappings. A continuous mapping between Hausdorff compacta is called fully closed if the intersection of the images of any two closed disjoint subsets is finite. We give a characterization of such systems in terms of a property of the continuous functions on their limit. When, moreover, the fibers of neighboring bonding mappings are metrizable, we call the limit of such a system an F_d-compact, a particular case of a Fedorchuk compact. The stated property allows us to obtain a locally uniformly rotund renorming on the space C(K), where K is an F_d-compact of countable spectral height.</description>
