      <title>Solar and anthropogenic climate drivers: an updated regression model and refined forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper attempts were made to quantify the respective solar and anthropogenic influences on the terrestrial climate, and to cautiously predict the global mean temperature over the next 130 years. In a double regression analysis, both the binary logarithm of carbon dioxide concentration and the geomagnetic aa-index were used as predictors of the sea surface temperature (SST) since the mid-19th century. The regression results turned out to be sensitive to end effects, leading to a broad range of the climate sensitivity between 0.6 K and 1.6 K per doubling of CO$_2$ when varying the final year. The aim of this paper is to narrow down this range. To this end, the correlations between the two predictors and the dependent variable (SST) are analysed in detail. It is demonstrated that the SST can be predicted until around 2000 almost perfectly using only the aa-index, whereas for later periods the role of CO$_2$ increases significantly. Hence, the weight of the aa-index is fixed to its robust outcome (around 0.04 K/nT) from the regressions up to 1990. The SST data, reduced by the aa-contribution thus specified, are then used in a single regression with CO$_2$ as the only remaining predictor. This results in a significant reduction in the range of CO$_2$ sensitivity, narrowing it to 1.1-1.4 K. Given the exceptionally high temperatures in recent years, these values are considered a kind of upper limit that could still be subject to downward corrections when future data are incorporated. Based on this estimate, the temperature forecast until 2100 is refined by using more precise predictions of the aa-index and the paths of atmospheric CO$_2$ content which are based on constant emission scenarios combined with a linear sink model. With the exception of the most ``pessimistic'' variant, the temperature is predicted to remain below the extraordinarily high value measured in 2024.</description>

      <title>Predicting Beyond Training Data via Extrapolation versus Translocation: AI Weather Models and Dubai's Unprecedented 2024 Rainfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models have transformed weather forecasting, but their skill for gray swan extremes is unclear. Here, we analyze GraphCast, AIFS, and FuXi forecasts of the unprecedented 2024 Dubai storm, which had twice the training set's highest rainfall in that region. Remarkably, GraphCast and AIFS accurately forecast this event up to 8 days ahead. FuXi forecasts the event, but underestimates the rainfall. Fine-tuning and receptive field analyses suggest that these models' success stems from "translocation": learning from comparable/stronger dynamically similar events in other regions during training. Evidence of "extrapolation" (learning from weaker events) is not found. Even events within the global distribution's tail are poorly forecasted, which is not just due to data imbalance (generalization error) but also spectral bias (optimization error). These findings demonstrate the potential of AI models to forecast regional gray swans and the opportunity to improve them through understanding the mechanisms behind their successes/limitations.</description>

      <title>Even Small Companies Can Save Lives by Reducing Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global warming is often framed in broad planetary numbers such as the 1.5C and 2C warming thresholds, creating the false impression that individual corporations efforts to reduce emissions are meaningless in the absence of collective action. This perspective causes companies to reduce ambition towards voluntarily cutting emissions, as they believe their pollution has negligible impacts on its own. Reframing the issue to focus on the life-saving potential of individual corporate actions empowers companies to act and holds them accountable for inaction. Here, we show the results from an innovative modeling technique which calculates the avoided deaths from sustainability efforts for 3,084 companies spanning a range of sizes and sectors. From the reported emissions and planned emissions reductions, we create scenarios for 2020-2049 with and without the pledged emissions cuts and calculate the resulting warming from 2020-2100 using a climate emulator. We then use temperatures from these scenarios to calculate the deaths resulting from warming by using mortality damage functions. We find that more than 92% of these companies stand to save at least one life by following through with emissions reduction plans. Additionally, if all 3,084 companies follow through with their emissions reduction plans, over 4.4 million temperature-related deaths can be avoided.</description>
