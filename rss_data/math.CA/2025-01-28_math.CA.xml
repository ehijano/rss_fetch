      <title>Mellin Convolutions of Products and Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, convolution refers to Laplace convolution in the literature. But Mellin convolutions can yield very ueeful results. This aspect is illustrated in the coming sections. This paper deals with Mellin convolutions of products and ratios. Functions belonging to the pathway family of functions are considered. Several types of integral representations, their equivalent representations in terms of G and H-functions and their equivalent computable series representations are examined in this paper.</description>

      <title>Some examples of orthogonal matrix polynomials satisfying odd order differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that if a finite order linear differential operator with polynomial coefficients has as eigenfunctions a sequence of orthogonal polynomials with respect to a positive measure (with support in the real line), then its order has to be even. This property no longer holds in the case of orthogonal matrix polynomials. The aim of this paper is to present examples of weight matrices such that the corresponding sequences of matrix orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of certain linear differential operators of odd order. The weight matrices are of the form $$ W(t)=t^{\alpha}e^{-t}e^{At}t^{B}t^{B^*}e^{A^* t}, $$ where $A$ and $B$ are certain (nilpotent and diagonal, respectively) $N\times N$ matrices. These weight matrices are the first examples illustrating this new phenomenon which are not reducible to scalar weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any $q\in (0,1)$, all complex conjugate pairs of zeros of the partial theta function $\theta (q,x):=\sum _{j=0}^{\infty}q^{j(j+1)/2}x^j$ with non-negative real part belong to the half-annulus $\{$Re$(x)\geq 0,~1&lt;|x|&lt;5\}$, where the outer radius cannot be replaced by a number smaller than $e^{\pi /2}=4.810477382\ldots$, and that for $q\in (0,0.2^{1/4}=0.6687403050\ldots ]$, $\theta (q,.)$ has no zeros with non-negative real part. The complex conjugate pairs of zeros with negative real part belong to the left open half-disk of radius $49.8$ centered at the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present necessary and sufficient conditions on triples of weights $(u,v,w)$ for the boundedness of the dyadic weighted square function $S_w$ from $L^2(u)$ into $L^2(v)$. We use this characterization to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the $t$-Haar multipliers from $L^2(u)$ into $L^2(v)$ in terms of boundedness of the dyadic weighted square function.</description>

      <title>A varifold-type estimation for data sampled on a rectifiable set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inference of varifold structures in a statistical framework: assuming that we have access to i.i.d. samples in $\mathbb{R}^n$ obtained from an underlying $d$--dimensional shape $S$ endowed with a possibly non uniform density $\theta$, we propose and analyse an estimator of the varifold structure associated to $S$. The shape $S$ is assumed to be piecewise $C^{1,a}$ in a sense that allows for a singular set whose small enlargements are of small $d$--dimensional measure. The estimators are kernel--based both for infering the density and the tangent spaces and the convergence result holds for the bounded Lipschitz distance between varifolds, in expectation and in a noiseless model. The mean convergence rate involves the dimension $d$ of $S$, its regularity through $a \in (0, 1]$ and the regularity of the density $\theta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $k\ge 3$, we determine the dimensional threshold for planar fractal percolation to contain $k$ collinear points. In the critical case of dimension $1$, the largest linear slice of fractal percolation is a Cantor set of zero Hausdorff dimension. We investigate its size in terms of generalized Hausdorff measures.</description>

      <title>Eigenfunctions with double exponential rate of localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a real-valued solution to the eigenvalue problem $-\text{div}(A\nabla u)=\lambda u$, $\lambda&gt;0,$ in the cylinder $\mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}$ with a real, uniformly elliptic, and uniformly $C^1$ matrix $A$ such that $|u(x,y,t)|\leq C e^{-c e^{c|t|}}$ for some $c,C&gt;0$. We also construct a complex-valued solution to the heat equation $u_t=\Delta u + B \nabla u$ in a half-cylinder with continuous and uniformly bounded $B$, which also decays with double exponential speed. Related classical ideas, used in the construction of counterexamples to the unique continuation by Plis and Miller, are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Abel's problem, Gauss and Cartier congruences over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abel's problem consists in identifying the conditions under which the diferential equation $y'=\eta y$, with $\eta$ an algebraic function in $\mathbb{C}(x)$, possesses a non-zero algebraic solution $y$. This problem has been algorithmically solved by Risch. In a previous paper, we have presented an alternative solution in the special arithmetic situation where $\eta$ has a Puiseux expansion with $\textit{rational}$ coefficients at the origin: there exists a non-trivial algebraic solution of $y'=\eta y$ if and only if the coefficients of the Puiseux expansion of $x\eta(x)$ at $0$ satisfy Gauss congruences for almost all prime numbers. In this paper, we generalize this criterion to arbitrary $\eta$ algebraic over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(x)$, by means of a natural generalization to number fields of Gauss congruences and of the weaker Cartier congruences recently introduced in this context by Bostan. We then provide applications of this criterion in the hypergeometric setting and for Artin-Mazur zeta functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the problem posed in [Random Matrices: Theory and Applications, 10(03):2150027, 2021]. Plainly, let $K$ and $Q$ be two $\mathbb{F}$-valued functions over $\Lambda^2$, where $\Lambda$ is some abstract set (of arbitrary cardinality) and $\mathbb{F}$ is an arbitrary field. If $Q$ and $K$ are related via $$\det(Q(x_i,x_j))_{i,j=1}^n=\det(K(x_i,x_j))_{i,j=1}^n,$$ for every $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in\Lambda$ and $n&gt;0$, what are all the possible transformations that transform $Q$ into $K$? The aforementioned paper conjectured the following two: $(Tf)(x,y)=f(y,x)$; and $(Tf)(x,y)=g(x)g(y)^{-1}f(x,y)$ for some non-zero function $g$. Restricting to symmetric $K$ and $Q$, the same paper confirms this conjectured classification. By extending the graph-theoretic techniques of said paper, we show that, while there do exist counterexamples, under some surprisingly simple and natural conditions the conjecture remains valid even with the symmetry constraints on $K$ and $Q$ relaxed.
  By taking $\Lambda$ finite, the above problem, furthermore, reduces to that between two square matrices investigated in [Raphael Loewy, Principal minors and diagonal similarity of matrices, Linear Algebra and its Applications 78 (1986), 23--64]. Hence, our paper additionally sheds light on an underlying combinatorial structure, and presents a non-linear-algebraic proof that uses only elementary combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Weighted Inequalities for $t$-Haar multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on a triple of weights $(u,v,w)$ so that the $t$-Haar multipliers $T^t_{w,\sigma}$, $t\in \R$, %defined in \cite{P} when $\sigma=1$, are uniformly (on the choice of signs $\sigma$) bounded from $L^2(u)$ into $L^2(v)$. These dyadic operators have symbols $s(x,I)=\sigma_I\,(w(x)/\langle w\rangle_I)^t$ which are functions of the space variable $x\in\R$ and the frequency variable $I\in \mathcal{D}$, making them dyadic analogues of pseudo-differential operators. Here $\mathcal{D}$ denotes the dyadic intervals, $\sigma_I=\pm1$, and $\langle w\rangle_I$ denotes the integral average of $w$ on $I$. When $w\equiv 1$ we have the martingale transform and our conditions recover the known two-weight necessary and sufficient conditions of Nazarov, Treil and Volberg. %We will discuss some relations between the three weights inequality for these operators given the inequality for other dyadic operators. We also show how these conditions are simplified when $u=v$. In particular, the martingale one-weight and the $t$-Haar multiplier unsigned and unweighted (corresponding to $\sigma_I\equiv 1$ and $u=v\equiv 1$) known results are recovered or improved. We also obtain necessary and sufficient testing conditions of Sawyer type for the two-weight boundedness of a single variable Haar multiplier similar to those known for the martingale transform.</description>

Abstract: The multivariate Hahn polynomials are constructed explicitly as the common eigenvectors of a family of second order difference operators. They are orthogonal with respect to the hypergeometric multinomial distribution. The main difference operator is adopted from the work of Karlin-McGregor in 1975. The minor ones are the subsets of the main one containing less and less variables. These operators commute with each other. In contrast to the multivariate Krawtchouk and Rahman like polynomials derived recently, the entire multivariate Hahn polynomials are rational functions of the system parameters. Complete sets of multivariate Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are derived by limiting procedures.</description>

Abstract: The problem of finding weight matrices $W(x)$ of size $N \times N$ such that the associated sequence of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of a second-order matrix differential operator is known as the Matrix Bochner Problem, and it is closely related to Darboux transformations of some differential operators.
  This paper aims to study Darboux transformations between weight matrices and to establish a direct connection with the structure of the algebra $\mathcal D(W)$ of all differential operators that have a sequence of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials with respect to $W$ as eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Mutual Annihilation of Tiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of tiles in $\mathbb Z_n\times\mathbb Z_n$, the author observed an interesting phenomenon that if $(A,B)$ is a tiling pair with $|A|=|B|$, then sometimes $(A,B)$ is also a spectral pair and vice versa. Moreover, in such cases actually one of the components would have universality (i.e., it is the universal spectrum/tiling complement for its tiling complements/spectra). The purpose of this article is to investigate such a phenomenon. It turns out that this must be accompanied by a quite structural pattern, which shall be analyzed using the symplectic Fourier transform. Under such configuration it is shown that the phenomenon persists either (1) if $A$ is an order $n$ subgroup, or (2) if $n$ is a prime number and $A$ complements an order $n$ subgroup, or (3) if $n=p^2$, and $A$ complements the non-cyclic order $n$ subgroup.</description>

      <title>Sophomore's dream function: asymptotics, complex plane behavior and relation to the error function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sophomore's dream sum $S=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n}$ is extended to the function $f(t,a)=t\int_{0}^{1}(ax)^{-tx}dx$ with $f(1,1)=S$. Asymptotic behavior for a large $|t|$ is obtained, which is exponential for $t&gt;0$ and $t&lt;0,a&gt;1$, and inverse-logarithmic for $t&lt;0,a&lt;1$. An advanced approximation includes a half-derivative of the exponent and is expressed in terms of the error function. This approach provides excellent interpolation description in the complex plane. The function $f(t,a)$ demonstrates for $a&gt;1$ oscillating behavior along the imaginary axis with slowly increasing amplitude and the period of $2\pi iea$, modulation by high-frequency oscillations being present. Also, $f(t,a)$ has non-trivial zeros in the left complex half-plane with Im$t_n \simeq 2(n-1/8)\pi e/a$ for $a&gt;1$. The results obtained describe analytical integration of the function $x^{tx}$.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of weighted generalized $\psi$-estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of generalized and weighted generalized $\psi$-estimators as unique points of sign change of some appropriate functions, and we give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for their existence. We also derive a set of sufficient conditions under which the so-called $\psi$-expectation function has a unique point of sign change. We present several examples from statistical estimation theory, where our results are well-applicable. For example, we consider the cases of empirical quantiles, empirical expectiles, some $\psi$-estimators that are important in robust statistics, and some examples from maximum likelihood theory as well. Further, we introduce Bajraktarevi\'c-type (in particular, quasi-arithmetic-type) $\psi$-estimators. Our results specialized to $\psi$-estimators with a function $\psi$ being continuous in its second variable provide new results for (usual) $\psi$-estimators (also called Z-estimators).</description>

      <title>Functional separation solutions of the Sinh-Gordon type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: Which hyperbolic or elliptic PDEs admit functional separable solutions. We shall focus on the study of a sinh-Gordon type equation. We construct solutions to this equation via the method of functional separation. We prove that these are the only families that have the property of functional separation and so we obtain a classification. To this end, we construct new families of solutions for the hyperbolic and elliptic versions of both sine and sinh Gordon equations in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of linearization by mixing parameters of dichotomy, bounded growth and perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the smoothness properties of a global and nonautonomous topological conjugacy between a linear system and a quasilinear perturbation. The linear system exhibits a nonuniform exponential dichotomy with a nontrivial projector and nonuniform bounded growth property. Additionally, the quasilinear perturbation is dominated by an increasing exponential function. Emphasis is placed on employing a set of parameters to describe the conditions of dichotomy, bounded growth and quasilinear perturbations. Finally, we prove that modifying these conditions enables us to achieve a broader smoothness interval.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of ODE Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions in the Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to Zermelo's problem and to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>
