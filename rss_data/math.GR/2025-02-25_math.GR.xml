      <title>Generalizing the enhanced power graph of a group with respect to automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the enhanced power graph by replacing elements with classes under automorphisms. We show that the connectivity and diameter of this graph is similar to that of the enhanced power graph. We consider the universal vertices of this graph and when this graph is a complete graph. Finally, we classify when this graph is the empty graph.</description>

      <title>The product formula for Reidemeister numbers on nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the product formula for Reidemeister numbers on finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent groups in two ways. On the one hand, we generalise the product formula to central extensions. On the other hand, we derive general results for finitely generated (torsion-free) nilpotent groups from the product formula: we provide a strong tool to prove that an endomorphism on a finitely generated nilpotent group has infinite Reidemeister number and compute Reidemeister numbers on finite index subgroups of finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent groups. Using the latter, we provide an infinite family of groups with full Reidemeister spectrum.</description>

      <title>2-dimensional self-distributive non-counital bialgebras and knot invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the preprint of V. Bardakov, T. Kozlovskaya, D. Talalaev (Self-distributive bialgebras, arXiv:2501.19152) it was formulated a problem of classification of self-distributive bialgebras and was given classification of two-dimensional counital self-distributive bialgebras. In this paper, we consider non-counital case. We find all 2-dimensional algebras of this type. In constructed algebras we study the question of finding quandles for constructing knot invariants. This activity is part of the overall program for the linearization of the concepts of rack and quandle and the development of the representations theory of these structures.</description>

      <title>Self-simulable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ is self-simulable if every effectively closed action of $\Gamma$ on a closed subset of $\{\texttt{0},\texttt{1}\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is the topological factor of a $\Gamma$-subshift of finite type. We show that self-simulable groups exist, that any direct product of non-amenable finitely generated groups is self-simulable, that under technical conditions self-simulability is inherited from subgroups, and that the subclass of self-simulable groups is stable under commensurability and quasi-isometries of finitely presented groups.
  Some notable examples of self-simulable groups obtained are the direct product $F_k \times F_k$ of two free groups of rank $k \geq 2$, non-amenable finitely generated branch groups, the simple groups of Burger and Mozes, Thompson's $V$, the groups $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$ and $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$ for $n \geq 5$; The braid groups $B_m$ for $m \geq 7$, and certain classes of RAAGs. We also show that Thompson's $F$ is self-simulable if and only if $F$ is non-amenable, thus giving a computability characterization of this well-known open problem. We also exhibit a few applications of self-simulability on the dynamics of these groups, notably, that every self-simulable group with decidable word problem admits a nonempty strongly aperiodic subshift of finite type.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy geodesics and growth in dihedral Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe conjugacy geodesic representatives in any dihedral Artin group $G(m)$, $m\geq 3$, which we then use to calculate asymptotics for the conjugacy growth of $G(m)$, and show that the conjugacy growth series of $G(m)$ with respect to the `free product' generating set $\{x, y\}$ is transcendental. We prove two additional properties of $G(m)$ that connect to conjugacy, namely that the permutation conjugator length function is constant, and that the falsification by fellow traveler property (FFTP) holds with respect to $\{x, y\}$. These imply that the language of all conjugacy geodesics in $G(m)$ with respect to $\{x, y\}$ is regular.</description>

      <title>Bohr compactification and Chu duality of non-abelian locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{Bohr compactification} of an arbitrary topological group $G$ is defined as the group compactification $(bG,b)$ with the following universal property: for every continuous homomorphism $h$ from $G$ into a compact group $K$ there is a continuous homomorphism $h^{b}$ from $bG$ into $K$ extending $h$ in the sense that $h=h^b \circ b$. The Bohr compactification $(bG,b)$ is the unique (up to equivalence) largest compactification of $G$. Although, for locally compact Abelian groups, the Bohr compactification is a big monster, for non-Abelian groups the situation is much more interesting and it can be said that all options are possible. Here we are interested in locally compact groups whose Bohr compactification is \emph{small}. Among other results, we characterize when the Bohr the Bohr compactification of a locally compact group is topologically isomorphic to its Chu or unitary quasi-dual. Our results fixe some incorrect statements appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Deletion Order and Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deletion order of a finitely generated Coxeter group W is a total order on the elements which, as is proved, is a refinement of the Bruhat order. This order is applied in [8] to construct Elnitsky tilings for any finite Coxeter group. Employing the deletion order, a corresponding normal form of an element w of W is defined which is shown to be the same as the normal form of w using right to left lexicographic ordering. Further results on the deletion order are obtained relating to the property of being Artinian and, when W is finite, its interplay with the longest element of W.</description>

      <title>S-invariant and S-multinvariant functions and some symmetry groups of algebraic sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we introduced algebraic sieves, i.e. selection procedures on a given finite set to extract a particular subset. Such procedures are performed by finite groups acting on the set. They are called sieves because there are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select, for example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this article we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also introduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain permutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the action of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and multi-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective automorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such sieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant functions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the Goldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected set consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$, with $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. We have shown that one of these symmetry groups is isomorphic to a subgroup or affinity group of the ring of integers modulo N with N an integer even $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$.</description>

Abstract: For any $n$ nonnegative integer a family of groups, denoted by $ \mathcal{D}_n $, was introduce by Bianchi et al., as the collection of all finite groups with exactly $n$ conjugacy classes of nontrivial, non self-normalizing subgroups. It was conjectured that $\mathcal{D}_5$ consists of solvable groups with derived length at most $3$. In this note we verify their conjecture.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It can be described in terms of the geodesic flow and an automorphic function on a homogeneous space. This process has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums, via equidistribution of horocycle lifts.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define \[ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.\] In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <title>Second bounded cohomology of knot quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the bounded cohomology of quandles and its applications to knot theory. We establish two key results that provide sufficient conditions for the infinite dimensionality of the second bounded cohomology of quandles. The first condition involves a subspace of homogeneous group quasimorphisms on the inner automorphism group of the quandle, whereas the second condition concerns the vanishing of the stable commutator length on a subgroup of this inner automorphism group. As topological applications, we show that the second bounded cohomology of the quandle of any non-split link whose link group is non-solvable as well as the quandle of any split link, is infinite dimensional. From these results, we conclude that the second bounded cohomology of the knot quandle detects the unknot. On the algebraic side, we prove that the second bounded cohomology of a free product of quandles is infinite dimensional if the inner automorphism group of at least one of the free factors is amenable. This leads to the result that the second bounded cohomology of free quandles of rank greater than one, as well as their canonical quotients, is infinite dimensional.</description>
