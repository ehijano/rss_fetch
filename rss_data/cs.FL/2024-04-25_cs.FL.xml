      <title>The Algebras for Automatic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce "synchronous algebras", an algebraic structure tailored to recognize automatic relations (a.k.a. synchronous relations, or regular relations). They are the equivalent of monoids for regular languages, however they conceptually differ in two points: first, they are typed and second, they are equipped with a dependency relation expressing constraints between elements of different types.
  We first show that the three pillars of algebraic language theory hold for synchronous algebras: (a) any relation admits a syntactic synchronous algebra recognizing it, and moreover, the relation is synchronous if, and only if, its minimal algebra is finite; (b) classes of synchronous relations with desirable closure properties (called "pseudovarieties") correspond to pseudovarieties of synchronous algebras; and (c) pseudovarieties of synchronous algebras are exactly the classes of synchronous algebras defined by a generalization of profinite equations called "profinite dependencies".
  Building on these results, we show how algebraic characterizations of pseudovarieties of regular languages can be lifted to the pseudovarieties of synchronous relations that they induce. A typical (and running) example of such a pseudovariety is the class of "group relations", defined as the relations recognized by finite-state synchronous permutation automata.</description>

      <title>NL Is Strictly Contained in P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04840v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that NL is strictly contained in P. We get this separation as a corollary of the following result: the set of context-free languages is not contained in NL. The reader should recall that CFL is contained in DTIME(n^3)</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Monadic Second Order Definable Context-Free Sets of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the sets of graphs that are both definable in Counting Monadic Second Order Logic (CMSO) and context-free, i.e., least solutions of Hyperedge-Replacement (HR) grammars introduced by Courcelle and Engelfriet. We prove the equivalence of these sets with:
(a) recognizable sets (in the algebra of graphs with HR-operations) of bounded tree-width; we refine this condition further and show equivalence with recognizability in a finitely generated subalgebra of the HR-algebra of graphs;
(b) parsable sets, for which there is an MSO-definable transduction from graphs to a set of derivation trees labelled by HR operations, such that the set of graphs is the image of the set of derivation trees under the canonical evaluation of the HR operations;
(c) images of recognizable unranked sets of trees under an MSO-definable transduction, whose inverse is also MSO-definable.
We rely on a novel connection between two seminal results, a logical characterization of context-free graph languages in terms of tree to graph MSO-definable transductions, by Courcelle and Engelfriet and a proof that an optimal-width tree decomposition of a graph can be built by an MSO-definable transduction, by Bojanczyk and Pilipczuk.</description>
