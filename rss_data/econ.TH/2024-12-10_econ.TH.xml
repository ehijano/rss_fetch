      <title>Consumption Dependent Random Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamic random utility model that allows for consumption dependence. We axiomatically analyze this model and find insights that allow us to distinguish between behavior that arises due to consumption dependence and behavior that arises due to state dependence. Building on our axiomatic analysis, we develop a hypothesis test for consumption dependent random utility. We show that our hypothesis test offers computational improvements over the natural extension of Kitamura and Stoye (2018) to our environment. Finally, we consider a parametric application of our model and show how an analyst can predict the long run perturbation to market shares due to habit formation using choice data from only two periods.</description>

      <title>Undergraduate Course Allocation through Competitive Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing methods of course allocation at undergraduate institutions involve reserving seats to give priority to designated groups of students. We introduce a competitive equilibrium-based mechanism that assigns course seats using student preferences and course priorities. This mechanism satisfies approximate notions of stability, efficiency, envy-freeness, and strategy-proofness. We evaluate its performance relative to a mechanism widely used in practice using preferences estimated from university data. Our empirical findings demonstrate an improvement in student satisfaction and allocation fairness. The number of students who envy another student of weakly lower priority declines by 8 percent, or roughly 500 students.</description>

      <title>The emergence of chaos in population game dynamics induced by comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise description of population game dynamics introduced by revision protocols - an economic model describing the agent's propensity to switch to a better-performing strategy - is of importance in economics and social sciences in general. In this setting innovation or imitation of others is the force which drives the evolution of the economic system. As the continuous-time game dynamics is relatively well understood, the same cannot be said about revision driven dynamics in the discrete time. We investigate the behavior of agents in a $2\times 2$ anti-coordination game with symmetric random matching and a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. In continuous time the Nash equilibrium is attracting and induces a global evolutionary stable state. We show that in the discrete time one can construct (either innovative or imitative) revision protocol and choose a level of the time step, under which the game dynamics is Li-Yorke chaotic, inducing complex and unpredictable behavior of the system, precluding stable predictions of equilibrium. Moreover, we reveal that this unpredictability is encoded into any imitative revision protocol. Furthermore, we show that for any such game there exists a perturbed pairwise proportional imitation protocol introducing chaotic behavior of the agents for sufficiently large time step.</description>

      <title>Blotto on the Ballot: A Ballot Stuffing Blotto Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following Colonel Blotto game between parties $P_1$ and $P_A.$ $P_1$ deploys a non negative number of troops across $J$ battlefields, while $P_A$ chooses $K,$ $K &lt; J,$ battlefields to remove all of $P_1$'s troops from the chosen battlefields. $P_1$ has the objective of maximizing the number of surviving troops while $P_A$ wants to minimize it. Drawing an analogy with ballot stuffing by a party contesting an election and the countermeasures by the Election Commission to negate that, we call this the Ballot Stuffing Game. For this zero-sum resource allocation game, we obtain the set of Nash equilibria as a solution to a convex combinatorial optimization problem. We analyze this optimization problem and obtain insights into the several non trivial features of the equilibrium behavior. These features in turn allows to describe the structure of the solutions and efficient algorithms to obtain then. The model is described as ballot stuffing game in a plebiscite but has applications in security and auditing games. The results are extended to a parliamentary election model. Numerical examples illustrate applications of the game.</description>

      <title>Topology-Free Type Structures with Conditioning Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of the universal type structure in presence of conditioning events without any topological assumption, namely, a type structure that is terminal, belief-complete, and non-redundant, by performing a construction \`a la Heifetz &amp; Samet (1998). In doing so, we answer affirmatively to a longstanding conjecture made by Battigalli &amp; Siniscalchi (1999) concerning the possibility of performing such a construction with conditioning events. In particular, we obtain the result by exploiting arguments from category theory and the theory of coalgebras, thus, making explicit the mathematical structure underlining all the constructions of large interactive structures and obtaining the belief-completeness of the structure as an immediate corollary of known results from these fields.</description>

      <title>Efficient Public Good Provision Between and Within Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the model of Gallice and Monzon (2019) to incorporate a public goods game with groups, position uncertainty, and observational learning. Contributions are simultaneous within groups, but groups play sequentially based on their observation of an incomplete sample of past contributions. We show that full cooperation between and within groups is possible with self-interested players on a fixed horizon. Position uncertainty implies the existence of an equilibrium where groups of players conditionally cooperate in the hope of influencing further groups. Conditional cooperation implies that each group member is pivotal, so that efficient simultaneous provision within groups is an equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Feasible Payoff Set of OLG Repeated Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12988v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the set of (stationary) feasible payoffs of OLG repeated games that can be achieved by action sequences in which every generation of players plays the same sequence of action profiles. Our first main result completely characterizes the set of feasible payoffs given any fixed discount factor of players and the length of interaction. We can use this result to obtain the feasible payoff set in closed form. Second, we provide novel comparative statics of the feasible payoff set with respect to the discount factor and the length of interaction. Perhaps interestingly, the feasible payoff set becomes smaller as players' discount factor becomes larger. In addition, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition for this monotonicity to be strict.</description>
