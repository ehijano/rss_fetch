      <title>Switchable Magnonic Crystals Based on Spin Crossover/CrSBr Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progress of magnonics ultimately depends on material platforms that offer precise control of spin waves propagation. Here, we put forward a chemical strategy to create locally tunable magnonic crystals by integrating switchable spin-crossover (SCO) molecules with 2D van der Waals magnets. Specifically, we investigate from first principles a hybrid molecular/2D heterostructure formed by [Fe((3,5-(CH3)2Pz)3BH)2] molecules (Fe-pz) deposited on a single-layer of semiconducting CrSBr. We show that Fe-pz molecules are stable on CrSBr while preserving its SCO bistability, particularly in densely packed molecular arrays. By patterning Fe-pz into periodic stripes separated by pristine CrSBr regions, the interface becomes a magnonic crystal that filters spin waves at selected frequencies. Crucially, light-driven excited spin-state trapping (LIESST) enables LS-HS switching and induces up to ~1.3% local strain in CrSBr, which in turn reshapes the magnonic band structure in a dynamic and reversible manner. These results establish Fe-pz@CrSBr as a switchable platform for on-chip, programmable magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Accurate atomic correlation and total energies for correlation consistent effective core potentials II: Rb-Xe elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) to perform exact or nearly exact correlation and total energy calculations for the fifth-row elements (Rb-Xe). Total energies are calculated using various correlated methods: configuration interaction (CI), coupled-cluster (CC) up to perturbative quadruple excitations whenever feasible, and stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches. In order to estimate the energy at the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the basis sets are constructed systematically through aug-cc-p(C)VnZ for each ccECP and further extrapolated to the CBS limit within the corresponding methods. Kinetic energies are evaluated at the FCI/CISD level to provide insights into the electron density and localization of the ccECPs. We also provide data sets for widely used diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to quantify fixed-node biases with single-reference trial wavefunctions. These comprehensive benchmarks validate the accuracy of ccECPs within the CC, CI, and QMC methodologies, thus providing accurate and tested valence-only Hamiltonians for many-body electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Tunable Electronic Transport in Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ Kagome Bilayers: Interplay of Stacking Configuration and Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome lattice bilayers offer unique opportunities for engineering electronic properties through interlayer stacking and strain. We report a comprehensive first-principles study of Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ kagome bilayers, examining four stacking configurations (AA, AA$'$, AB, AB$'$). Our calculations reveal dramatic stacking-dependent band gap modulation from 0.08 to 0.76~eV, with the AB$'$ configuration being the most thermodynamically stable. All stackings exhibit robust mechanical stability with Young's moduli of 54.82-61.97~N/m and ductile behavior suitable for flexible electronics. Carrier effective masses show significant stacking dependence, ranging from 2.39-6.35~$m_0$ for electrons and 0.67-1.55~$m_0$ for holes. Strain engineering of the AB$'$ bilayer demonstrates non-monotonic band gap tuning and asymmetric modulation of carrier masses, with hole effective masses showing stronger strain sensitivity. These results establish Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform for strain-engineered kagome-based quantum devices, where stacking order and mechanical deformation provide complementary control over electronic transport.</description>

      <title>A Three-Dimensional Dodecaphenylyne-Derived Carbon Allotrope with Anisotropic and Auxetic-Like Mechanical Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce 3D-DPhyne, a novel three-dimensional (3D) carbon allotrope derived from the dodecaphenylyne framework, and investigate its structural, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties using first-principles calculations. The proposed structure forms a tetragonal, topologically complex network of four-, six-, and twelve-membered carbon rings with mixed sp/sp^2 hybridization and a formation energy of -7.87 eV/atom, comparable to other stable carbon allotropes. Phonon dispersion calculations show no imaginary modes, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 1000~K confirm robust thermal stability without bond breaking. Electronic structure analysis reveals metallic character, with multiple bands crossing the Fermi level and dominant contributions from carbon p orbitals, consistent with a fully delocalized 3D $\pi$-conjugated network. The optical response is anisotropic, exhibiting strong absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions and low reflectivity across a broad range of photon energies. Mechanical analysis reveals pronounced elastic anisotropy, with Young's modulus varying from approximately 40 to 490 GPa depending on direction. Poisson's ratio displays unconventional directional behavior, including auxetic-like responses.</description>

      <title>Engineering a Correlated Narrow-Gap Semiconductor: Effects of Ga Substitution in EuZn$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of Ga substitution on the electronic, magnetic, and low-energy responses of the Zintl phase EuZn$_2$P$_2$ is investigated by electrical transport, electron spin resonance (ESR), and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Incorporating Ga into EuZn$_2$P$_2$ (EuZn$_{1.8}$Ga$_{0.2}$P$_2$) reduces the electrical resistivity, indicating enhanced free-carrier density and a narrowed semiconducting gap. ESR confirms the persistence of Eu$^{2+}$ moments while showing a crossover from a Lorentzian to a Dysonian lineshape, consistent with reduced skin depth, increased carrier density, and the emergence of diffusive contributions. Ga-substituted compound display pronounced negative magnetoresistance linked to magnetic-polaron formation. THz-TDS reveals strong low-frequency absorption and a notable enhancement of the Drude conductivity in the substituted material, together with an increased carrier scattering time and enhanced carrier-density--to--effective-mass ratio. These results demonstrate that Ga substitution tunes charge transport, carrier dynamics, and short-range magnetic correlations in EuZn$_2$P$_2$, establishing EuZn$_{1.8}$Ga$_{0.2}$P$_2$ as a promising platform for engineering correlated narrow-gap magnetic semiconductors with enhanced electronic and spin-dependent functionalities.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst effect in amorphous Tb-Fe-Co thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive study on the compositional dependence of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in amorphous (amo.) Tb-Fe-Co thin films. The anomalous Nernst coefficient strongly depends not only on the Tb composition but also on the transition metal composition, reaching a maximum of 1.8 uV/K for amo. Tb11.0(Fe50.0Co50.0) 89.0. By evaluating the electrical and thermoelectric properties, it was clarified that this maximum is achieved by the superposition of two large contributions: S_1 arising from direct transverse electron conduction due to a temperature gradient, and S_2 resulting from the combined Seebeck and anomalous Hall effects. We discovered that the anomalous Nernst conductivity, which is attributed to Berry curvature, varied significantly with the transition metal, even in an amorphous material lacking long-range crystalline order. Our research indicates that it is possible to control the electronic states that influence thermoelectric properties, even in the amorphous state.</description>

      <title>Yb 4f-Ta 5d Hybridization and Valence Evolution in Tetragonal Tungsten Bronze Ba(3-x)YbxTa5O15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate the electronic structure of the tetragonal tungsten bronze Ba$_{3-x}$Yb$_x$Ta$_{5}$O$_{15}$ by making use of hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The core level spectroscopy shows that the substitution with Yb ions in the series first occurs on the compact S1 site. For $x\leq1$, Yb is found to be dominantly Yb$^{2+}$ with a small mixing of Yb$^{3+}$, while for $x&gt;1$, a significant increase of Yb$^{3+}$ is found, suggesting not only that site S2 favours Yb$^{3+}$, but also that their presence affects also the valency of the ions in site S1. The valence band spectra shows a relatively deep Yb$^{2+}$ doublet, but at the same time indications of a Ta~$5d$-Yb~$4f$ interaction are found, suggesting the presence of Yb~$4f$ carriers at the Fermi level through this hybridization. Our results thus point towards an exotic form of $d$-$f$ electronic interplay that together with the structural degrees of freedom can result in the unusual trends observed in the physical properties of Ba$_{3-x}$Yb$_x$Ta$_{5}$O$_{15}$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Parameter Tuning on Wavelet Transform Amorphous Radial Distribution Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding atomic structures is crucial, yet amorphous materials remain challenging due to their irregular and non-periodic nature. The wavelet-transform radial distribution function (WT-RDF) offers a physics-based framework for analyzing amorphous structures, reliably predicting the first and second RDF peaks and overall curve trends in both binary Ge 0.25 Se 0.75 and ternary Ag x(Ge 0.25 Se 0.75)100-x (x=5,10,15,20,25) systems. Despite these strengths, WT-RDF shows limitations in amplitude accuracy, which affects quantitative analyses such as coordination numbers. This study addresses the issue by optimizing WT-RDF parameters using a machine learning approach, producing the enhanced WT-RDF+ framework. WT-RDF+ improves the precision of peak predictions and outperforms benchmark ML models, including RBF and LSTM, even when trained on only 25 percent of the binary dataset. These results demonstrate that WT-RDF+ is a robust and reliable model for structural characterization of amorphous materials, particularly Ge-Se systems, and support the efficient design and development of phase-change thin films for next-generation electronic devices and components.</description>

      <title>Vector Spin Chirality Switching in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin chirality provides a powerful route to control magnetic and topological phases in materials, enabling next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies. Coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnets with Kagome lattice spin geometries host vector spin chirality (VSC), the handedness of spin arrangement, and offer an excellent platform for chirality-driven phase control. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing VSC switching and its coupling to magnetic order, electronic structure, and quantum geometry remain elusive, with experimental evidence still lacking. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence of temperature-driven VSC switching in an archetypal noncollinear antiferromagnetic manganese chromium nitride (Mn3CrN) epitaxial thin films. The VSC switching induces a concomitant quantum-geometric and Lifshitz transition, manifested through a pronounced peak in anomalous Hall conductivity remanence, a metal-insulator-like crossover in longitudinal resistivity, and a distinct evolution of x-ray magnetic circular dichroic signal. The reversal of VSC reconstructs the spin configuration, Fermi surface topology and Berry curvature, marking a unified magnetic-electronic-quantum geometric transition. This emergent behaviour, captured through magneto-transport and magneto-optic measurements, and supported by first-principles theory establish VSC as an active control knob for chirality-driven phase engineering and the design of multifunctional quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Enabled Nanoscale X-ray Photoemission Electron Microscopy (nanoXPEEM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating two-dimensional materials for real-world applications remains challenging due to a lack of effective and high-throughput characterization techniques. Soft X-ray time-of-flight photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) provides element- and depth-sensitive information of materials and buried interfaces. However, chromatic and spherical aberrations cannot be corrected with electron-lens combinations. These aberrations, combined with astigmatism and space-charge effects, significantly degrade the spatial and energy resolutions. To overcome this limitation, we outline a spatial-attention based deep learning approach to automatically correct for these effects and attain nanometer resolution over the entire field-of-view (FoV). The combination of this corrective algorithm with XPEEM, termed as nanoXPEEM, establishes a new record of 48-nm spatial resolution with a 232-micrometer diameter FoV in the soft x-ray regime (700-1000 eV). nanoXPEEM provides unique spatial mapping of the element-specificity, depth-sensitivity, and local structure on the nanoscale. It can bridge the current gap to achieve angstrom (atomic) scale resolution.</description>

      <title>In-operando dipole orientation for bipolar injection from air-stable electrodes into organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient charge-carrier injection from air-stable electrodes into organic semiconductors (OSCs) is essential for fabricating solution-processed organic optoelectronic devices under ambient conditions. Today, this is typically achieved by incorporating doped OSC interlayers, introducing self-assembled dipole monolayers, or adding mobile ions to the active material (AM). Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach that eliminates the need for additional injection layers or ionic additives. We achieve this by blending the dipolar compound TMPE-OH into the electroluminescent polymer Super Yellow (SY) and depositing this sole AM between two air-stable electrodes, forming a single-layer, dipole-doped OLED (D-OLED). By tracking its transient voltage-luminance response, performing impedance spectroscopy, and comparing these characteristics with two other single-layer device concepts, i.e. a neat-SY OLED without a dipolar compound and a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) containing mobile ions, we can establish that the auxiliary dipoles in the D-OLED reorient under the applied driving voltage, enabling immediate luminance turn-on and lowering the injection barriers at both electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate that the D-OLED achieves current efficacies comparable to those of SY OLEDs incorporating dedicated injection layers or LECs. Our study establishes dipolar doping as a practical strategy for efficient bipolar charge injection from air-stable electrodes in solution-processed organic semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Spinless electric toroidal multipoles in ferroaxial ${\rm K_2Zr(PO_4)_2}$ revealed by symmetry-adapted closest Wannier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a symmetry perspective, ferroaxial order belongs to the same symmetry as time-reversal-even pseudovectors. Experimentally, ${\rm K_2Zr(PO_4)_2}$ is known to undergo a displacive-type phase transition from a non-ferroaxial to a ferroaxial phase. To identify the key microscopic ingredients driving this transition, we carry out a quantitative analysis combining density-functional theory calculations and symmetry-adapted closest Wannier analysis. As a result, we show that electric toroidal dipole, electric toroidal octupole, and electric hexadecapole, which belong to the same irreducible representation, make dominant contributions to the ferroaxial transition. In particular, we find that spinless electric toroidal octupoles, which originate from spin-independent off-diagonal real hopping between the $p$ orbitals on P and O atoms and between the $d$ orbitals on Zr atoms and $p$ orbitals on O atoms, provide the most significant contributions. Moreover, we explicitly analyze the orbital characters involved in the relevant hybridizations associated with these multipoles. We further show that the relativistic spin--orbit coupling has a negligible influence on the ferroaxial transition. These results demonstrate that spin-independent orbital hybridization between different orbitals on different atoms plays a crucial role in inducing the ferroaxial transition.</description>

      <title>Switchable Giant Spin Injection Current in Janus Altermagnet Fe$_2$SSeO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating and controlling spin current in miniaturized magnetic quantum devices remains a central objective of spintronics, due to its potential to enable future energy-efficient information technologies. Among the existing magnetic phases, altermagnetism have recently emerged as a highly promising platform for spin current generation and control, going beyond ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Here, we propose a symmetry-allowed spin photovoltaic effect in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic semiconductors that enables predictable control of giant spin injection currents. Distinct from parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-antiferromagnets, Janus altermagnetic semiconductors generate not only shift current but also a unique injection current with spin momentum locked in a specific direction under linearly polarized light -- a mechanism absent in $\mathcal{PT}$-antiferromagnets. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify Janus Fe$_2$SSeO as a promising candidate. Specifically, the monolayer Fe$_2$SSeO exhibits a polarization-dependent injection conductivity reaching $\sim$1,200~$\mu$A/V$^{2}\!\cdot\!\hbar/2e$, and the giant spin injection current can be effectively switched by rotating the magnetization direction and engineering strains. These findings underscore the potential of 2D altermagnets in spin photovoltaics and open avenues for innovative quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Ptsingle bondRu overlays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of electrodeposited Pt, Ru and Pt-Ru overlays for high-temperature oxidation protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru), both members of the platinum-group metals (PGMs), are renowned for their exceptional resistance to corrosion, oxidation, and high temperatures, making them promising candidates for advanced high-temperature applications. This study investigates the direct current (DC) electrodeposition of Pt, Ru, and a binary Pt-Ru alloy onto NiCoCrAlYTa-coated single-crystal superalloy CMSX-4, along with their vacuum annealing and respective effects on the isothermal oxidation behavior of the system at 1100 {\deg}C. All the electrodeposited overlays demonstrated substantial enhancement in oxidation resistance. However, Pt exhibited the highest protection efficiency, Ru the least, and the Pt-Ru alloy provided an intermediate level of performance. Microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the competitive formation of protective {\alpha}-Al2O3 and spinel NiAl2O4 phases on the coated surfaces played a crucial role in determining the oxidation resistance, driven by atomic interactions between the elements in the NiCoCrAlYTa bond coat and the overlay metals. Despite Ru's relatively lower oxidation resistance compared to Pt, its significantly lower cost offers potential advantages in cost-sensitive, high-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing Pt-group metal coatings for durability in high-performance systems.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, Structural, and Electronic Properties of CrOCl with the PBE Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrOCl is a van der Waals-layered insulator with an antiferromagnetic ground state, making it a promising platform for exfoliation and the exploration of low-dimensional magnetism. An accurate ab initio description is therefore essential. Previous density-functional studies have shown that DFT+$U$ calculations may erroneously favor ferromagnetic order depending on the choice of parametrization, an issue that cannot be remedied by simply adjusting the value of $U$. Here, we demonstrate that an explicit Hubbard correction is unnecessary: the PBE functional correctly reproduces the AFM ground state while simultaneously improving the description of structural properties. Moreover, PBE provides a reliable account of the electronic structure. These findings clarify the role of correlation effects in CrOCl and identify PBE as a robust starting point for future ab initio studies of CrOCl-based materials.</description>

      <title>Bandgap Engineering for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells Under Multiple Color Temperature Indoor Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs) are emerging as a transformative technology for low-light intensity energy harvesting, owing to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), low-cost fabrication, solution-processability, and compositionally tunable band gaps. In this work, methylammonium-free perovskite absorbers were compositionally engineered to achieve band gaps of 1.55, 1.72, and 1.88 eV, enabling matching the spectral photoresponse with the indoor lighting. Devices based on a scalable mesoscopic n-i-p architecture were systematically evaluated under white LED illumination across correlated color temperatures (3000-5500 K) and light intensities from 250 to 1000 lux with active area of 1 cm2. The 1.72 eV composition exhibited the most promising performance across different light intensities and colors, achieving PCEs of 35.04 % at 1000 lux and 36.6 % at 250 lux, with a stable device operation of over 2000 hours. On the other hand, the 1.88 eV band-gap variant reached a peak PCE of 37.4 % under 250 lux (5500 K), however performance trade-offs were observed across the different color lights LEDs. Our combined experimental and theoretical optical-electrical simulations suggest that decreasing trap-assisted recombination in wide-bandgap compositions may further improve PIPV performance across the different illumination conditions. In contrast, devices with 1.55 eV band gap underperformed in such conditions due to suboptimal spectral overlap and utilization. These findings establish bandgap optimization and device architecture as key design principles for high-efficiency, stable PIPVs, advancing their integration into self-powered electronic systems and innovative indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Structure and Magnetic Properties of Vacuum-Annealed CoFeB Thin Films: From Amorphous Alloy to Metastable (Co,Fe)23B6 tau-Boride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled crystallization of amorphous alloys offers a powerful route to tailor magnetic and structural properties at the nanoscale. Thin films of CoFeB alloy are essential for the development of various spintronic devices. The crystallization mechanisms of CoFeB during the annealing process have been thoroughly investigated in earlier studies, demonstrating that boron diffuses from the amorphous film, allowing the remaining CoFe to form a body-centered cubic lattice. Here, a distinct transformation pathway in pulsed-laser-deposited amorphous Co40Fe40B20 films is revealed, where vacuum annealing drives the formation of a metastable tau-boride phase, (Co,Fe)23B6. Comprehensive structural characterization - combining X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and compositional analysis - proves that tau-boride forms with high crystalline quality and minimal boron loss. Following the transition from amorphous CoFeB films to crystalline (Co,Fe)23B6, an improvement of magnetic properties is observed, with corresponding increases in such values as saturation magnetization, coercivity, loop squareness, and average magnetic moment. The reproducible stabilization of a boron-rich metastable phase in CoFeB thin films expands the known crystallization landscape of this technologically important alloy system. These findings provide new insight into phase engineering in transition-metal borides and open opportunities for designing nanostructured magnetic materials with tunable functionality for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of dominant ultrafast diffusive energy transport by hot electrons in Cu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the dimensions of structures shrink to the order of the inelastic mean free path of the energy-carrying quasi-particles, the character of energy transport changes from diffusive to ballistic. However, the point of transition remains a matter of debate. Here, we determine the dominant channel of energy transport through a nanoscale Cu layer as a function of its thickness. The energy rapidly transferred across Cu via hot electrons from a photo-excited Pt layer into a buried Ni detection layer translates into a rapid expansion of the Ni layer probed via ultrafast x-ray diffraction. The non-linear dependence of the Ni strain amplitude on the absorbed laser fluence indicates that the transport through Cu becomes more efficient with increasing fluence. This fluence-dependent transport efficiency is reproduced by a diffusive energy transport model and serves as a generally applicable experimental approach to distinguish diffusion from ballistic transport. Following this approach, we identify diffusive electronic energy transport to govern the spatial energy distribution for Cu layer thicknesses larger than twice the electronic inelastic mean free path.</description>

      <title>Multipoles as quantitative order parameters for altermagnetic spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relation between the altermagnetic spin-splitting and different higher order multipoles of the charge and magnetization density around the magnetic atoms. Magnetic multipoles such as octupoles or triakontadipoles have been suggested as potential ferroic order parameters for d- and g-wave altermagnetism, respectively, based mainly on qualitative symmetry arguments. We use first-principles-based electronic structure calculations to establish a clear quantitative relation between the strength of the altermagnetic spin splitting and the magnitude of certain local multipoles. We vary the magnitude of these multipoles either by applying an appropriate constraint on the charge density or by varying a corresponding structural distortion mode, using two simple perovskite materials, SrCrO3 and LaVO3, as model systems. Our analysis indicates that in general the altermagnetic spin splitting is not exclusively determined by the lowest order nonzero magnetic multipole, but results from a superposition of contributions from different multipoles with comparable strength, suggesting the need for a multi-component order parameter to describe altermagnetism. We also discuss different measures to quantify the overall spin-splitting of a material, without relying on features that might be specific to only individual bands.</description>

      <title>Thermal Control of Size Distribution and Optical Properties in Gallium Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summarized abstract- Gallium nanoparticles (Ga-NPs) display tunable plasmonic resonances from the ultraviolet to the infrared, but achieving uniform and ordered Ga-NP arrays is hindered by coarsening-induced size dispersion during physical deposition. Here, the effect of substrate temperature on nucleation, growth, and homogenization of Ga-NPs thermally evaporated on GaAs is systematically analyzed using atomic force and scanning electron microscopies. An optimal 300-350 celsius degrees window yields narrowly dispersed, dense arrays, whereas higher temperatures enhance surface diffusion and desorption, producing larger, sparser, and morphologically relaxed (flattened) NPs. Temperature-dependent optical reflectance reveals localized surface plasmon resonances whose energies scale with NP size and aspect ratio, and a figure of merit combining density and size dispersion identifies intermediate temperatures as optimal, in agreement with increased plasmonic quality factors. In-situ post-deposition annealing demonstrates Ostwald ripening as the dominant high-temperature coarsening pathway and underscores the need for rapid cooling and oxide-shell stabilization to preserve homogeneity. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirm a core-shell architecture, quantify temperature-driven oxide thickening, and verify the liquid-metal nature of the Ga NPs core. Finally, extended deposition tests show that temperature-driven size homogenization persists for larger NPs, establishing a general framework for thermal control of uniformity and optical performance in Ga-NP arrays suitable for plasmonic devices.</description>

      <title>Single Ion Anisotropy of $Ln^{3+}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho) Controls Magnetic Excitations in $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ Ferrimagnetic Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ family of materials, where $Ln^{3+}$ is a lanthanide trivalent cation, have attracted extensive interest due to the interplay of electronic structure, magnetism, and topology present in this family that gives rise to complex electronic and magnetic phenomena. Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise detection of palladium (Pd) ions is a critical challenge with significant socio-economic implications across various industrial and chemical sectors. Due to its widespread use and poor biodegradability, Pd2+ accumulates in environmental ecosystems, posing severe risks to both the environment and living organisms. Consequently, there is a strong demand for selective, sensitive, and user-friendly detection methods. Among emerging strategies, optical detection techniques (both luminescent and colorimetric) using metal-based receptors have gained considerable attention. These sensors offer distinct advantages over traditional organic probes, including large Stokes shifts, long emission lifetimes, exceptional photostability, enhanced water solubility, recyclability, and remarkable chemical versatility. These attributes make them highly suitable for diverse applications in sensing and bioanalytical fields. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in luminescent and colorimetric metal-based probes, including metal complexes and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), for the selective detection of Pd2+. It discusses key design strategies, critical performance factors, and future prospects, offering valuable insights for researchers working on next-generation sensing platform.</description>

      <title>Corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings tailored for ultra-low Pt-loaded BPPs and PTLs in PEM electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop highly corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings for metallic components -- bipolar plates (BPPs) and porous transport layers (PTLs) -- in PEM water electrolyzers. Using reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), we deposit compact 200 nm bilayer coatings onto SS316L substrates, systematically tailoring their composition. By precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure and Nb/Ti ratio, we adjust stoichiometry and structure, directly affecting electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance. We examine interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and electrochemical parameters before and after accelerated corrosion testing. Optimized coatings exhibit resistivity on the order of 10^-4 Ohmcm and extremely low corrosion current densities (J_corr = 0.01-0.08 uA/cm^2), well below the U.S. DOE 2026 target. Most importantly, these coatings enable the ICR target after accelerated corrosion testing with a Pt overlayer as thin as 5 nm, reducing Pt loading by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches.</description>

Abstract: Donor-$\pi$-acceptor (D-$\pi$-A) functionalization of MOF linkers can enhance visible-light photocatalytic activity, yet the mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. Here we combine EPR spectroscopy, transient photoluminescence, and first-principles calculations to examine how diazo-coupled anisole, diphenylamine (DPA), and N,N-dimethylaniline (NNDMA) groups modify the photophysics of UiO-66-NH$_2$. All donor units introduce new occupied states near the valence-band edge, enabling charge separation through dye-to-framework electron transfer. Among them, the anisole-modified material stands out for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing into a triplet charge-transfer configuration that suppresses fast recombination and yields long-lived charge carriers detectable by photo-EPR. Meanwhile, bulkier donors such as DPA and NNDMA - despite their stronger electron-donating character - also tend to introduce defect-associated trap states. These results underscore the interplay between donor-induced electronic-structure changes, triplet pathways, and defect-mediated recombination, offering a mechanistic basis for tuning photocatalytic response in D-$\pi$-A-modified MOFs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Methods for the Investigation of Temperature-Dependence in Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature-dependent transport data, including diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities, are routinely analysed by fitting empirical models such as the Arrhenius equation. These fitted models yield parameters such as the activation energy, and can be used to extrapolate to temperatures outside the measured range. Researchers frequently face challenges in this analysis: quantifying the uncertainty of fitted parameters, assessing whether the data quality is sufficient to support a particular empirical model, and using these models to predict behaviour at extrapolated temperatures. Bayesian methods offer a coherent framework that addresses all of these challenges. This tutorial introduces the use of Bayesian methods for analysing temperature-dependent transport data, covering parameter estimation, model selection, and extrapolation with uncertainty propagation, with illustrative examples from molecular dynamics simulations of superionic materials.</description>

      <title>InfinityEBSD : Metrics-Guided Infinite-Size EBSD Map Generation With Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials performance is deeply linked to their microstructures, which govern key properties such as strength, durability, and fatigue resistance. EBSD is a major technique for characterizing these microstructures, but acquiring large and statistically representative EBSD maps remains slow, costly, and often limited to small regions. In this work, we introduce InfinityEBSD, a diffusion-based method for generating monophase realistic EBSD maps of arbitrary size, conditioned on physically meaningful microstructural metrics. This approach supports two primary use cases: extending small experimental EBSD maps to arbitrary sizes, and generating entirely new maps directly from statistical descriptors, without any input map. Conditioning is achieved through eight microstructural descriptors, including grain size, grain perimeter, grain inertia ratio, coordination number and disorientation angle distribution, allowing the model to generate maps that are both visually realistic and physically interpretable. A patch-wise geometric extension strategy ensures spatial continuity across grains, enabling the model to produce large-scale EBSD maps while maintaining coherent grain boundaries and orientation transitions. The generated maps can also be exported as valid Channel Text Files (CTF) for immediate post-processing and analysis in software such as MTEX or simulation environments like DIGIMU. We quantitatively validate our results by comparing distributions of the guiding metrics before and after generation, showing that the model respects the statistical targets while introducing morphological diversity. InfinityEBSD demonstrates that diffusion models, guided by physical metrics, can bridge the gap between synthetic and realistic materials representation, paving the way for future developments such as 3D realistic microstructure generation from 2D data.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Defects and the Charge Density Wave State in Hf-Doped ZrTe$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out temperature-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of the charge density wave (CDW) compound ZrTe$_3$ which is intentionally doped with Hf. Previous bulk studies tie Hf doping to an enhancement of the CDW transition temperature (T$_{CDW}$). In our work, by combining STM measurements with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we observe and identify multiple defects in Zr$_{0.95}$Hf$_{0.05}$Te$_3$. Surprisingly, instead of finding clear structural or electronic signatures associated with Hf dopants, we determine the origin of the observed defects are consistent with Te and Zr vacancies. Further, our temperature dependent STM measurements allow us to examine CDW pinning to both types of observed defects below and above T$_{CDW}$.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Mapping the Phase Diagrams of Photoexcited Small Polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental properties that dictate photoexcited polarons in materials is critical to tuning their properties. Theoretical models of polarons have only recently been extended to the excited state. Experimental measurements of polaron formation and transport have been widely undertaken across a range of materials, from photocatalysts and superconductors to soft conducting polymers. Here, we map experimental measurements of quantities such as polaron strength onto phase diagrams of the Holstein, Hubbard-Holstein, and t-J-Holstein models. This work demonstrates that tuning electron-phonon coupling strength, electron localization, and spin exchange can be leveraged to suppress or control polaron formation in transition metal oxides. We find that the t-J-Holstein model best describes the measured iron oxides and could be generally applied to a wide range of systems that exhibit polaron formation in the excited state. This work combines experimental data with ground state models to provide a robust parameter space for informing photoexcited polaron design.</description>

      <title>Single-$q$ Cycloid and Double-$q$ Vortex Lattices in Layered Magnetic Semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a host of exotic magnetic textures such as topologically protected skyrmion lattices has been discovered in several bulk metallic lanthanide compounds. In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moir\'{e} superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \textit{i.e.}, spin moir\'{e} superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials.</description>

      <title>Cascade of Spin Moir\'e Superlattices with In-Plane Field in Triangle Lattice Semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ is a rhombohedral europium triangle lattice material that exhibits a rich phase diagram of spin moir\'{e} superlattices (SMS) and single-$q$ magnetic phases. In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\text{F}}$. We also compare with a phenomenological model of the phase diagram. The richness of phases revealed in this study hint at the frustrated nature of the incommensurate magnetism present in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ and motivate further probes of these phases and the origin of the stability of spin moir\'{e} superlattices. Finally, the coupling of the multi-$q$ nature and $q=2k_{\text{F}}$ commensuration condition reveals the key requirements for a strong SMS transport response.</description>

      <title>Impact of strong electronic correlations on altermagnets: the case of NiS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the distinguishing features of an altermagnet is that its spin-up and spin-down bands display a nodal momentum-dependent splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sample-Based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization for Heisenberg Models with Applications to Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) algorithm on one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg models, including strongly correlated regimes in which the ground state is dense. Using problem-informed initial states and magnetization-sector sweeps, SKQD accurately reproduces ground-state energies and field-dependent magnetization across a range of anisotropies. Benchmarks against DMRG and exact diagonalization show consistent qualitative agreement, with accuracy improving systematically in more anisotropic regimes. We further demonstrate SKQD on quantum hardware by implementing 18- and 30-qubit Heisenberg chains, obtaining magnetization curves that match theoretical expectations. Simulations on small 2D square-lattice systems further demonstrate that the method applies effectively beyond 1D geometries.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a hidden-order phase well below the charge density wave transition in a topological Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) in a Weyl semimetal -- a correlated topological phase, is exceptionally rare in condensed matter systems. In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($\alpha$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching the phase diagram of this material and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders.</description>

Abstract: We study how topological crystalline defects--dislocations--reshape the real-space quantum geometric tensor and act as tunable sources of quantum geometry. We show that dislocations strongly enhance the quantum metric, establishing a direct link between lattice topology and the Hilbert-space geometry of states. We characterize the quantum geometry of topological magnons in ordered arrays of dislocations, demonstrating that defect-induced geometric enhancement controls their localization and topological protection. In disordered arrays, dislocation-driven geometry expands the accessible topological phase space and enables transitions to disorder-induced topological phases. Our results identify the quantum metric as a tunable bridge between crystalline topology, magnonic excitations, and emergent topological matter in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Surrogate Creep Modelling in Inconel 625: A High-Temperature Alloy Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent deformation, particularly creep, in high-temperature alloys such as Inconel 625 is a key factor in the long-term reliability of components used in aerospace and energy systems. Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds. The proposed framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring, and provides a scalable solution for high-temperature alloy applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Halbach Spheres -- Icosahedral Symmetry Is Not Just Cool Anymore</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halbach spheres provide a theoretically elegant means of generating highly homogeneous magnetic fields, but practical implementation is hindered by challenging fabrication and restricted interior access. This study examines discrete spherical Halbach configurations assembled from permanent magnets placed at the vertices of Platonic and Archimedean solids. Analytical calculations, numerical field simulations, and experimental measurements indicate that polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry achieve the most favorable balance among field strength, homogeneity, and interior accessibility. They produce exceptionally flat fourth-order central saddle points, resulting in a usable homogeneous field volume up to a factor of 260 larger than that of traditional Halbach disk or cylindrical arrays. Several magnet assemblies composed of cubical NdFeB magnets are fabricated and their three dimensional field distributions characterized, demonstrating homogeneous regions of up to several cubic centimeters with deviations below 1%. The findings establish discrete icosahedrally symmetric magnet arrays as practical, scalable building blocks for compact, highly homogeneous magnetic field sources suited to mobile magnetic resonance, and magnetophoretic applications.</description>

      <title>Charge fluctuations and topological phases in Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological phases in doped Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders by studying the competition with itinerant electrons and the associated charge fluctuations in a Hubbard model on a honeycomb ribbon geometry. We analyze the evolution of string order parameters, spin correlations, and charge fluctuations as functions of hopping amplitude and interaction strength in a half-filled band. Our results from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that increasing electron bandwidth progressively suppresses the topological phases, shifting and narrowing their stability regions in the phase diagram. We identify the critical values of hopping where string order vanishes and characterize the interplay between magnetic order and charge fluctuations. These findings provide insight into the robustness of topological phases against doping and charge dynamics, with implications for candidate Kitaev materials and engineered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic-enhanced Raman scattering in van der Waals MoOCl2: from Fano resonances to picomolar detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural van der Waals (vdW) crystals with hyperbolic dispersion challenge artificial metamaterials but remain confined to the mid-infrared spectrum. The emergence of MoOCl2, a quasi-one-dimensional metal with in-plane hyperbolicity, overcomes this spectral limit, shifting the focus to the practical visible range. Here, utilizing angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we uncover a highly anisotropic vibrational response characterized by pronounced Fano resonances and polarization switching, which serve as signatures of strong coupling between phonons and the metallic continuum. Harnessing this interaction, we demonstrate "Hyperbolic-Enhanced Raman" (HypER) scattering, where MoOCl2 provides polarization-tunable enhancement factors exceeding 10^7 and picomolar-level detection down to 100 pM, without any nanostructuring. These results establish MoOCl2 as a simple, air-stable, wafer-compatible platform for visible-range hyperbolic nanophotonics and lithography-free sensing.</description>

      <title>Generative Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Scalable Batch Evaluations for Sample-Efficient De Novo Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing molecules that must satisfy multiple, often conflicting objectives is a central challenge in molecular discovery. The enormous size of chemical space and the cost of high-fidelity simulations have driven the development of machine learning-guided strategies for accelerating design with limited data. Among these, Bayesian optimization (BO) offers a principled framework for sample-efficient search, while generative models provide a mechanism to propose novel, diverse candidates beyond fixed libraries. However, existing methods that couple the two often rely on continuous latent spaces, which introduces both architectural entanglement and scalability challenges. This work introduces an alternative, modular "generate-then-optimize" framework for de novo multi-objective molecular design/discovery. At each iteration, a generative model is used to construct a large, diverse pool of candidate molecules, after which a novel acquisition function, qPMHI (multi-point Probability of Maximum Hypervolume Improvement), is used to optimally select a batch of candidates most likely to induce the largest Pareto front expansion. The key insight is that qPMHI decomposes additively, enabling exact, scalable batch selection via only simple ranking of probabilities that can be easily estimated with Monte Carlo sampling. We benchmark the framework against state-of-the-art latent-space and discrete molecular optimization methods, demonstrating significant improvements across synthetic benchmarks and application-driven tasks. Specifically, in a case study related to sustainable energy storage, we show that our approach quickly uncovers novel, diverse, and high-performing organic (quinone-based) cathode materials for aqueous redox flow battery applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum heat current in Terahertz-driven phonon systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-intensity ultrafast laser pulses has opened new opportunities for controlling and designing quantum materials. In particular, terahertz (THz) pulses can resonantly drive optical phonon modes, enabling dynamic manipulation of lattice degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate the ultrafast quantum thermodynamics of optical phonon mode driven by a THz pulse by treating the phonon as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment within a Caldeira-Leggett-type framework. We derive the quantum heat current between the phonon and the bath and analyze its behavior under realistic pulse protocols. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast laser driving can reveal and even induce significant deviations from the commonly adopted Markovian approximation, thereby providing a pathway to probe and control non-Markovian dissipation in driven solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Broken Symmetry Phase of Solid Hydrogen: A Neural Network Variational Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.</description>

      <title>MOF-derived Fe-doped $\delta$-MnO$_2$ nanoflowers as oxidase mimics: Chromogenic sensing of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone in aqueous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure and morphology play a crucial role in enhancing the biomimetic oxidase activity of nanozymes. In this study, a facile \emph{in situ} chemical oxidation strategy was employed to synthesize MOF-derived MnO$_x$, utilizing the structural features of the parent MOF to enhance oxidase-mimicking activity. We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was evaluated using the chromogenic substrate 3,3$'$,5,5$'$-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which produced a blue-colored oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) with an absorption peak at 652~nm upon oxidation. While all Fe-doped MnO$_x$ nanostructures exhibited oxidase-like activity, the 10\% Fe-doped sample (10Fe-MnO$_x$) demonstrated the highest performance, likely due to a synergistic effect of structure, morphology, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The underlying oxidase mechanism was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. In addition, a colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone (HQ) in real water samples collected from industrial and natural sources. The calculated detection limits of the 10Fe-MnO$_x$ colorimetric probe for HQ (1.74~$\mu$M) and Hg$^{2+}$ (0.47~$\mu$M) outperformed those of conventional metal oxide-based nanozymes. These findings pave the way for the development of easily synthesizable, scalable, and highly sensitive oxidase-based MOF-derived metal oxide nanomaterials with significant potential in biological and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Reversible Plasticity in an Amorphous Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local rearrangements are the elements of plastic deformation in an amorphous solid. In oscillatory shear, they can switch reversibly between two distinct configurations. While these repeating relaxations are typically considered in the limit of slow driving, their dynamics is less well understood. We perform experiments on a colloidal amorphous solid at an oil-water interface. The rearrangement timescales we observe span at least 1 decade, with no apparent upper bound. As frequency is increased, individual rearrangements appear faster and more hysteretic, but may disappear entirely above a crossover frequency -- suggesting that in practical experiments, the slowest rearrangements may be latent. We show how to find the effective potential energy that reproduces a particle's frequency-dependent motion. In rare cases, this potential energy has only one minimum. Our results have implications for the energy landscapes and rheology of amorphous or glassy solids, for sound propagation in nonlinear media, and for mechanical memory and history-dependence.</description>

      <title>Lattice Parameters and Bulk Modulus of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ Perovskites: A Comparison of Exchange-Correlation Functionals with Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assessed four exchange-correlation functionals (LDA CA-PZ, GGA parametrized by PBE, PBEsol, and WC) in predicting the lattice parameters of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ perovskites, assuming cubic structures. Predictions were verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for Mn content of $\mathit{x}$ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, confirming cubic symmetry and a linear decrease in lattice parameters with increasing Mn. PBEsol and WC demonstrated the highest precision (deviations &lt; 0.20%). Additionally, bulk moduli were calculated using the same functionals and verified with the experimental bulk modulus of SrTiO$_{3}$ (183 $\pm$ 2 GPa, Pulse-Echo method). The predicted bulk moduli exhibited a slow, linear increase with increasing Mn. The best correspondence with the experimental bulk modulus was achieved by PBEsol and WC (deviations &lt; 0.7%). These findings highlight the reliability of PBEsol and WC functionals for accurately modeling structural properties of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ perovskites, having better precision than commonly employed LDA and PBE functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ is among the most promising lead-free piezoelectrics. While its sputtered films match the performance of the champion piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$, reproducible processing of high-quality and time-stable solution-processed K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films remains challenging. Here, we report 1 $\mu$m-thick Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films prepared through a chemical solution deposition process, which have perfectly dense microstructure and uniform composition across their thickness. The films exhibit a high transverse piezoelectric coefficient ($e_{31,f} = -15.4$ C/m$^2$), high dielectric permittivity ($\varepsilon_r \approx 920$), low dielectric losses ($\tan\delta = 0.05$) and can withstand electric fields up to at least 1 MV/cm. The functional properties show excellent stability over time, and the synthesis process is reproducible. Furthermore, a surface acoustic haptic device is demonstrated by using K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ thin-film actuators. The results demonstrate the high potential of Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films to become a replacement for lead-based Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$ films in piezoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Phonon properties and unconventional heat transfer in quasi-2D $Bi_2O_2Se$ crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$</description>

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the vanadium-based 2D kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, a ferromagnetic material with a magnetic moment of 0.86 $\mu_B$ per atom. Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number $|C| = 1$ and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of $\approx$0.40 eV/{\AA}. These findings position 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic properties of the Ni$_{0.5}$Zn$_{0.5}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (NZF) spinel ferrite ceramics were studied over a broad frequency range (1 MHz - 50 GHz). Between 10 MHz and 2 GHz, strong temperature-dependent resonance-like magnetic permeability dispersion was observed and attributed to the magnetic domain-wall dynamics. It is responsible for the high magnetic losses, absorption and shielding ability of NZF, and provides high nonlinearity and tunability of the permeability under a weak magnetic field. The attenuation constant of NZF is comparable to those of dielectric-conductor composites and giant permittivity materials. In the microwave range (2-50 GHz), three magnetic excitations dependent on a weak magnetic field were revealed and related to magnons. The lowest-frequency magnon (&lt;10 GHz) is attributed to the natural ferromagnetic resonance, two others are excited between 28 and 44 GHz. Interaction of the magnons and magneto-dielectric resonance modes with electromagnetic waves provides high absorption and shielding efficiency in the GHz range, including 5G and 6G communication frequencies.</description>

      <title>Hidden ferromagnetism of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism. Nevertheless, $\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such unconventional antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within the unit cell containing only one magnetic site. We show that such presentation is possible due to special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry constrains the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}| {\bf t} \}$, combining the $180^{\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\bf t}$, connecting two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic site per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and net orbital magnetization, and provide transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between AFM sublattices, as well as the orthorhombic strain, controlling the piezomagnetic response. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples including two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the rutile structure, using for these purposes realistic models derived from first-principles calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in the percolation theory of passivation have shown that chemical short-range order (SRO) affects the aqueous passivation behavior of alloys. However, there has been no systematic exploration to quantify these SRO effects on percolation in practical alloys and the related passivation behavior. In this study, we quantify the effects of SRO on percolation in a binary size-mismatched Cu-Rh alloy and study the related passivation behavior. We develop a mixed-space cluster expansion model trained on the mixing energy calculated using density functional theory. We use the cluster expansion model to sample the configuration space via variance-constrained semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and develop SRO diagrams over a range of compositions and temperatures. Building on this with the percolation crossover model, specifically the variation of percolation threshold with SRO in the FCC lattice, we construct the first nearest-neighbor chemical percolation diagram. These diagrams can inform the design of the next generation of corrosion-resistant metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Automated Machine Learning Pipeline: Large Language Models-Assisted Automated Dataset Generation for Training Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become powerful tools to extend molecular simulations beyond the limits of quantum methods, offering near-quantum accuracy at much lower computational cost. Yet, developing reliable MLIPs remains difficult because it requires generating high-quality datasets, preprocessing atomic structures, and carefully training and validating models. In this work, we introduce an Automated Machine Learning Pipeline (AMLP) that unifies the entire workflow from dataset creation to model validation. AMLP employs large-language-model agents to assist with electronic-structure code selection, input preparation, and output conversion, while its analysis suite (AMLP-Analysis), based on ASE supports a range of molecular simulations. The pipeline is built on the MACE architecture and validated on acridine polymorphs, where, with a straightforward fine-tuning of a foundation model, mean absolute errors of ~1.7 meV/atom in energies and ~7.0 meV/{\AA} in forces are achieved. The fitted MLIP reproduces DFT geometries with sub-{\AA} accuracy and demonstrates stability during molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.</description>

      <title>Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</description>

      <title>Photoemission tomography of excitons in 2D systems: momentum-space signatures of correlated electron-hole wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum-space signatures of excitons can be experimentally accessed through time-resolved (pump-probe) photoelectron spectroscopy. In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the GW +Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the light-matter interaction via the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects, including a dependence of the photoemission angular distribution on the pump pulse polarization. Moreover, our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Isostructural phase transition and equation of state of type-I and type-VIII metallic sodium borosilicide clathrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic properties of silicon-based clathrates can be tuned by boron incorporation into the silicon cage network. Sodium borosilicides clathrate outstands with uncommon stoichiometry and expected metallic properties, in contrast to other alkali metal semiconductive Zintl borosilicides. In this study, we report an experimental investigation of the high-pressure behavior of type-I and type-VIII sodium borosilicide clathrates. An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms from the Si(6c) site. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression. The metallic character was established using reflectance spectroscopy over a wide energy range, in good agreement with crystallographic data on the boron content.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Magnetoresistances in Chiral Tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Quantum Transport Simulations in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonons are essential quasi-particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be interpreted as Goldstone modes that emerge due to the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In this article, we investigate the quantum geometric contribution to the phonon spectrum in the absence of Holstein phonons. Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum, and we find that removing the nontrivial quantum geometric contribution from the dynamical matrix causes the acoustic phonon modes to behave in a non-analytic fashion.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices, where the first magnon gaps are topologically trivial and do not support topological edge states (TESs). In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Field-induced topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them, thereby enabling controlled switching of magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology of noncollinear spin textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <title>"Aftereffects'' phenomenon in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$$^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals: Novel approach integrating experimental double-model analysis with density-functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an experimental double-model analysis, combined with density-functional theory (DFT), to investigate the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) associated with the electron-capture (EC) decay ``aftereffects'' (ECAE) phenomenon. This electronic phenomenon, which is reversible with temperature, is typically observed in TDPAC experiments on oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC) $\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd probe atoms and was recently explained within an \emph{ab initio} framework based on fluctuations in the number of trapped electron holes at ^{111}$Cd [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{105}$, 195201 (2022)]. From now on, it is possible to determine, for each measured temperature and observed HFI, the set of \emph{initial} electronic configurations around the probe nucleus and their associated EFGs, whose fluctuations produce these dynamic HFIs, rather than simply identifying the configuration that generates the stable final EFG when the dynamic process ends. We demonstrate the equivalence between the two most used methods for analyzing this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam \emph{et al.} (BO approach) and Lupascu \emph{et al.} (L approach), successfully connecting the relaxation constant $\lambda$$_r$ (the damping strength of the TDPAC spectra) in the BO approach with the distribution's half-width $\delta$$_i$ of the initial fluctuating EFGs in the L approach. To address this, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed \emph{ab initio} analysis of defect-formation energies, both as a function of the Cd impurity's charge state, to unravel controversial TDPAC results reported for ^{111}$In-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals, now revisited. These results quantitatively confirm the physical scenario underlying both the BO and L approaches, and this new method can also be applied to other TDPAC probes without EC.</description>

      <title>Fermionic dynamics on a trapped-ion quantum computer beyond exact classical simulation</title>

Abstract: Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations of fermions has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</description>

      <title>Programmable digital quantum simulation of 2D Fermi-Hubbard dynamics using 72 superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</description>
