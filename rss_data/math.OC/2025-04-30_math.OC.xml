      <title>Enhancing Flexibility in Smart Manufacturing: System Property Enabled Multiagent Approach for Mobile Robot Scheduling in Multiproduct Flexible Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present volatile global market is marked by a rising need for extensively tailored products. Flourishing in such an environment necessitates fostering a more intimate connection between market requirements and the manufacturing system, with a primary emphasis on the customer. Multiproduct flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) appear to be one of the most suitable manufacturing systems for mass-customization, given their capacity to readily adapt to variations in product specifications and functionalities to meet evolving market demands. Mobile robots play a pivotal role in managing multiproduct FMS. However, scheduling these robots poses a challenging problem due to system internal uncertainties and fluctuations in external demand. This paper proposes a solution to the robots' scheduling problem in a multiproduct FMS with stochastic machine failures and uncertain market demand for different product types. The proposed approach abstracts system properties for FMS and leverages these properties to improve the multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. This modification involves integrating parallel layers into the critic network, focusing specifically on crucial information such as varying customer demands. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted, comparing it with the simple-MADDPG, DDPG, and DQN algorithms. The results of the analysis demonstrate an average improvement of 9% in training time and 19% in market demand satisfaction. Moreover, to ensure scalability, transfer learning is employed, showcasing the applicability of the proposed method in large-scale complex environments.</description>

      <title>Particle Approximation for Conditional Control with Soft Killing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to develop a particle approximation for the conditional control problem introduced by P.-L. Lions during his lectures at the Coll\`ege de France in November 2016. We focus on a \textit{soft killing} relaxed version of the problem, which admits a natural counterpart in terms of stochastic optimal control for a large number of interacting particles. Each particle contributes to the overall population cost through a time-evolving weight that depends on the trajectories of all the other particles. Using recently developed techniques for the analysis of the value function associated with the limiting problem, we establish sharp convergence rates as the number of particles tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic output-based feedback stabilizability for linear parabolic equations with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabilizability of a general class of linear parabolic equations with a memory term, is achieve by explicit output feedback. The control input is given as a function of a state-estimate provided by an exponential dynamic Luenberger observer based on the output of sensor measurements. The numbers of actuators and sensors are finite. The feedback input and output injection operators are given explicitly involving appropriate orthogonal projections. For exponential kernels, exponential stabilizability can be achieved with the rate of the exponential kernel. The discretization and simulation of the controlled systems are addressed as well and results of simulations are reported showing the performance of the proposed dynamic output-based control feedback input. We include simulations for both exponential and weakly singular Riesz kernels, showing the success of the strategy in obtaining a stabilizing input.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Hard Thresholding for Sparse Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many model selection algorithms rely on sparse dictionary learning to provide interpretable and physics-based governing equations. The optimization algorithms typically use a hard thresholding process to enforce sparse activations in the model coefficients by removing library elements from consideration. By introducing an annealing scheme that reactivates a fraction of the removed terms with a cooling schedule, we are able to improve the performance of these sparse learning algorithms. We concentrate on two approaches to the optimization, SINDy, and an alternative using hard thresholding pursuit. We see in both cases that annealing can improve model accuracy. The effectiveness of annealing is demonstrated through comparisons on several nonlinear systems pulled from convective flows, excitable systems, and population dynamics. Finally we apply these algorithms to experimental data for projectile motion.</description>

      <title>Global Optimality Characterizations and Algorithms for Minimizing Quartically-Regularized Third-Order Taylor Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order methods for convex and nonconvex optimization, particularly $p$th-order Adaptive Regularization Methods (AR$p$), have attracted significant research interest by naturally incorporating high-order Taylor models into adaptive regularization frameworks, resulting in algorithms with faster global and local convergence rates than first- and second-order methods. This paper establishes global optimality conditions for general, nonconvex cubic polynomials with quartic regularization. These criteria generalise existing results, recovering the optimality results for regularized quadratic polynomials, and can be further simplified in the low-rank and diagonal tensor cases. Under suitable assumptions on the Taylor polynomial, we derive a lower bound for the regularization parameter such that the necessary and sufficient criteria coincide, establishing a connection between this bound and the subproblem's convexification and sum-of-squares (SoS) convexification techniques. Leveraging the optimality characterization, we develop a Diagonal Tensor Method (DTM) for minimizing quartically-regularized cubic Taylor polynomials by iteratively minimizing a sequence of local models that incorporate both diagonal cubic terms and quartic regularization (DTM model). We show that the DTM algorithm is provably convergent, with a global evaluation complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$. Furthermore, when special structure is present (such as low rank or diagonal), DTM can exactly solve the given problem (in one iteration). In our numerical experiments, we propose practical DTM variants that exploit local problem information for model construction, which we then show to be competitive with cubic regularization and other subproblem solvers, with superior performance on problems with special structure.</description>

      <title>On the Acceleration of Proximal Bundle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proximal bundle method (PBM) is a fundamental and computationally effective algorithm for solving nonsmooth optimization problems. In this paper, we present the first variant of the PBM for smooth objectives, achieving an accelerated convergence rate of $O(\epsilon^{-1/2}\log(1/\epsilon))$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy. Our approach addresses an open question regarding the convergence guarantee of proximal bundle type methods, which was previously posed in two recent papers. We interpret the PBM as a proximal point algorithm and base our proposed algorithm on an accelerated inexact proximal point scheme. Our variant introduces a novel null step test and oracle while maintaining the core structure of the original algorithm. The newly proposed oracle substitutes the traditional cutting planes with a smooth lower approximation of the true function. We show that this smooth interpolating lower model can be computed as a convex quadratic program. We also examine a second setting where Nesterov acceleration can be effectively applied, specifically when the objective is the sum of a smooth function and a piecewise linear one.</description>

      <title>Safe and Optimal N-Spacecraft Swarm Reconfiguration in Non-Keplerian Cislunar Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fuel-optimal guidance and control methodology for spacecraft swarm reconfiguration in Restricted Multi-Body Problems (RMBPs) with a guarantee of passive safety, maintaining miss distance even under abrupt loss of control authority. A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, this can be expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is highly applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in various models of RMBPs (Elliptical Restricted Three-Body Problem and Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem) and also validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts from the two- to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation for the practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.</description>

      <title>Shadow-point Enhanced Inexact Accelerated Proximal Gradient Method with Preserved Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a non-smooth convex function using the inexact accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method. A key limitation of existing approaches is their reliance on feasible approximate solutions to subproblems, which is often computationally expensive or even unrealistic to obtain in practice. To address this limitation, we develop a shadow-point enhanced inexact accelerated proximal gradient method (SpinAPG), which can eliminate the feasibility requirement while preserving all desirable convergence properties of the APG method, including the iterate convergence and an $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rate for the objective function value, under suitable summable-error conditions. Our method also provides a more flexible and computationally efficient inexact framework for the APG method, with a fairly easy-to-implement error criterion. Finally, we demonstrate the practical advantages of our SpinAPG through numerical experiments on a relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem, showcasing its effectiveness while bypassing the explicit computation of a feasible point.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Replication Strategies in Trust-Region-Based Bayesian Optimization of Stochastic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a method for stochastic simulation optimization relying on Gaussian process models within a trust-region framework. We are interested in the case when the variance of the objective function is large. We propose to rely on replication and local modeling to cope with this high-throughput regime, where the number of evaluations may become large to get accurate results while still keeping good performance. We propose several schemes to encourage replication, from the choice of the acquisition function to setup evaluation costs. Compared with existing methods, our results indicate good scaling, in terms of both accuracy (several orders of magnitude better than existing methods) and speed (taking into account evaluation costs).</description>

      <title>Warehouse storage and retrieval optimization via clustering, dynamic systems modeling, and GPU-accelerated routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a warehouse optimization procedure aimed at enhancing the efficiency of product storage and retrieval. By representing product locations and order flows within a time-evolving graph structure, we employ unsupervised clustering to define and refine compact order regions, effectively reducing picking distances. We describe the procedure using a dynamic mathematical model formulated using tools from random dynamical systems theory, enabling a principled analysis of the system's behavior over time even under random operational variations. For routing within this framework, we implement a parallelized Bellman-Ford algorithm, utilizing GPU acceleration to evaluate path segments efficiently. To address scalability challenges inherent in large routing graphs, we introduce a segmentation strategy that preserves performance while maintaining tractable memory requirements. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both operational efficiency and computational feasibility for large-scale warehouse environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of general nonlinear discrete-time stochastic systems controlled by optimal inputs that minimize an infinite-horizon discounted cost. Under a novel stochastic formulation of cost-controllability and detectability assumptions inspired by the related literature on deterministic systems, we prove that uniform semi-global practical recurrence holds for the closed-loop system, where the adjustable parameter is the discount factor. Under additional continuity assumptions, we further prove that this property is robust.</description>

      <title>Charge Schedule Optimization and Infrastructure Planning for Solar-Integrated Electric Bus Transit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urban transit systems transition towards electrification, using renewable energy sources (RES), such as solar, is essential to make them efficient and sustainable. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses a challenge in deciding the solar panel requirements and battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity at charging locations. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming model that considers seasonality in solar energy generation while incorporating temperature-based variations in bus energy consumption and dynamic time-of-use electricity prices. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a multi-scenario linear program (LP) where the first-stage long-term variables determine the charging station power capacity, BESS capacity, and the solar panel area at each charging location. The second-stage scenario-specific variables prescribe the energy transferred to buses directly from the grid or the BESS during layovers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework using data from Durham Transit Network (Ontario) and Action Buses (Canberra), where bus schedules and charging locations are determined using a concurrent scheduler-based heuristic. Solar energy data is collected from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) database. We solved the multi-scenario LP using Benders' decomposition, which performed better than the dual simplex method, especially when the number of scenarios was high. With solar energy production at the depots, our model estimated a cost savings of 16.48% and 32.00% for the Durham and Canberra networks, respectively. Our results also show that the scenario-based schedule adapts better to seasonal variations than a schedule estimated from average input parameters.</description>

      <title>Region of Synchronization Estimation for Complex Networks via SOS Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the problem of the region of synchronization (ROS) for complex networks with nonlinear dynamics. Given a pair of state- and target- sets, our goal is to estimate the ROS such that the trajectories originating within it reach the target set (i.e., synchronization manifold), without leaving the state set before the first hitting time. In order to do so, an exponential guidance-barrier function is proposed to construct the ROS along the synchronization manifold, and the corresponding sufficient conditions for estimating the ROS are developed. The resulting conditions lead to a sum-of-squares programming problem, thereby affording a polynomial-time solvability. Furthermore, when the synchronization manifold reduces to an equilibrium point, our method not only estimates a larger ROS compared to existing results but also allows the ROS to take more general shapes. Finally, we present two numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Teacher-Student MPC-PPO Coupled Reinforcement Learning Framework for Winter Temperature Control of Solar Greenhouses in Northern China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar greenhouses are crucial infrastructure of modern agricultural production in northern China. However, highly fluctuating temperature in winter season results in poor greenhouse temperature control, which affects crop growth and increases energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, an advanced control system that can efficiently optimize multiple objectives under dramatic climate conditions is essential. Therefore, this study propose a model predictive control-coupled proximal policy optimization (MPC-PPO) control framework. A teacher-student control framework is constructed in which the MPC generating high-quality control experiences to guide the PPO agent's learning process. An adaptive dynamic weighting mechanism is employed to balance the influence of MPC experiences during PPO training. Evaluation conducted in solar greenhouses across three provinces in northern China (Beijing, Hebei, and Shandong) demonstrates that: (1) the MPC-PPO method achieved the highest temperature control performance (96.31 on a 100-point scale), with a 5.46-point improvement compared to the non-experience integration baseline, when reduced standard deviation by nearly half and enhanced exploration efficiency; (2) the MPC-PPO method achieved a ventilation control reward of 99.19, optimizing ventilation window operations with intelligent time-differentiated strategies that reduced energy loss during non-optimal hours; (3) feature analysis reveals that historical window opening, air temperature, and historical temperature are the most influential features for effective control, i.e., SHAP values of 7.449, 4.905, and 4.747 respectively; and (4) cross-regional tests indicated that MPC-PPO performs best in all test regions, confirming generalization of the method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chance-Constrained Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (CC-PMSP) assigns jobs with uncertain processing times to machines, ensuring that each machine's availability constraints are met with a certain probability. We present a decomposition approach where the master problem assigns jobs to machines, and the subproblems schedule the jobs on each machine while verifying the solution's feasibility under the chance constraint. We propose two different Decision Diagram (DD) formulations to solve the subproblems and generate cuts. The first formulation employs DDs with a linear cost function, while the second uses a non-linear cost function to reduce the diagram's size. We show how to generate no-good and irreducible infeasible subsystem (IIS) cuts based on our DDs. Additionally, we extend the cuts proposed by Lozano &amp; Smith (2018) to solve two-stage stochastic programming models. Our DD-based methodology outperforms traditional integer programming (IP) models designed to solve the CC-PMSP in several instances. Specifically, our best DD-based approach solves 55 more instances than the best IP alternative (from a total of 405) and typically achieves smaller gaps (50% vs. 120% gap on average).</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Second-Order Optimizers in Deep Learning: Insights from Fisher Information Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order optimization methods remain the standard for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by preconditioning the stochastic gradient with a diagonal matrix. Despite the widespread adoption of first-order methods, second-order optimization algorithms often exhibit superior convergence compared to methods like Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited by a significantly higher per-iteration computational cost compared to first-order methods. In this thesis, we present AdaFisher, a novel adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix to adaptively precondition gradients. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between the improved convergence and generalization of second-order methods and the computational efficiency needed for training DNNs. Despite the traditionally slower speed of second-order optimizers, AdaFisher is effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling, exhibiting remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in both accuracy and convergence speed. The code is available from https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/AdaFisher.</description>

      <title>A state reduction approach for learning-based model predictive control for train rescheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a state reduction method for learning-based model predictive control (MPC) for train rescheduling in urban rail transit systems. The state reduction integrates into a control framework where the discrete decision variables are determined by a learning-based classifier and the continuous decision variables are computed by MPC. Herein, the state representation is designed separately for each component of the control framework. While a reduced state is employed for learning, a full state is used in MPC. Simulations on a large-scale train network highlight the effectiveness of the state reduction mechanism in improving the performance and reducing the memory usage.</description>

      <title>Computation of Capacity-Distortion-Cost Functions for Continuous Memoryless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at computing the capacity-distortion-cost (CDC) function for continuous memoryless channels, which is defined as the supremum of the mutual information between channel input and output, constrained by an input cost and an expected distortion of estimating channel state. Solving the optimization problem is challenging because the input distribution does not lie in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and the optimal estimation function has no closed form in general. We propose to adopt the Wasserstein proximal point method and parametric models such as neural networks (NNs) to update the input distribution and estimation function alternately. To implement it in practice, the importance sampling (IS) technique is used to calculate integrals numerically, and the Wasserstein gradient descent is approximated by pushing forward particles. The algorithm is then applied to an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, validating theoretical results at minimum and maximum distortion as well as the random-deterministic trade-off.</description>

      <title>Can Nash inform capital requirements? Allocating systemic risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic risk measures aggregate the risks from multiple financial institutions to find system-wide capital requirements. Though much attention has been given to assessing the level of systemic risk, less has been given to allocating that risk to the constituent institutions. Within this work, we propose a Nash allocation rule that is inspired by game theory. Intuitively, to construct these capital allocations, the banks compete in a game to reduce their own capital requirements while, simultaneously, maintaining system-level acceptability. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Nash allocation rules, and apply our results to the prominent structures used for systemic risk measures in the literature. We demonstrate the efficacy of Nash allocations with numerical case studies using the Eisenberg-Noe aggregation mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We consider Borwein-Preiss and Ekeland variational principles using distance functions that neither is symmetric nor enjoy the triangular inequality. All the given results rely exclusively on the convergence and continuity behaviors induced synthetically by the distance function itself without any topological implications.

      <title>Breaking the Barrier of Self-Concordant Barriers: Faster Interior Point Methods for M-Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two fundamental optimization problems: (1) scaling a symmetric positive definite matrix by a positive diagonal matrix so that the resulting matrix has row and column sums equal to 1; and (2) minimizing a quadratic function subject to hard non-negativity constraints. Both problems lend themselves to efficient algorithms based on interior point methods (IPMs). For general instances, standard self-concordance theory places a limit on the iteration complexity of these methods at $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{1/2}\right)$, where $n$ denotes the matrix dimension. We show via an amortized analysis that, when the input matrix is an M-matrix, an IPM with adaptive step sizes solves both problems in only $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{1/3}\right)$ iterations. As a corollary, using fast Laplacian solvers, we obtain an $\ell_{2}$ flow diffusion algorithm with depth $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{1/3}\right)$ and work $\widetilde{O}$$\left(n^{1/3}\cdot\text{nnz}\right)$. This result marks a significant instance in which a standard log-barrier IPM permits provably fewer than $\Theta\left(n^{1/2}\right)$ iterations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a natural generalization of Euclidean projection through the lens of strongly quasiconvex functions, as developed in prior works. By establishing a connection between strongly quasiconvex functions and the theory of mutually polar mappings on convex cones, we integrate this generalized projection concept into the duality framework of Riesz spaces, vector norms, and Euclidean metric projections. A central result of this study is the identification of conditions under which the null space of a projection onto a closed convex cone forms a closed convex cone. We provide a comprehensive characterization of such cones and projections, highlighting their fundamental role in extending the duality theory to generalized projection operators.</description>

      <title>Exploiting inter-agent coupling information for efficient reinforcement learning of cooperative LQR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing scalable and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for cooperative multi-agent control has received significant attention over the past years. Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and computational efficiency on numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the setting of Markov decision processes for a large number of exchangeable agents interacting in a mean field manner. Applications include, for example, the control of a large number of robots communicating through a central unit dispatching the optimal policy computed by maximizing an aggregate reward. An approximate solution is obtained by learning the optimal policy of a generic agent interacting with the statistical distribution of the states and actions of the other agents. We first provide a full analysis this discrete-time mean field control problem. We then rigorously prove the convergence of exact and model-free policy gradient methods in a mean-field linear-quadratic setting and establish bounds on the rates of convergence. We also provide graphical evidence of the convergence based on implementations of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton: Accelerating Finite-Sum Minimization with Large Batches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic variance reduction has proven effective at accelerating first-order algorithms for solving convex finite-sum optimization tasks such as empirical risk minimization. Incorporating second-order information has proven helpful in further improving the performance of these first-order methods. Yet, comparatively little is known about the benefits of using variance reduction to accelerate popular stochastic second-order methods such as Subsampled Newton. To address this, we propose Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton (SVRN), a finite-sum minimization algorithm that provably accelerates existing stochastic Newton methods from $O(\alpha\log(1/\epsilon))$ to $O\big(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log(n)}\big)$ passes over the data, i.e., by a factor of $O(\alpha\log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of sum components and $\alpha$ is the approximation factor in the Hessian estimate. Surprisingly, this acceleration gets more significant the larger the data size $n$, which is a unique property of SVRN. Our algorithm retains the key advantages of Newton-type methods, such as easily parallelizable large-batch operations and a simple unit step size. We use SVRN to accelerate Subsampled Newton and Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithms, and show that it compares favorably to popular first-order methods with variance~reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02727v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper concerns foundations of sensitivity and stability analysis in optimization and related areas, being primarily addressed truncated constrained systems. We consider general models, which are described by multifunctions between Banach spaces and concentrate on characterizing their well-posedness properties that revolve around Lipschitz stability and metric regularity relative to sets. Invoking tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation, we introduce new robust notions of relative contingent coderivatives. The novel machinery of variational analysis leads us to establishing complete characterizations of such properties and developing basic rules of variational calculus interrelated with the obtained characterizations of well-posedness. Most of the our results valid in general infinite-dimensional settings are also new in finite dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a manifold optimization approach to solve linear semidefinite programs (SDP) with low-rank solutions, with an emphasis on SDP relaxations for polynomial optimization problems. This approach incorporates the inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and the Burer-Monteiro factorization, and features the self-adaptive strategies for updating the factorization size and the penalty parameter. We establish global convergence of the inexact ALM, despite the non-convexity brought by the Burer-Monteiro factorization. We further provide a practical algorithm building on the inexact ALM, and along with the algorithm we release an open-source SDP solver ManiSDP. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that ManiSDP achieves state-of-the-art in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, and is faster than several advanced SDP solvers (MOSEK, SDPLR, SDPNAL+, STRIDE) by up to orders of magnitudes on a variety of linear SDPs. The largest SDP solved by ManiSDP (in about 8.5 hours with maximal KKT residue 3.5e-13) is the second-order moment relaxation of a binary quadratic program with 120 variables, which has matrix dimension 7261 and contains 17,869,161 affine constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, deep learning became the prevalent methodology for predictive modeling thanks to the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. Meanwhile, the structure of neural networks converged back to simpler representations based on piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which became the most commonly used type of activation function in neural networks. That made certain types of network structure $\unicode{x2014}$such as the typical fully-connected feedforward neural network$\unicode{x2014}$ amenable to analysis through polyhedral theory and to the application of methodologies such as Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for a variety of purposes. In this paper, we survey the main topics emerging from this fast-paced area of work, which bring a fresh perspective to understanding neural networks in more detail as well as to applying linear optimization techniques to train, verify, and reduce the size of such networks.</description>

      <title>Cooperation, Correlation and Competition in Ergodic N-player Games and Mean-field Games of Singular Controls: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of $N$-player games and mean-field games of singular controls with ergodic performance criterion, providing a benchmark case for irreversible investment games featuring mean-field interaction and strategic complementarities. The state of each player follows a geometric Brownian motion, controlled additively through a nondecreasing process, while agents seek to maximize a long-term average reward functional with a power-type instantaneous profit, under strategic complementarity. We explore three different notions of optimality, which, in the mean-field limit, correspond to the mean-field control solution, mean-field coarse correlated equilibria, and mean-field Nash equilibria. We explicitly compute equilibria in the three cases and compare them numerically, in terms of yielded payoffs and existence conditions. Finally, we show that the mean-field control and mean-field equilibria can approximate the cooperative and competitive equilibria, respectively, in the corresponding $N$-player game when $N$ is sufficiently large. Our analysis of the mean-field control problem features a novel Lagrange multiplier approach, which proves crucial in establishing the approximation result, while the treatment of mean-field coarse correlated equilibria necessitates a new, specifically tailored definition for the stationary setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problems, which require only a weaker restricted $L$-smooth adaptable property on the smooth part of the objective function, instead of the standard global Lipschitz gradient continuity assumption. Such problems are prevalent in many contemporary applications such as compressed sensing, statistical regression, and machine learning, and can be solved by a general Bregman proximal DC algorithm (BPDCA). However, the existing BPDCA is developed based on the stringent requirement that the involved subproblems must be solved exactly, which is often impractical and limits the applicability of the BPDCA. To facilitate the practical implementations and wider applications of the BPDCA, we develop an inexact Bregman proximal difference-of-convex algorithm (iBPDCA) by incorporating two types of relative-type stopping criteria for solving the subproblems. The proposed inexact framework has considerable flexibility to encompass many existing exact and inexact methods, and can accommodate different types of errors that may occur when solving the subproblem. This enables the potential application of our inexact framework across different DC decompositions to facilitate the design of a more efficient DCA scheme in practice. The global subsequential convergence and the global sequential convergence of our iBPDCA are established under suitable conditions including the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property. Some numerical experiments are conducted to show the superior performance of our iBPDCA in comparison to existing algorithms. These results also empirically validate the necessity and significance of developing different types of stopping criteria to facilitate the efficient computation of the subproblem in each iteration of our iBPDCA.</description>

      <title>Accessible Theoretical Complexity of the Restarted Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Linear Programs with Unique Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method (rPDHG) has recently emerged as an important tool for solving large-scale linear programs (LPs). For LPs with unique optima, we present an iteration bound of $\widetilde{O}\left(\kappa\Phi\cdot\ln\left(\frac{\|w^*\|}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target tolerance, $\kappa$ is the standard matrix condition number, $\|w^*\|$ is the norm of the optimal solution, and $\Phi$ is a geometric condition number of the LP sublevel sets. This iteration bound is "accessible" in the sense that computing it is no more difficult than computing the optimal solution itself. Indeed, we present a closed-form and tractably computable expression for $\Phi$. This enables an analysis of the "two-stage performance" of rPDHG: we show that the first stage identifies the optimal basis in $\widetilde{O}\left(\kappa\Phi\right)$ iterations, and the second stage computes an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution in $O\left(\|B^{-1}\|\|A\|\cdot\ln\left(\frac{\xi}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)$ additional iterations, where $A$ is the constraint matrix, $B$ is the optimal basis and $\xi$ is the smallest nonzero in the optimal solution. Furthermore, computational tests mostly confirm the tightness of our iterations bounds. We also show a reciprocal relation between the iteration bound and three equivalent types of condition measures: (i) stability under data perturbation, (ii) proximity to multiple optima, and (iii) the LP sharpness of the instance. Finally, we analyze an "optimized" primal-dual reweighting which offers some intuition concerning the step-size heuristics used in practice.</description>

      <title>On invariance of observability for BSDEs and its applications to stochastic control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21863v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the invariance of observability for the observed backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with constant coefficients, relative to the filtered probability space. This signifies that the observability of these observed BSDEs with constant coefficients remains unaffected by the selection of the filtered probability space. As an illustrative application, we demonstrate that for stochastic control systems with constant coefficients, weak observability, approximate null controllability with cost, and stabilizability are equivalent across some or any filtered probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) studies decision problems under uncertainty where the probability distribution governing the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain. A key component of any DRO model is its ambiguity set, that is, a family of probability distributions consistent with any available structural or statistical information. DRO seeks decisions that perform best under the worst distribution in the ambiguity set. This worst case criterion is supported by findings in psychology and neuroscience, which indicate that many decision-makers have a low tolerance for distributional ambiguity. DRO is rooted in statistics, operations research and control theory, and recent research has uncovered its deep connections to regularization techniques and adversarial training in machine learning. This survey presents the key findings of the field in a unified and self-contained manner.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Data-enabled Predictive Control: Incorporating model knowledge into the DeePC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive control can either be data-based (e.g. data-enabled predictive control, or DeePC) or model-based (model predictive control). In this paper we aim to bridge the gap between the two by investigating the case where only a partial model is available, i.e. incorporating model knowledge into DeePC. This has potential advantages over a purely data-based approach in terms of noise and computational expense in some cases, as well as applications to certain linear time-varying and nonlinear systems. We formulate an approach to take advantage of partial model knowledge which we call hybrid data-enabled predictive control (HDeePC) and prove feasible set equivalence and equivalent closed-loop behavior in the noiseless, LTI case. Finally, two examples illustrate the potential of HDeePC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a vector linear programming formulation for a non-stationary, finite-horizon Markov decision process with vector-valued rewards. Pareto efficient policies are shown to correspond to efficient solutions of the linear program, and vector linear programming theory allows us to fully characterize deterministic efficient policies. An algorithm for enumerating all efficient deterministic policies is presented then tested numerically in an engineering application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss how a general bilinear finite-dimensional closed quantum system with dispersed parameters can be steered between eigenstates. We show that, under suitable conditions on the separation of spectral gaps and the boundedness of parameter dispersion, rotating wave and adiabatic approximations can be employed in cascade to achieve population inversion between arbitrary eigenstates. We propose an explicit control law and test numerically the sharpness of the conditions on several examples.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions for Polynomial Systems Based on Sum-of-Squares Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) are commonly utilized in the literature as a powerful tool for synthesizing control policies that guarantee safety of discrete-time dynamical systems. However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Trading off regional and overall energy system design flexibility in the net-zero transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and EU-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. We use an optimisation model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focussing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions, and land use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in Southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall. These results on regional trade-offs facilitate more meaningful policy discussions which are crucial in the transition to a sustainable energy system.</description>

      <title>Common pitfalls to avoid while using multiobjective optimization in machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML). This interest is driven by the numerous real-life situations where multiple objectives must be optimized simultaneously. A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which represents the optimal trade-offs between different objectives. Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature serving as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners aiming to apply MOO effectively. In this paper, our goal is to provide such a resource and highlight pitfalls to avoid. We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more advanced techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA). We critically review existing studies across various ML fields where MOO has been applied and identify challenges that can lead to incorrect interpretations. One of these fields is physics informed neural networks (PINNs), which we use as a guiding example to carefully construct experiments illustrating these pitfalls. By comparing WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II, we demonstrate that difficulties can arise regardless of the specific MOO method used. We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence criteria can result in misleading experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Scientific Method: The Role of Hypotheses and Involved Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper investigates the role of data, hypotheses and mathematical methods that can be used in the discovery of a law y=fo(u), relating variables u and y of a physical phenomenon, making use of experimental measurements of such variables. Since the exact knowledge of the function fo cannot be expected, the problem of deriving approximate functions giving a small approximation error, measured by some function norm, is discussed. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. At first, it is proven that deriving a reliable approximation, i.e., having a finite error, is not possible using measured data only. Thus, for deriving a reliable approximation, hypotheses on the function fo and on the disturbances corrupting the measurements must be introduced. Second, necessary and sufficient conditions for deriving a reliable approximation are provided. If such conditions are satisfied, suitable accuracy properties of the approximation can be defined, called theoretical properties. Third, it is shown that it is not possible to verify the conditions necessary for deriving a reliable approximation, but it is possible to verify that hypotheses on fo and on the disturbances are falsified by experimental measurements, showing that no function and disturbances satisfying the given hypotheses exist, able to reproduce the measurements (this is called falsification property). The above properties are then discussed for hypotheses belonging to the following classes: Parametric Probabilistic, where fo is assumed to be a function depending on a vector p and the disturbances are assumed to be stochastic variables; Set Membership class, where fo is assumed to be a bounded smooth function and the disturbances are assumed to be bounded variables; Parametric Set Membership class, able to integrate Parametric Probabilistic hypotheses with Set Membership hypotheses.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of planar graphs. Atserias et al. [JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general. The NPA hierarchy gives a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations of quantum isomorphism. Recently, Roberson and Seppelt [ICALP'23] obtained a homomorphism indistinguishability characterization of the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism. We prove a quantum analogue of this result by showing that each level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism of graphs is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over an appropriate class of planar graphs. By combining the convergence of the NPA hierarchy with the fact that the union of these graph classes is the set of all planar graphs, we are able to give a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] that avoids the use of the theory of quantum groups. This homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also allows us to give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Optimal In-Network Distribution of Learning Functions for a Secure-by-Design Programmable Data Plane of Next-Generation Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of programmable data plane (PDP) and in-network computing (INC) paradigms paves the way for the development of network devices (switches, network interface cards, etc.) capable of performing advanced processing tasks. This allows running various types of algorithms, including machine learning, within the network itself to support user and network services. In particular, this paper delves into the deployment of in-network learning models with the aim of implementing fully distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Specifically, a model is proposed for the optimal distribution of the IDS/IPS workload among data plane devices with the aim of ensuring complete network security without excessively burdening the normal operations of the devices. Furthermore, a meta-heuristic approach is proposed to reduce the long computation time required by the exact solution provided by the mathematical model and its performance is evaluated. The analysis conducted and the results obtained demonstrate the enormous potential of the proposed new approach for the creation of intelligent data planes that act effectively and autonomously as the first line of defense against cyber attacks, with minimal additional workload on the network devices involved.</description>
