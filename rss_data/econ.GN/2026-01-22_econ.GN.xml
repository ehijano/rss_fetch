      <title>Economics of Douglas fir management revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent Douglas fir management investigation is repeated in terms of accounting measures. The rotation times become much shorter than in earlier results. Thinnings do not become feasible, provided the thinning effects on the volumetric yield function do not evolve in time. Evolving prices and expenses break the periodic boundary condition in monetary quantities: profit rates and capitalizations evolve with prices. The periodic boundary condition is, however, retained in time derivatives of dimensionless quantities, as well as in physical characteristics of rotations optimized for the rate of return. Then, optimal rotations do not depend on the evolution of prices and expenses. Relatively high timber prices shorten rotations, as relatively high expenses extend them.</description>

      <title>How Wasteful is Signaling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signaling is wasteful. But how wasteful? We study the fraction of surplus dissipated in a separating equilibrium. For isoelastic environments, this waste ratio has a simple formula: $\beta/(\beta+\sigma)$, where $\beta$ is the benefit elasticity (reward to higher perception) and $\sigma$ is the elasticity of higher types' relative cost advantage. The ratio is constant across types and independent of other parameters, including convexity of cost in the signal. A constant waste ratio characterizes the isoelastic class. In winner-take-all signaling tournaments with $N$ candidates, exactly $(N-1)/N$ of the surplus dissipates -- the same as in Tullock contests.</description>

      <title>I Choose For You: an Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether risk and time preferences differ when individuals make decisions for others compared to making decisions for themselves. We introduce a novel ``skin in the game'' experimental design, where choices for others incur a direct cost to the decision-maker, ensuring a genuine trade-off between self-interest and surrogate allocation. The modal outcome is that participants are more risk-averse and impatient when choosing for others than for themselves. Our methodology reveals significant heterogeneity, successfully identifying selfish types often missed by the more standard ``no skin in the game'' approaches. The message is nuanced, as even non-selfish participants behave differently when they have skin in the game. Furthermore, our framework yields more consistent behavior and superior out-of-sample predictive power.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Stakeholder Involvement in Nuclear Power Plant Cost Overruns and Implications for Contract Structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework to model cost overruns associated with four key stakeholders in nuclear power plant construction: equipment suppliers, construction subcontractors, the design and management team, and creditors. The framework estimates the share of overruns caused by each stakeholder and the share of overruns they receive as payment. The results show that the share of cost overruns a given stakeholder causes and the share of overruns they receive as payment are often starkly different, which can lead to profit misallocations and litigation between parties, further exacerbating overruns. The magnitude of these potential profit misallocations is examined under three common contract structures - fixed-price, cost-plus, and performance-based - revealing the advantages and disadvantages of each framework for aligning stakeholder incentives. Regardless of the contract type chosen, strong owner involvement is crucial for project success, and the study concludes with specific recommendations for project owners seeking to minimize cost overruns.</description>

      <title>How the Shale Revolution is Shaping the Future of the Oil and Gas Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shale revolution, driven by advances in horizontal drilling, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, and cyclic gas injection, has reshaped the oil and gas industry over the past two decades. In the United States, these technologies transformed ultra-low permeability shale formations into commercially viable resources, increasing crude oil production from 5 million bpd in 2008 to more than 12 million by 2019. Horizontal drilling became the standard after 2010, with nearly 200,000 horizontal wells completed by the end of 2023, accounting for more than 80% of all new wells in the US. This success is now being replicated in Argentina making the country a leading unconventional producer. The common driver in both cases is the mass manufacturing approach, which industrializes oil production through standardized well designs, repeatable workflows, multi-well pad drilling, and continuous process optimization. Supported by a competitive oilfield service market and a skilled technical workforce, this model has reduced drilling times from months to weeks and cut well costs by half over the past decade. New technologies such as precision geosteering, advanced completion designs, real-time drilling analytics, and cyclic gas injection continue to improve efficiency and productivity. Applying these methods and technologies to conventional reservoirs could significantly expand global production capacity and place sustained downward pressure on crude oil prices. This paper argues that in a period of slowing economic growth and potential financial deleveraging, abundant supply from both unconventional and conventional developments could extend a prolonged phase of relatively low oil prices. Such a scenario would have far-reaching implications for energy policy, investment strategies, and the competitive position of oil-producing nations.</description>

      <title>Dirac's Dilemma of the Economy of Inheritance: Parental Care, Equality of Opportunity, and Managed Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a brief reflection on the principles of human society, P. A. M. Dirac articulated a structural tension between two widely affirmed norms: that it is good and natural for parents to improve the prospects of their own children, and that justice requires that all children have equal opportunities in life. These principles, each compelling on its own, cannot be fully realized together. This paper reconstructs Dirac's dilemma, connects it to the dynamics of compounding advantage and inheritance, and situates it within the broader history of political philosophy, including the work of Rawls, Dworkin, Cohen, Brighouse and Swift, Nozick, Murphy and Nagel, and others. The paper argues that attempts to eliminate the resulting injustices entirely risk damaging the non--zero--sum structures that generate general prosperity, and defends a position of "managed inequality": a robust social floor and real mobility, combined with limits on extreme dynastic accumulation and an explicit acceptance of some residual, but constrained, inherited advantage.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Barrier: Quantifying Artificial Frictional Unemployment in Automated Recruitment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United States labor market exhibits a persistent coexistence of high job vacancy rates and prolonged unemployment duration, a pattern that standard labor market theory struggles to explain. This paper argues that a non-trivial portion of contemporary frictional unemployment is artificially induced by automated recruitment systems that rely on deterministic keyword-based screening.
  Drawing on labor economics, information asymmetry theory, and prior work on algorithmic hiring, we formalize this phenomenon as artificial frictional unemployment arising from semantic misinterpretation of candidate competencies. We evaluate this claim using controlled simulations that compare legacy keyword-based screening with semantic matching based on high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions.
  The results demonstrate substantial improvements in recall and overall matching efficiency without a corresponding loss in precision. Building on these findings, the paper proposes a candidate-side workforce operating architecture that standardizes, verifies, and semantically aligns human capital signals while remaining interoperable with existing recruitment infrastructure. The findings highlight the economic costs of outdated hiring systems and the potential gains from improving semantic alignment in labor market matching.</description>

      <title>Real-time Facial Communication Restores Cooperation After Defection in Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial expressions are central to human interaction, yet their role in strategic decision-making has received limited attention. We investigate how real-time facial communication influences cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. In a laboratory experiment, participants play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under two conditions: in one, they observe their counterpart's facial expressions via gender-neutral avatars, and in the other no facial cues are available. Using state-of-the-art biometric technology to capture and display emotions in real-time, we find that facial communication significantly increases overall cooperation and, notably, promotes cooperation following defection. This restorative effect suggests that facial expressions help participants interpret defections less harshly, fostering forgiveness and the resumption of cooperation. While past actions remain the strongest predictor of behavior, our findings highlight the communicative power of facial expressions in shaping strategic outcomes. These results offer practical insights for designing emotionally responsive virtual agents and digital platforms that sustain cooperation in the absence of physical presence.</description>

Abstract: Political polarization can be beneficial to competing political parties. I study how electoral competition itself generates incentives to polarize voters, even when parties are ex ante identical and motivated purely by political power, interpreted as office rents or influence. I develop a probabilistic voting model with aggregate popularity shocks in which parties have decreasing marginal utility from political power. Equilibrium policy convergence fails. Platform differentiation provides insurance against electoral volatility by securing loyal voter bases and stabilizing political power. In a unidimensional policy space, parties' equilibrium payoffs rise as voters on opposite sides of the median become more extreme, including when polarization is driven by changes in the opponent's supporters. In a multidimensional setting, parties benefit from ideological coherence, the alignment of disagreements across issues. The results have implications for polarizing political communication, party identity, and electoral institutions.</description>

Abstract: This article examines the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall in the Spanish economy between 1960 and 2024, considering the organic composition of capital and the rate of surplus value as central variables. Its aim is to determine whether this law, formulated by Marx in Capital (Vol. III), continues to operate in the contemporary context. The methodology consists of transforming orthodox macroeconomic categories derived from the Spanish National Accounts (CNE), available in BDMACRO, into Marxist variables: constant capital ($c$), variable capital ($v$), and surplus value ($pv$). Based on these, historical series of the organic composition of capital ($q$), the rate of surplus value ($pv'$), and the rate of profit ($g'$) are constructed, adjusted to constant prices to ensure temporal coherence and comparability. The results show a sustained increase in $q$ and a slight decrease in $pv'$, generating a tendential decline in $g'$ with cyclical fluctuations associated with specific crises. The conclusions empirically confirm the validity of the law in Spain, highlighting the historical limits of capitalism and providing quantitative evidence on the structural dynamics of profitability.</description>

      <title>Forecasting financial distress in dynamic environments AI adoption signals and temporally pruned training windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting corporate financial distress increasingly requires capturing firms' adoption of transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, yet model performance remains vulnerable to temporal distribution shifts as these technologies diffuse. This study investigates whether firm-level artificial intelligence (AI) adoption proxies improve forecasting performance beyond standard accounting fundamentals. Using a panel of Chinese A-share non-financial firms from 2007 to 2023, we construct AI indicators from textual disclosures and patent data. We benchmark six machine learning classifiers under a strictly chronological design that fixes the final test year and progressively prunes the training history to capture temporal change. Results indicate that AI proxies consistently improve out-of-sample discrimination and reduce Type II errors, with the strongest gains in tree-based ensembles. Predictive performance is non-monotonic in training window length; models trained on recent data outperform those using full history, while single-year training proves unreliable. Explainability analyses reveal financial ratios as primary drivers, with AI adoption signals adding incremental forecasting content whose interpretation as a risk factor varies across training regimes. Our findings establish AI proxies as valuable predictors for distress screening and demonstrate that adaptive, temporally pruned forecasting windows are essential for robust early warning models in rapidly evolving technological and economic environments.</description>

      <title>Hot Days, Unsafe Schools? The Impact of Heat on School Shootings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using data on school shooting incidents in U.S. K--12 schools from 1981 to 2022, we estimate the causal effects of high temperatures on school shootings and assess the implications of climate change. We find that days with maximum temperatures exceeding 90$^\circ$F lead to a 80\% increase in school shootings relative to days below 70$^\circ$F. Consistent with theories linking heat exposure to aggression, high temperatures increase homicidal and threat-related shootings but have no effect on accidental or suicidal shootings. Heat-induced shootings occur disproportionately during periods of greater student mobility and reduced supervision, including before and after school hours and lunch periods. Higher temperatures increase shootings involving both student and non-student perpetrators. We project that climate change will increase homicidal and threat-related school shootings in the U.S. by 8\% under SSP2--4.5 (moderate emissions) and by 14\% under SSP5--8.5 (high emissions) by 2091--2100, corresponding to approximately 23 and 39 additional shootings per decade, respectively. The present discounted value of the resulting social costs is \$343 million and \$592 million (2025 dollars), respectively.</description>

      <title>BlockingPy: approximate nearest neighbours for blocking of records for entity resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity resolution (probabilistic record linkage, deduplication) is a key step in scientific analysis and data science pipelines involving multiple data sources. The objective of entity resolution is to link records without common unique identifiers that refer to the same entity (e.g., person, company). However, without identifiers, researchers need to specify which records to compare in order to calculate matching probability and reduce computational complexity. One solution is to deterministically block records based on some common variables, such as names, dates of birth or sex or use phonetic algorithms. However, this approach assumes that these variables are free of errors and completely observed, which is often not the case. To address this challenge, we have developed a Python package, BlockingPy, which uses blocking using modern approximate nearest neighbour search and graph algorithms to reduce the number of comparisons. The package supports both CPU and GPU execution. In this paper, we present the design of the package, its functionalities and two case studies related to official statistics. The presented software will be useful for researchers interested in linking data from various sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce BallotRank, a ranked preference aggregation method derived from a modified PageRank algorithm. It is a Condorcet-consistent method without damping, and empirical examination of nearly 2,000 ranked choice elections and over 20,000 internet polls confirms that BallotRank always identifies the Condorcet winner at conventional values of the damping parameter. We also prove that the method satisfies many of the same social choice criteria as other well-known Condorcet completion methods, but it has the advantage of being a natural social welfare function that provides a full ranking of the candidates.</description>
