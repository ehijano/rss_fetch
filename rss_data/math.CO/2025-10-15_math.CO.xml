      <title>Path decompositions of Eulerian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallai's conjecture asserts that every connected graph on $n$ vertices can be decomposed into $\frac{n+1}{2}$ paths. For general graphs (possibly disconnected), it was proved that every graph on $n$ vertices can be decomposed into $\frac{2n}{3}$ paths. This is also best possible (consider the graphs consisting of vertex-disjoint triangles). Lov\'{a}sz showed that every $n$-vertex graph with at most one vertex of even degree can be decomposed into $\frac{n}{2}$ paths. However, Gallai's conjecture is difficult for graphs with many vertices of even degrees. Favaron and Kouider verified Gallai's conjecture for all Eulerian graphs with maximum degree at most $4$. In this paper, we show if $G$ is an Eulerian graph on $n \ge 4$ vertices and the distance between any two triangles in $G$ is at least $3$, then $G$ can be decomposed into at most $\frac{3n}{5}$ paths.</description>

      <title>The structure of subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a subset of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension at most $k$ is well approximated by a union of atoms of a quadratic factor of complexity $(\ell,q)$ (denoting the complexities of the linear and quadratic part, respectively), where $\ell$ and $q$ are bounded by a constant depending only on $k$ and the desired level of approximation. This generalises a result of Alon, Fox and Zhao on the structure of sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension, and is analogous to contemporaneous work of the authors arXiv:2111.01737 in the setting of 3-uniform hypergraphs.
  The main result originally appeared--albeit with a different proof--in a 2021 preprint arXiv:2111.01739, which has since been split into two: the present work, which focuses on higher arity NIP and develops a theory of local uniformity semi-norms of possibly independent interest, and its companion arXiv:2111.01739, which strengthens these results under a generalized notion of stability.</description>

      <title>Flexible DP 3-coloring of sparse multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{request} on a graph assigns a preferred color to a subset of the vertices. A graph $G$ is \emph{$\epsilon$-flexibly $k$-choosable} if for every $k$-list assignment $L$ and every request $r$ on $G$, there is an $L$-coloring such that an $\epsilon$-fraction of the requests are satisfied. This notion was introduced in 2019 by Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Norin, and Postle, who also proved important properties of flexible colorings and posed several natural problems. However, the weighted version of this problem is a special case of the much older problem of fractional hypergraph matchings, introduced by Lov\'asz in 1975. We study flexibly DP-colorable multigraphs. We prove that every loopless multigraph with maximum average degree less than $3$ is $\frac{1}{5}$-flexibly DP $3$-colorable, except for an infinite family of multigraphs that we completely characterize. The constant $\epsilon = \frac 15$ is best possible in the weighted setting, as shown by an infinite family of tight examples. Our result follows from a stronger statement in terms of potential. We also provide a family of graphs that gives a negative answer to a question by Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Norin, and Postle regarding flexibility for list coloring in the setting of DP-coloring.</description>

      <title>Existence of 3 anti-cocircular truncated M\"obius planes and constructions of strength-4 covering arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two projective (affine) planes with the same point sets are orthogoval if the common intersection of any two lines, one from each, has size at most two. The existence of a pair of orthogoval projective planes has been proven and published independently many times. A strength-$t$ covering array, denoted by CA$(N; t, k, v)$, is an $N \times k$ array over a $v$-set such that in any $t$-set of columns, each $t$-tuple occurs at least once in a row. A pair of orthogoval projective planes can be used to construct a strength-$3$ covering array CA$(2q^3-1; 3, q^2 + q + 1, q)$. Our work extends this result to construct arrays of strength $4$. A $k$-cap in a projective geometry is a set of $k$ points no three of which are collinear. In $PG(3,q)$, an ovoid is a maximum-sized $k$-cap with $k =q^2+1$. Its plane sections (circles) are the blocks of a $3-(q^2 + 1, q + 1, 1)$ design, called a M\"obius plane of order $q$. For $q$ an odd prime power, we prove the existence of three truncated M\"obius planes, such that for any choice of these circles, one from each plane, their intersection size is at most three. From this, we construct a strength-$4$ covering array CA$(3q^4-2; 4, \frac{q^2+1}{2}, q)$. For $q \geq 11$, these covering arrays improve the size of the best-known covering arrays with the same parameters by almost 25 percent. The CA$(3q^4 -3; 4, \frac{q^2 +1}{2}, q)$ is used as the main ingredient in a recursive construction to obtain a CA$(5q^4 - 4q^3 - q^2 + 2q; 4, q^2 +1, q)$. Some improvements are obtained in the size of the best-known arrays using these covering arrays.</description>

      <title>Parity patterns meet Genocchi numbers, I: four labelings and three bijections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hetyei introduced in 2019 the homogenized Linial arrangement and showed that its regions are counted by the median Genocchi numbers. In the course of devising a different proof of Hetyei's result, Lazar and Wachs considered another hyperplane arrangement that is associated with certain bipartite graph called Ferrers graph. We bijectively label the regions of this latter arrangement with permutations whose ascents are subject to a parity restriction. This labeling not only establishes the equivalence between two enumerative results due to Hetyei and Lazar-Wachs, repectively, but also motivates us to derive and investigate a Seidel-like triangle that interweaves Genocchi numbers of both kinds.
  Applying similar ideas, we introduce three more variants of permutations with analogous parity restrictions. We provide labelings for regions of the aforementioned arrangement using these three sets of restricted permutations as well. Furthermore, bijections from our first permutation model to two previously known permutation models are established.</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Bases of Polyzetas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two confluent rewriting systems in noncommutatives polynomials are constructed using the equations allowing the identification of the local coordinates (of second kind) of the graphs of the $\zeta$ polymorphism as being (shuffle or quasi-shuffle) characters and bridging two algebraic structures of polyzetas.  In each system, the left side of each rewriting rule corresponds to the leading monomial of the associated homogeneous in weight polynomial while the right side is canonically represented on the Q-algebra generated by irreducible terms which encode an algebraic basis of the Q-algebra of polyzetas. These polynomials are totally lexicographically ordered and generate the kernels of the $\zeta$ polymorphism meaning that the Q-free algebra of polyzetas is graded and the irreducible polyzetas are transcendent numbers, Q-algebraically independent, and then $\pi$ 2 is Q-algebraically independent on odd zeta values (so does $\pi$).</description>

Abstract: To factorize and to decompose the graphs of representative functions on the free monoid X * (generated by the alphabet X ) with values in the ring A containing Q, we examine various products of series (as concatenation, shuffle and its $\phi$ -deformations) and co-products, which are such that their associated non graded bialgebras are isomorphic, for A is a field K, to the Sweedler's dual of the graded noncommutative co-commutative K-bialgebra of polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $t$-tone coloring of a graph $G$ assigns to each vertex a set of $t$ colors such that any pair of vertices $u, v$ with distance $d$ can share at most $d-1$ colors. In this note, we prove several new results on $t$-tone coloring. For example we prove a new result for trees of large maximum degree, as well as some results for the cartesian power of a graph. We also make a conjecture about trees.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic estimation for two classes of generalized Fibonacci sub-sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the $\mathrm{Fibonacci}$ sequence has good properties, it's important in theory and applications, such as in combinatorics, cryptography, and so on. In this paper, for the generalized Fibonacci sequence $\left\{W_n\left(a,b,p,q\right)\right\}$, by using elementary methods and techniques, we respectively give the asymptotic estimation values of $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{W_{mk+l}^d}\right)^{-1}$ and $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\left(-1\right)^k}{W_{mk+l}^d}\right)^{-1}$, which generalize the asymptotic estimation results of Yuan et al. \cite{A14} in 2025.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ averages of the discrete Fourier transform and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete Fourier transform has proven to be an essential tool in many geometric and combinatorial problems in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform appear more `random' and are easier to analyze. However, there is a trade-off: in many cases, obtaining good uniform bounds is not possible, even in situations where many points satisfy strong pointwise bounds. To address this limitation, the first named author proposed an approach where one attempts to replace the need for uniform ($L^\infty$) bounds with suitable bounds for the $L^p$ average of the Fourier transform. In subsequent joint work, the authors applied this approach successfully to improve known results in Fourier restriction and the study of orthogonal projections. In this survey we discuss this general approach, give several examples, and exhibit some of the recent applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important question in the study of quasi-perfect codes is whether such codes can be constructed for all possible lengths $n$. In this paper, we address this question for specific values of $n$. First, we investigate the existence of quasi-perfect codes in the Cartesian product of a graph $G$ and a path (or cycle), assuming that $G$ admits a perfect code. Second, we explore quasi-perfect codes in the Cartesian products of two or three cycles, $C_m\square C_n$ and $C_m\square C_n\square C_l$, as well as in the Cartesian products of two or three paths, $P_m\square P_n$ and $P_m\square P_n\square P_l$.</description>

      <title>VC-Dimension vs Degree: An Uncertainty Principle for Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we uncover a new uncertainty principle that governs the complexity of Boolean functions. This principle manifests as a fundamental trade-off between two central measures of complexity: a combinatorial complexity of its supported set, captured by its Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension ($\mathrm{VC}(f)$), and its algebraic structure, captured by its polynomial degree over various fields. We establish two primary inequalities that formalize this trade-off:$\mathrm{VC}(f)+\deg(f)\ge n,$ and $\mathrm{VC}(f)+\deg_{\mathbb{F}_2}(f)\ge n$. In particular, these results recover the classical uncertainty principle on the discrete hypercube, as well as the Sziklai--Weiner's bound in the case of $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study universal cycles on the Grassmannian $G_q(2,n)$, the set of $2$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. While their existence is known from inductive and Eulerian graph methods, we give a direct algebraic construction when $n$ is odd under the coprimality condition $\gcd(n,\,q(q^2-1))=1$, using a projective-ratio decomposition and a global product condition. We also present explicit examples where a single cycle is simultaneously universal for both $G_q(2,5)$ and $G_q(3,5)$, realizing Grassmannian duality $|G_q(k,n)|=|G_q(n-k,n)|$ at the level of universal cycles.</description>

      <title>Forbidding the subdivided claw as a subgraph or a mino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be the subdivided claw, the $7$-vertex tree obtained from a claw $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing each edge exactly once. We characterize the graphs that do not have $Y$ as a subgraph, or, equivalently, do not have $Y$ as a minor. This work was motivated by a problem involving VCD minors. A graph $H$ is a vertex contraction-deletion minor, or VCD minor, of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions or contractions of all edges incident with a single vertex. Our result is a key step in describing $K_{1,3}$-VCD-minor-free line graphs. Moreover, our characterization raises some general questions about the structure of graphs forbidding a specific tree as a minor.</description>

      <title>Framed Polytopes and Higher Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early 1990s, Kapranov and Voevodsky proposed a geometric method for constructing higher-categorical pasting diagrams from generically framed convex polytopes. This work revisits their construction and identifies a convex-geometric condition that is both necessary and sufficient for the procedure to yield a well-defined pasting diagram. Our criterion, the absence of cellular loops, relates their construction to the theory of cellular strings, an active area of convex geometry originating in the Baues problem. This paper introduces higher-dimensional cellular strings and uses them to disprove the Kapranov-Voevodsky conjecture in the following strong sense. Not only do we exhibit framed polytopes admitting cellular loops, but we also construct examples for which every admissible frame produces one. As observed by these authors, Street's orientals arise from canonically framed cyclic simplices. We establish that this family is exceptional as any random $n$-simplex, canonically framed, almost surely exhibits cellular loops in the large $n$-limit.</description>

      <title>Skeletons and Spectra: Bernoulli graphings are relatively Ramanujan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the spectral theory of unimodular random graphs and graphings representing them. We prove that Bernoulli graphings are relatively Ramanujan with respect to their skeleton Markov chain. That is, the part of their spectrum that comes from the random labels falls within the appropriate Alon-Boppana bound. This result complements an example due to Fr\k{a}czyk of an ergodic unimodular random graph with almost sure spectral gap but non-expanding Bernoulli graphing.
  We also highlight connections of our work with the theory of finite random graphs. Exploiting the result of Bordenave and Collins on random lifts being relatively almost Ramanujan, we prove a strengthening of our main theorem for unimodular quasi-transitive quasi-trees.</description>

      <title>Diameter and mixing time of the giant component in the percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider bond percolation on the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube with $p=c/d$ for fixed $c&gt;1$. We prove that the typical diameter of the giant component $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d)$, and the typical mixing time of the lazy random walk on $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d^2)$. This resolves long-standing open problems of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa and {\L}uczak from 1994, and of Benjamini and Mossel from 2003.
  A key component in our approach is a new tight large deviation estimate on the number of vertices in $L_1$ whose proof includes several novel ingredients: a structural description of the residue outside the giant component after sprinkling, a tight quantitative estimate on the spread of the giant in the hypercube, and a stability principle which rules out the disintegration of large connected sets under thinning. This toolkit further allows us to obtain optimal bounds on the expansion in $L_1$.</description>

      <title>Matrix Points on Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of $C_n(X)$, the moduli space of commuting $n$-by-$n$ matrices satisfying the equations defining a variety $X$. This space can be viewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic" counterpart $S_n(X)$, constructed as a convolution $X^n \times^{S_n} \mathrm{GL}_n/\mathrm{T}_n$. Our main result establishes that a natural map $\sigma \colon S_n(X) \to C_n(X)$ induces an isomorphism on $\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$ or the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the classical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion correspondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the Betti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we prove a Hermitian variant of our main result.</description>

      <title>On some affine semigroups characterized by a finite-state automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new kind of affine semigroups called $P$-semigroups. Within the framework of $\mathcal C$-semigroups, we define a finite-state automaton associated to them. Moreover, this automaton determines whether a $\mathcal C$-semigroup is a $P$-semigroup, which represents a bridge between affine semigroups and Discrete Mathematics. Furthermore, some algorithms for computing all the $P$-semigroups with a fixed Frobenius element, genus, or multiplicity are provided.</description>

Abstract: We study certain arithmetic properties of an analogue $B(n)$ of Lin's restricted partition function that counts the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ comprise distinct odd parts and $\pi_3$ consists of parts divisible by $4$. With the help of elementary $q$-series techniques and modular functions, we establish Ramanujan-type congruences modulo $2,3,5,7$, and $9$ for certain sums involving $B(n)$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Bounds for List Recovery via Discrete Brascamp--Lieb Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In coding theory, the problem of list recovery asks one to find all codewords $c$ of a given code $C$ which such that at least $1-\rho$ fraction of the symbols of $c$ lie in some predetermined set of $\ell$ symbols for each coordinate of the code. A key question is bounding the maximum possible list size $L$ of such codewords for the given code $C$.
  In this paper, we give novel combinatorial bounds on the list recoverability of various families of linear and folded linear codes, including random linear codes, random Reed--Solomon codes, explicit folded Reed--Solomon codes, and explicit univariate multiplicity codes. Our main result is that in all of these settings, we show that for code of rate $R$, when $\rho = 1 - R - \epsilon$ approaches capacity, the list size $L$ is at most $(\ell/(R+\epsilon))^{O(R/\epsilon)}$. These results also apply in the average-radius regime. Our result resolves a long-standing open question on whether $L$ can be bounded by a polynomial in $\ell$. In the zero-error regime, our bound on $L$ perfectly matches known lower bounds.
  The primary technique is a novel application of a discrete entropic Brascamp--Lieb inequality to the problem of list recovery, allowing us to relate the local structure of each coordinate with the global structure of the recovered list. As a result of independent interest, we show that a recent result by Chen and Zhang (STOC 2025) on the list decodability of folded Reed--Solomon codes can be generalized into a novel Brascamp--Lieb type inequality.</description>

      <title>From Random to Explicit via Subspace Designs With Applications to Local Properties and Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In coding theory, a common question is to understand the threshold rates of various local properties of codes, such as their list decodability and list recoverability. A recent work Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya (FOCS 2025) gave a novel unified framework for calculating the threshold rates of local properties for random linear and random Reed--Solomon codes.
  In this paper, we extend their framework to studying the local properties of subspace designable codes, including explicit folded Reed-Solomon and univariate multiplicity codes. Our first main result is a local equivalence between random linear codes and (nearly) optimal subspace design codes up to an arbitrarily small rate decrease. We show any local property of random linear codes applies to all subspace design codes. As such, we give the first explicit construction of folded linear codes that simultaneously attain all local properties of random linear codes. Conversely, we show that any local property which applies to all subspace design codes also applies to random linear codes.
  Our second main result is an application to matroid theory. We show that the correctable erasure patterns in a maximally recoverable tensor code can be identified in deterministic polynomial time, assuming a positive answer to a matroid-theoretic question due to Mason (1981). This improves on a result of Jackson and Tanigawa (JCTB 2024) who gave a complexity characterization of $\mathsf{RP} \cap \mathsf{coNP}$ assuming a stronger conjecture. Our result also applies to the generic bipartite rigidity and matrix completion matroids.
  As a result of additional interest, we study the existence and limitations of subspace designs. In particular, we tighten the analysis of family of subspace designs constructioned by Guruswami and Kopparty (Combinatorica 2016) and show that better subspace designs do not exist over algebraically closed fields.</description>

Abstract: The lattice size of a lattice polytope is a geometric invariant which was formally introduced in the context of simplification of the defining equation of an algebraic curve, but appeared implicitly earlier in geometric combinatorics. Previous work on the lattice size was devoted to studying the lattice size in dimension 2 and 3. In this paper we establish explicit formulas for the lattice size of a family of lattice simplices in arbitrary dimension.</description>

Abstract: In 1976, Cameron, Goethals, Seidel, and Shult classified all the graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-2$ by relating such graphs to root systems that occur in the classification of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper, extending their beautiful theorem, we give a complete classification of all connected graphs with smallest eigenvalue in $(-\lambda^*, -2)$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, and $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. Our result is the first classification of infinitely many connected graphs with their smallest eigenvalue in $(-\lambda, -2)$ for any constant $\lambda &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Deformed Homogeneous Polynomials and the Generalized $q$-Exponential Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the deformed homogeneous polynomials $\mathrm{R}_{n}(x,y;u|q)$. These polynomials generalize some classical polynomials: the Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials $\mathrm{h}_{n}(x|q)$, the generalized Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials $\mathrm{r}_{n}(x,y)$, the Stieljes-Wigert polynomials $\mathrm{S}_{n}(x;q)$, among others. Basic properties of the polynomial $\mathrm{R}_{n}$ are given, along with recurrence relations, its $q$-difference equation, and representations. Generating functions for the polynomials $\mathrm{R}_{n}(x,y;u|q)$ are given. These functions include generalizations of the Mehler and Rogers formulas. In addition, generalizations of the $q$-binomial formula and the Heine transformation formula are obtained. These results are obtained via the $u$-deformed $q$-exponential operator $\mathrm{E}(yD_{q}|u)$, defined here. From this operator, we obtain for free the operators T$(yD_{q})$ the Chen, $\mathrm{R}(yD_{q})$ of Saad, $\mathcal{E}(yD_{q})$ of Exton, and $\mathcal{R}(yD_{q})$ of Rogers-Ramanujan when $u=1,q,\sqrt{q},q^2$, respectively. We introduce the deformed basic hypergeometric series ${}_{r}\Phi_{s}$, a generalization of the classical basic hypergeometric series. New transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series are obtained.</description>

      <title>A Galois structure on the orbit of large steps walks in the quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enumeration of weighted walks in the quarter plane reduces to studying a functional equation with two catalytic variables. When the steps of the walk are small, Bousquet-M\'elou and Mishna defined a group called the group of the walk which turned out to be crucial in the classification of the small steps models. In particular, its action on the catalytic variables provides a convenient set of changes of variables in the functional equation. This particular set called the orbit has been generalized to models with arbitrary large steps by Bostan, Bousquet-M\'elou and Melczer (BBMM). However, the orbit had till now no underlying group.
  In this article, we endow the orbit with the action of a Galois group, which extends the notion of the group of the walk to models with large steps. As an application, we look into a general strategy to prove the algebraicity of models with small backwards steps, which uses the fundamental objects that are invariants and decoupling. The group action on the orbit allows us to develop a Galoisian approach to these two notions. Up to the knowledge of the finiteness of the orbit, this gives systematic procedures to test their existence and construct them. Our constructions lead to the first proofs of algebraicity of weighted models with large steps, proving in particular a conjecture of BBMM, and allowing to find new algebraic models with large steps.</description>

Abstract: The general position problem asks for large sets of vertices such that no three vertices of the set lie on a common shortest path. Recently a dynamic version of this problem was defined, called the \emph{mobile general position problem}, in which a collection of robots must visit all the vertices of the graph whilst remaining in general position. In this paper we investigate this problem in the context of Cartesian products, corona products and joins, giving upper and lower bounds for general graphs and exact values for families including grids, cylinders, Hamming graphs and prisms of trees.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of infinite words $x_k$ , where $k$ is a positive integer, recently introduced by J. Shallit. This class includes the Thue-Morse sequence $x_1$, the Fibonacci-Thue-Morse sequence $x_2$, and the Allouche-Johnson sequence $x_3$. Shallit stated and for $k = 3$ proved two conjectures on properties of $x_k$. The first conjecture concerns the factor complexity, the second one the critical exponent of these words. We confirm the validity of both conjectures for every $k$.</description>

      <title>Structure of $k$-Matching-Planar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $k \geqslant 0$, we define a simple topological graph $G$ (that is, a graph drawn in the plane such that every pair of edges intersect at most once, including endpoints) to be $k$-matching-planar if for every edge $e \in E(G)$, every matching amongst the edges of $G$ that cross $e$ has size at most $k$. The class of $k$-matching-planar graphs is a significant generalisation of many other existing beyond planar graph classes, including $k$-planar graphs. We prove that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph is isomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This result qualitatively extends the planar graph product structure theorem of Dujmovi\'c, Joret, Micek, Morin, Ueckerdt, and Wood [J. ACM 2020] and recent product structure theorems for other beyond planar graph classes. Using this result, we deduce that the class of simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs has several attractive properties, making it the broadest class of simple beyond planar graphs in the literature that has these properties. All of our results about simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs generalise to the non-simple setting, where the maximum number of pairwise crossing edges incident to a common vertex becomes relevant.
  The paper introduces several tools and results of independent interest. We show that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph admits an edge-colouring with $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}\log k)$ colours such that monochromatic edges do not cross. As a key ingredient of the proof of our main product structure theorem, we introduce the concept of weak shallow minors, which subsume and generalise shallow minors, a key concept in graph sparsity theory. We also establish upper bounds on the treewidth of graphs with well-behaved circular drawings that qualitatively generalise several existing results.</description>

      <title>Recursions, Trains, Trees, and Combinatorial Rod Set Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a physical model of ordered sums of integers as trains of rods. The trains for a fixed, possibly infinite, set of rod lengths naturally correspond to nodes in a tree; relations among finite linear recursions encoded in the subtrees define algebraic operations on sets of rods. We use this algebra to prove classic identities for recursively defined sequences, to show that Lucas sequences are divisibility sequences, to characterize two-term linear Fibonacci identities, and to find the cyclotomic polynomial factors of Borwein trinomials. We complement abstractions with lots of examples.</description>

      <title>Odd hypergraph Mantel theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result of Sidorenko (1989) shows that the Tur\'{a}n density of every $r$-uniform hypergraph with three edges is bounded from above by $1/2$. For even $r$, this bound is tight, as demonstrated by Mantel's theorem on triangles and Frankl's theorem on expanded triangles. In this note, we prove that for odd $r$, the bound $1/2$ is never attained, thereby answering a question of Keevash and revealing a fundamental difference between hypergraphs of odd and even uniformity. Moreover, our result implies that the expanded triangles form the unique class of three-edge hypergraphs whose Tur\'{a}n density attains $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Bounded indegree $k$-forests problem and a faster algorithm for directed graph augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two problems for a directed graph $G$, which we show to be closely related. The first one is to find $k$ edge-disjoint forests in $G$ of maximal size such that the indegree of each vertex in these forests is at most $k$. We describe a min-max characterization for this problem and show that it can be solved in $O(k \delta m \log n)$ time, where $(n,m)$ is the size of $G$ and $\delta$ is the difference between $k$ and the edge connectivity of the graph. The second problem is the directed edge-connectivity augmentation problem, which has been extensively studied before: find a smallest set of directed edges whose addition to the graph makes it strongly $k$-connected. We improve the complexity for this problem from $O(k \delta (m+\delta n)\log n)$ [Gabow, STOC 1994] to $O(k \delta m \log n)$, by exploiting our solution for the first problem. A similar approach with the same complexity also works for the undirected version of the problem.</description>

      <title>On combinatorics of plus-one generated line arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we focus on combinatorial aspects of plus-one generated line arrangements. We provide combinatorial constraints on such arrangements and we construct a polynomial that decodes the plus-one generated property. We present new examples of plus-one generated arrangements constructed by using classical Klein and Wiman reflection arrangements, and we detect, among all known sporadic simplicial arrangements up to $27$ lines, exactly $9$ arrangements that are minimal plus-one generated.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a certain restricted partition function of Lin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $b(n)$ be the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ consists of distinct odd parts, and $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ consist of parts divisible by $4$. Utilizing modular forms, Lin obtained the generating functions for $b(3n+1)$ and $b(3n+2)$, which yields the congruence $b(3n+2)\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ for all $n\geq 0$. We provide in this note elementary proofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas. We also establish infinite families of internal congruences modulo $3$ for $b(n)$.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetrical traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to identify the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is the number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the corresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. On average, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has the expected frequency bigger than $\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has the expected frequency smaller than 2. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge computed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\in [4, n]$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge has its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq [0.3660n + 5.5849]$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Higher-arity PAC learning, VC dimension and packing lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to overview some of our work in Chernikov, Towsner'20 (arXiv:2010.00726) developing higher arity VC theory (VC$_n$ dimension), including a generalization of Haussler packing lemma, and an associated tame (slice-wise) hypergraph regularity lemma; and to demonstrate that it characterizes higher arity PAC learning (PAC$_n$ learning) in $n$-fold product spaces with respect to product measures introduced by Kobayashi, Kuriyama and Takeuchi'15. We also point out how some of the recent results in arXiv:2402.14294, arXiv:2505.15688, arXiv:2509.20404 follow from our work in arXiv:2010.00726.</description>

      <title>Stranding $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$.
  This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</description>
