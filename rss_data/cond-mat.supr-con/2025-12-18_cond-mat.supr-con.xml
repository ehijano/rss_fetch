      <title>High efficiency superconducting diode effect in a gate-tunable double-loop SQUID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), the superconducting diode effect may be generated by interference of multiple harmonic components in the current-phase relationships (CPRs) of different branches forming SQUID loops. Through the inclusion of two gate-tunable Josephson junctions in series in each interference branch of a double-loop SQUID, we demonstrate independent control over both the harmonic content and the amplitude of three interfering CPRs, facilitating significant improvement in the maximum diode efficiency. Through optimized gate-controlled tuning of individual Josephson energies, diode efficiency exceeding 50% is demonstrated. Flux-dependent oscillations show quantitative agreement with a simple model of SQUID operation.</description>

      <title>Spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductor with spin-orbit interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study impacts of spin-orbit interactions on the spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductors, motivated by the anomolous superconducting properties in the van der Waals quasicrystal Ta$_{1.6}$Te under magnetic fields. We consider the Penrose tiling model with $s$-wave pairing as a representative system and include anisotropic spin-orbit interactions allowed for the quasicrystal structure. It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. For an Ising-type spin-orbit interaction, the spin susceptibility only for in-plane magnetic fields is increased, while the out-of-plane spin susceptibility is almost unchanged. When there are both kinds of the spin-orbit interactions, temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility for any field directions is suppressed.</description>

      <title>Conventional $s$-wave Superconductivity in LaRh$_2$As$_2$; the Analog without the 4$f$ Electrons of CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor LaRh$_2$As$_2$ has the same crystal structures as CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which exhibits superconducting (SC) multiphase in the $c$-axis magnetic field. Although the SC transition temperatures $T_c$ are similar, around 0.3 K, LaRh$_2$As$_2$ shows conventional type-II superconductivity with a small upper critical field $H_{c2}\sim$ 10 mT. At present, the SC properties of LaRh$_2$As$_2$ have not been clarified yet. We performed $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on LaRh$_2$As$_2$ to investigate the SC properties and gap structure. $1/T_1$ shows a clear coherence peak just below $T_c$ and an exponential decrease at lower temperatures, suggesting full-gap $s$-wave superconductivity. The numerical calculations based on an $s$-wave SC model reveal an SC gap size of $\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} \sim 1.48$, consistent with the weak-coupling $s$-wave superconductivity. These results suggest that the 4$f$ electrons in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ not only enhance the orbital limiting field but also contribute to the formation of unconventional superconductivity with SC multiphase.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect due to Chiral Meissner Currents in a Hollow Superconducting Helix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a key nonreciprocal phenomenon with broad relevance for superconducting electronics. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations, we predict and quantify a superconducting diode effect arising solely from geometric chirality imposed to a conventional superconductor. The helical geometry and magnetic-field-induced screening currents produce inequivalent critical currents for opposite polarities. The diode efficiency reaches a maximum when one current direction first nucleates vortices, revealing a chirality-controlled crossover between screening- and vortex-dominated nonreciprocity. These results establish mesoscopic geometric chirality as a robust mechanism for supercurrent rectification in an achiral superconductor. They suggest an experimentally accessible route towards 3D superconducting diodes for multi-level integrated quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Multiple Quasiparticle Bound States in a Trap Created by a Local Superconducting Gap Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low temperature, the concentration of quasiparticles observed in superconducting circuits far exceeds the predictions of microscopic BCS theory at equilibrium. As a source of dissipation, these excess quasiparticles degrade the performance of various devices. Therefore, understanding their dynamics, especially their recombination into Cooper pairs, is an active topic of current research. In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap. These results deepen our understanding of trapped quasiparticles and may have important implications for their recombination in disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Changes in Structure, Magnetic Order and Development of Superconductivity in the Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi8Te13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n &lt; 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Pair-density-wave superconductivity and Anderson's theorem in bilayer nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetization in the multiphase superconductor PdBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors have specific signatures in their magnetic properties, such as intrinsic magnetization at interfaces and around defects and fractional and multiquanta vortices, with much attention focused on heavy fermion and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we report the observation of highly anomalous magnetization in $\beta$-PdBi$_2$, a layered superconductor previously shown to exhibit a magnetic field-induced transition from s-wave to nodal p-wave superconductivity at a transition field $H^*\sim$0.1 T ($H_{C1}&lt;H^*&lt;H_{C2}$). This transition is driven by the coupling between spin-polarized electronic bands and the in-plane magnetic field. In the unconventional phase (above $H^*$) we observe three striking features: strictly linear and non-hysteretic dc magnetization, a sharp drop in the ac susceptibility when the field is applied parallel to the ab-plane, and a pronounced anisotropy in the magnetic response between parallel and perpendicular field orientations. We show that these features are directly correlated with the expected transition to the nodal p-wave state and propose that the unusual magnetization behavior can be explained by a transition from a conventional vortex lattice in the low-field s-wave phase to a domain structure corresponding to spatial phase separation into superconducting (p-wave) and normal domains above $H^*$. Our work identifies new experimental signatures of unconventional multiphase superconductivity, offering an insight into the magnetic-field response of nodal states.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an SU(2)xU(1) genralization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

      <title>Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs) of superconducting qubits (SCQs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing (FTSQC). Nonetheless, quantitative experimental estimation on QPG rates has remained vague. Here, we investigate QPG using strongly driven SCQs, reaching qubit drive amplitudes up to $2\pi\times$300 GHz by applying intense drive fields through the readout resonators. The resonator nonlinear responses enable quantification of the energy loss at SCQs, including the contribution from QPG. Surprisingly, the estimated total energy loss rates are far lower than those expected by the Floquet-Markov formalism with QPG as the sole loss mechanism. Meanwhile, calculations that incorporate high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) in the QPG conductance at approximately 17-20 GHz effectively explain the experimental observations. These results suggest limitations in either the QPG conductance model or the Markovian treatment of the QPG processes. Both possibilities possess crucial implications for handling QPG problems toward FTSQC and for a more deeper understanding of Josephson junctions.</description>
