      <title>The common revenue allocation based on modified Shapley value and DEA cross-efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to design a fair and reasonable allocation plan for the common revenue of the alliance is considered in this paper. We regard the common revenue to be allocated as an exogenous variable which will not participate in the subsequent production process. The production organizations can cooperate with each other and form alliances. As the DEA cross-efficiency combines self- and peer-evaluation mechanisms, and the cooperative game allows fair negotiation among participants, we combine the cross-efficiency with the cooperative game theory and construct the modified Shapley value to reflect the contribution of the evaluated participant to the alliance. In addition, for each participant, both the optimistic and the pessimistic modified Shapley values are considered, and thus the upper and lower bounds of the allocation revenue are obtained, correspondingly. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the operation procedure. Finally, we apply the approach to an empirical application concerning a city commercial bank with 18 branches in China.</description>

      <title>Common revenue allocation in DMUs with two stages based on DEA cross-efficiency and cooperative game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine two-stage production organizations as decision-making units (DMUs) that can collaborate to form alliances. We present a novel approach to transform a grand coalition of n DMUs with a two-stage structure into 2n single-stage sub-DMUs by extending the vectors of the initial input, intermediate product, and final output, thus creating a 2n*2n DEA cross-efficiency (CREE) matrix. By combining cooperative game theory with CREE and utilizing three cooperative game solution concepts, namely, the nucleolus, the least core and the Shapley value, a characteristic function is developed to account for two types of allocation, i.e., direct allocation and secondary allocation. Moreover, the super-additivity and the core non-emptiness properties are explored. It is found that the sum of the revenue allocated to all DMUs will remain constant at each stage regardless of the allocation manner and the cooperative solution concept selected. To illustrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach, both a numerical example and an empirical application are provided.</description>

      <title>On Robustness to $k$-wise Independence of Optimal Bayesian Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reexamines the classic problem of revenue maximization in single-item auctions with $n$ buyers under the lens of the robust optimization framework. The celebrated Myerson's mechanism is the format that maximizes the seller's revenue under the prior distribution, which is mutually independent across all $n$ buyers. As argued in a recent line of work (Caragiannis et al. 22), (Dughmi et al. 24), mutual independence is a strong assumption that is extremely hard to verify statistically, thus it is important to relax the assumption.
  While optimal under mutual independent prior, we find that Myerson's mechanism may lose almost all of its revenue when the independence assumption is relaxed to pairwise independence, i.e., Myerson's mechanism is not pairwise-robust. The mechanism regains robustness when the prior is assumed to be 3-wise independent. In contrast, we show that second-price auctions with anonymous reserve, including optimal auctions under i.i.d. priors, lose at most a constant fraction of their revenues on any regular pairwise independent prior. Our findings draw a comprehensive picture of robustness to $k$-wise independence in single-item auction settings.</description>

      <title>On the Viability of Open-Source Financial Rails: Economic Security of Permissionless Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitcoin demonstrated the possibility of a financial ledger that operates without the need for a trusted central authority. However, concerns persist regarding its security and considerable energy consumption. We assess the consensus protocols that underpin Bitcoin's functionality, questioning whether they can ensure economically meaningful security while maintaining a permissionless design that allows free entry of operators. We answer this affirmatively by constructing a protocol that guarantees economic security and preserves Bitcoin's permissionless design. This protocol's security does not depend on monetary payments to miners or immense electricity consumption, which our analysis suggests are ineffective. Our framework integrates economic theory with distributed systems theory, and highlights the role of the protocol's user community.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Extending the Accessibility of Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variation of facility location problems (FLPs) that aims to improve the accessibility of agents to the facility within the context of mechanism design without money. In such a variation, agents have preferences on the ideal locations of the facility on a real line, and the facility's location is fixed in advance where (re)locating the facility is not possible due to various constraints (e.g., limited space and construction costs). To improve the accessibility of agents to facilities, existing mechanism design literature in FLPs has proposed to structurally modify the real line (e.g., by adding a new interval) or provide shuttle services between two points when structural modifications are not possible. In this paper, we focus on the latter approach and propose to construct an accessibility range to extend the accessibility of the facility. In the range, agents can receive accommodations (e.g., school buses, campus shuttles, or pickup services) to help reach the facility. Therefore, the cost of each agent is the distance from their ideal location to the facility (possibility) through the range. We focus on designing strategyproof mechanisms that elicit true ideal locations from the agents and construct accessibility ranges (intervals) to approximately minimize the social cost or the maximum cost of agents. For both social and maximum costs, we design group strategyproof mechanisms with asymptotically tight bounds on the approximation ratios.</description>

      <title>Consumable Data via Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data and Bob holds $m$ inputs, and he wants to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation on Alice's data and each of his inputs. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$.
  For these examples, data behaves like a consumable resource when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization finds Nash Equilibrium in Regularized General-Sum LQ Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of introducing relative entropy regularization on the Nash Equilibria (NE) of General-Sum $N$-agent games, revealing the fact that the NE of such games conform to linear Gaussian policies. Moreover, it delineates sufficient conditions, contingent upon the adequacy of entropy regularization, for the uniqueness of the NE within the game. As Policy Optimization serves as a foundational approach for Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques aimed at finding the NE, in this work we prove the linear convergence of a policy optimization algorithm which (subject to the adequacy of entropy regularization) is capable of provably attaining the NE. Furthermore, in scenarios where the entropy regularization proves insufficient, we present a $\delta$-augmentation technique, which facilitates the achievement of an $\epsilon$-NE within the game.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Decision-Making under Agents with Persistent Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies algorithmic decision-making under human's strategic behavior, where a decision maker uses an algorithm to make decisions about human agents, and the latter with information about the algorithm may exert effort strategically and improve to receive favorable decisions. Unlike prior works that assume agents benefit from their efforts immediately, we consider realistic scenarios where the impacts of these efforts are persistent and agents benefit from efforts by making improvements gradually. We first develop a dynamic model to characterize persistent improvements and based on this construct a Stackelberg game to model the interplay between agents and the decision-maker. We analytically characterize the equilibrium strategies and identify conditions under which agents have incentives to improve. With the dynamics, we then study how the decision-maker can design an optimal policy to incentivize the largest improvements inside the agent population. We also extend the model to settings where 1) agents may be dishonest and game the algorithm into making favorable but erroneous decisions; 2) honest efforts are forgettable and not sufficient to guarantee persistent improvements. With the extended models, we further examine conditions under which agents prefer honest efforts over dishonest behavior and the impacts of forgettable efforts.</description>

      <title>AlphaDou: High-Performance End-to-End Doudizhu AI Integrating Bidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence for card games has long been a popular topic in AI research. In recent years, complex card games like Mahjong and Texas Hold'em have been solved, with corresponding AI programs reaching the level of human experts. However, the game of Doudizhu presents significant challenges due to its vast state/action space and unique characteristics involving reasoning about competition and cooperation, making the game extremely difficult to solve.The RL model Douzero, trained using the Deep Monte Carlo algorithm framework, has shown excellent performance in Doudizhu. However, there are differences between its simplified game environment and the actual Doudizhu environment, and its performance is still a considerable distance from that of human experts. This paper modifies the Deep Monte Carlo algorithm framework by using reinforcement learning to obtain a neural network that simultaneously estimates win rates and expectations. The action space is pruned using expectations, and strategies are generated based on win rates. The modified algorithm enables the AI to perform the full range of tasks in the Doudizhu game, including bidding and cardplay. The model was trained in a actual Doudizhu environment and achieved state-of-the-art performance among publicly available models. We hope that this new framework will provide valuable insights for AI development in other bidding-based games.</description>
