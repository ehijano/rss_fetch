      <title>The Low-Temperature Electronic Specific Heats of Disordered Ag-Au Alloys, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered alloys of silver and gold have been in the interest of the condensed matter community for decades since they are the prototype of the ideal solid solution due to the chemical similarity of their constituents and due to their potential industrial applications. Although they are considered well-known materials, surprises have appeared that have not been well understood despite several studies performed. One example are the experimental results of the electronic specific heat at low temperatures of disordered Ag-Au alloys. In 1966, Green and Valladares [Phys. Rev. 142, 379 (1966)] conducted experimental studies of $\gamma$, the coefficient of the temperature in the expression for the electronic specific heat at low temperatures, finding a parabolic behavior as a function of the concentration, when a linear interpolation between the pure-element values was expected. This detonated several ulterior experiments that corroborated this parabolic behavior, and theoretical attempts followed that did not satisfactorily succeed at the explanation. It is our hope that this paper will contribute to the understanding of the experimental results; old problems can be reanalyzed with the help of new tools.</description>

      <title>A typical medium cluster approach for multi-branch phonon localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Anderson localization in various disordered media has sustained significant interest over many decades. Specifically, the Anderson localization of phonons has been viewed as a potential mechanism for creating fascinating thermal transport properties in materials. However, despite extensive work, the influence of the vector nature of phonons on the Anderson localization transition has not been well explored. In order to achieve such an understanding, we extend a recently developed phonon dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its typical medium variant (TMDCA) to investigate spectra and localization of multi-branch phonons in the presence of pure mass disorder. We validate the new formalism against several limiting cases and exact diagonalization results. A comparison of results for the single-branch versus multi-branch case shows that the vector nature of the phonons does not affect the Anderson transition of phonons significantly. The developed multi-branch TMDCA formalism can be employed for studying phonon localization in real materials.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculation of the entropy of liquids with a case study on sodium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite increasing demands for the thermodynamic data of liquids in a wide range of science and engineering fields, there is a still a considerable lack of reliable data over a wide range of temperature ($T$) and pressure conditions. The most significant obstacle is that there is no practical method to calculate the entropy ($S$) of liquids. This problem can be solved using the thermodynamic definition of entropy, i.e., $S = \int C d\ln T$, where $C$ is specific heat. The specific heat is calculated by the derivative of the internal energy $U$ with respect to $T$. Both quantities, i.e., $U$ and $T$, are well defined in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density functional theory. The reliability of the present method is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the specific heat of liquid, for which there is no standard model. The problem with liquids is that there are no eigenstates, based on which the standard procedures are constructed. The relationship between $U$ and $T$ is affected by the energy relaxation processes, the effect of which appears in the $T$ dependence on the specific heat of liquids. This motivates us to conduct MD simulations by isolating the system from an external heat bath. In this paper, by applying this method to the liquid sodium, it is demonstrated that the experimental $T$ dependence of the isochoric specific heat is reproduced well without any empirical parameter. On this basis, the entropy of the liquid Na is obtained with a good agreement with experimental values.</description>

      <title>Ward identities and local potential approximation for large time quantum (2+p)-spin glass dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to study the functional renormalization group for quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $x\in {R}^N$. By fixing the gauge symmetry in the construction of the FRG, that breaks the $O(N)$-symmetry and deriving the corresponding non-trivial Ward identity we can: In the first time coarse grain and focus on this study using a more attractive method such as the effective vertex expansion, and in the second time explore this model beyond the symmetry phase. We show finite scale singularities due to the disorder, interpreted as the signal in the perturbation theory. The unconventional renormalization group approach is based on coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic term, with an eigenvalue distribution following a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. As an illustration, the case where $p=3$ is scrutinized.</description>

      <title>On the breakdown of dimensional reduction and supersymmetry in random-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the breakdown of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry (SUSY) and of the dimensional-reduction (DR) property in the random field Ising and O($N$) models as a function of space dimension $d$ and/or number of components $N$. The functional renormalization group (FRG) predicts that this takes place below a critical line $d_{\rm DR}(N)$. We revisit the perturbative FRG results for the RFO($N$)M in $d=4+\epsilon$ and carry out a more comprehensive investigation of the nonperturbative FRG approximation for the RFIM. In light of this FRG description, we discuss the perturbative results in $\epsilon=6-d$ recently derived for the RFIM by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani. We stress in particular that the disappearance of the SUSY/DR fixed point below $d_{\rm DR}$ arises as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the FRG equations and cannot be found via the perturbative expansion in $\epsilon=6-d$ (nor in $1/N$). We also provide an error bar on the value of the critical dimension $d_{\rm DR}$ for the RFIM, which we find around $5.11\pm0.09$, by studying several successive orders of the nonperturbative FRG approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Spread Complexity in Non-Hermitian Many-Body Localization Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of spread complexity in the context of non-Hermitian many-body localization Transition (MBLT). Our analysis has shown that the singular value spread complexity is capable of distinguishing the ergodic and many-body localization (MBL) phase from the presaturation peak height for the non-hermitian models having time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and without TRS. On the other hand, the saturation value of the thermofield double (TFD) state complexity can detect the real-complex transition of the eigenvalues on increasing disorder strength. From the saturation value, we also distinguish the model with TRS and without TRS. The charge density wave complexity shows lower saturation values in the MBL phase for the model with TRS. However, the model without TRS shows a completely different behavior, which is also captivated by our analysis. So, our investigation unravels the real-complex transition in the eigenvalues, the difference between the model having TRS and without TRS, and the effect of boundary conditions for the non-hermitian models having MBL transitions, from the Krylov spread complexity perspective.</description>

      <title>An elastoplastic model approach for the relaxation dynamics of active glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How activity affects the glassy dynamics is crucial for several biological processes. Furthermore, active glasses offer fascinating phenomenologies, extend the scope of equilibrium glasses, and can provide novel insights into the original problem. We introduce a family of novel approaches to investigating the relaxation dynamics of active glasses via an active elastoplastic model (EPM). These approaches describe the relaxation dynamics via local plastic yielding and can provide improved insights as we can study various aspects of the system separately. Activity enters the model via three crucial features: activity-mediated plastic yielding, activated barrier crossing, and persistent rotational dynamics of the yielding direction. We first consider a minimal active EPM that adds the effect of active yielding to a thermal EPM. We show that this active EPM captures the known results of active glasses within a reasonable parameter space. The results also agree well with the analytical results for active glasses when activity is small. The minimal model breaks down at very low temperatures where other effects become important. Looking at the broader model class, we demonstrate that whereas active yielding primarily dominates the relaxation dynamics, the persistence of yielding direction governs the dynamic heterogeneity in active glasses.</description>

      <title>Real space quantum metric of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By acting the projector to the filled lattice eigenstates on a specific position, or applying local electron annihilation operator on the many-body ground state, one can construct a quantum state localized around a specific position in a solid. The overlap of two such local states at slightly different positions defines a quantum metric in real space, which manifests even in systems as simple as particles in a box. For continuous systems like electron gas, this metric weighted by the density gives the momentum variance of electrons, which is readily measurable by ARPES. The presence of disorder curves the real space manifold and gives rise to various differential geometrical quantities like Riemann tensor and Ricci scalar, indicating the possibility of engineering differential geometrical properties by disorder, as demonstrated by lattice models of 2D metals and topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: Amorphous solids form an enormous and underutilized class of materials. In order to drive the discovery of new useful amorphous materials further we need to achieve a closer convergence between computational and experimental methods. In this review, we highlight some of the important gaps between computational simulations and experiments, discuss popular state-of-the-art computational techniques such as the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) and Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC), and introduce more recent advances: machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and generative machine learning for simulations of amorphous matter, e.g., the Morphological Autoregressive Protocol (MAP). Examples are drawn from the amorphous silicon and silica literature as well as from molecular glasses. Our outlook stresses the need for new computational methods to extend the time- and length- scales accessible through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Localization and Dynamics in One-dimensional and Two-dimensional Gaussian Disordered Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian disorder, characterized by two parameters:the expected value and the standard deviation.Studying this type of disorder enhances our understanding of how many-body localization (MBL) transition is influenced by the central value and breadth of disorder.We apply Gaussian disorder to a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain to reveal its features.Our findings indicate that the crucial parameter driving localization transitions is the standard deviation; as it increases, the system transitions from the ergodic phase to the localized phase, while the expected value has no effect,so the critical factor influencing MBL transition is the breadth of disorder rather than its central value.We then explore Gaussian disorder in two system-environment models (hereafter referred to as the sye-env models, consisting of ladder configuration and staggered configuration),analyzing the mutual influence when they are coupled.We extensively explore the impacts brought about by system disorder,environment disorder,initial state,and the strength of the sys-env interaction.Finally,for theses two different models,we consider the system and environment as a whole,studying how the localization properties of the entire system are influenced by the disorder strength of each chain and the interaction strength between the two chains.In the ladder configuration, we observe a strong dependence on the initial state,which can lead to either the loss or retention of information,whereas no such dependence on the initial state is found in the staggered configuration.We emphasize that when using dynamic indicators to analyze system characteristics, it is essential to consider the influence of different initial states,as this may lead to significant differences under certain structural conditions,and not all initial states can accurately reflect the localization properties of the many-body system.</description>

      <title>Fractal Quasicondensation in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unveil a novel mechanism for quasicondensation of hard-core bosons in the presence of quasiperiodicity-induced multifractal single-particle states. The new critical state, here dubbed fractal quasicondensate, is characterized by natural orbitals with multifractal properties and by an occupancy of the lowest natural orbital, {\lambda}0 ~ L{\gamma}, which grows with system size but with a nonuniversal scaling exponent, {\gamma} &lt; 1/2. In contrast to fractal quasicondensates obtained when the chemical potential lies in a region of multifractal single-particle states, placing the chemical potential in regions of localized or delocalized states yields, respectively, no condensation or the usual 1D quasicondensation with {\gamma} = 1/2. Our findings are established by studying one-dimensional hardcore bosons subjected to various quasiperiodic potentials, including the well-known Aubry-Andre model, employing a mapping to non-interacting fermionics that allows for numerically exact results. We discuss how to test our findings in state-of-the-art ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A field theory for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is developed in details. The central equation of this theory is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance. This equation determines the transmission eigenvalue distribution not only in the diffusive regime but also in the quasiballistic regime, where the radiance is expected to be significantly anisotropic in the material bulk. We show that the matrix transport equation can be solved analytically in this regime. We also show that, in addition to the finite-width waveguide, our equation is able to predict the transmission eigenvalue distribution through an infinite slab.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a field theory to characterize the mean distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through a disordered medium. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which assumes uniform field intensity across scattering channels. As a result, it accurately predicts the transmission eigenvalue distribution both in the diffusive and quasiballistic regime. In addition, it proves to be more versatile than the DMPK theory, allowing for the incorporation of physical effects such as absorption or partial channel control with minimal adjustments to the formalism. Although these effects are commonly encountered in experiments on complex media, until now there has been no ab initio theory addressing them. Our predictions are numerically validated against transmission eigenvalue distributions computed from the microscopic wave equation.</description>
