      <title>When LLMs Disagree: Diagnosing Relevance Filtering Bias and Retrieval Divergence in SDG Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns, produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.</description>

      <title>Assembling ensembling: An adventure in approaches across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we think of model ensembling or ensemble modeling, there are many possibilities that come to mind in different disciplines. For example, one might think of a set of descriptions of a phenomenon in the world, perhaps a time series or a snapshot of multivariate space, and perhaps that set is comprised of data-independent descriptions, or perhaps it is quite intentionally fit *to* data, or even a suite of data sets with a common theme or intention. The very meaning of 'ensemble' - a collection together - conjures different ideas across and even within disciplines approaching phenomena. In this paper, we present a typology of the scope of these potential perspectives. It is not our goal to present a review of terms and concepts, nor is it to convince all disciplines to adopt a common suite of terms, which we view as futile. Rather, our goal is to disambiguate terms, concepts, and processes associated with 'ensembles' and 'ensembling' in order to facilitate communication, awareness, and possible adoption of tools across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Delving into LLM-assisted writing in biomedical publications through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in over 15 million biomedical abstracts from 2010--2024 indexed by PubMed, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>
