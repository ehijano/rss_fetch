      <title>Polynomial integrable systems from cluster structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing polynomial integrable systems with respect to linearizations of Poisson varieties that admit log-canonical coordinate systems. Our construction is in particular applicable to Poisson varieties with compatible cluster or generalized cluster structures. As examples, we consider an arbitrary standard complex semi-simple Poisson Lie group $G$ with the Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster structure, nilpotent Lie subgroups of $G$ associated to elements of the Weyl group of $G$, identified with Schubert cells in the flag variety of $G$ and equipped with the standard cluster structure (defined by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer in the simply-laced case), and the dual Poisson Lie group of ${\rm GL}(n, \mathbb C)$ with the Gekhtman-Shapiro-Vainshtein generalized cluster structure. In each of the three cases, we show that every extended cluster in the respective cluster structure gives rise to a polynomial integrable system on the respective Lie algebra with respect to the linearization of the Poisson structure at the identity element. For some of the integrable systems thus obtained, we further show that all their Hamiltonian flows are complete.</description>

      <title>On the degenerate Arnold conjecture on $\mathbb T^{2m}\times \mathbb C\mathbb P^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960s Arnold conjectured that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed connected symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ should have at least as many contractible fixed points as a smooth function on $M$ has critical points. Such a conjecture can be seen as a natural generalization of Poincar\'e's last geometric theorem and is one of the most famous (and still nowadays open in its full generality) problems in symplectic geometry. In this paper, we build on a recent approach of the authors and Izydorek to the Arnold conjecture on $\mathbb C\mathbb P^n$ to show that the (degenerate) Arnold conjecture holds for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms $\phi$ of $\mathbb T^{2m}\times \mathbb C\mathbb P^n$, $m,n\geq 1$, which are $C^0$-close to the identity in the $\mathbb C \mathbb P^n$-direction, namely that any such $\phi$ has at least $\text{CL}(\mathbb T^{2m}\times \mathbb C\mathbb P^n)+1= 2m+n+1$ contractible fixed points.</description>

      <title>Non-orderability and the contact Hofer norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate non-orderability in contact topology to shortening in the contact Hofer norm. Combined with considerations of open books, this provides many new examples of non-orderable contact manifolds, including contact boundaries of subcritical Weinstein domains, and in particular the long-standing case of the standard $S^1 \times S^2.$ We also produce new examples of contact manifolds admitting contactomorphisms without translated points, provide obstructions to subcritical polarizations of symplectic manifolds, and establish a $\mathcal{C}^0$-continuity property of the contact Hofer metric.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We determine the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ in terms of certain maximal root subsystems described by Borel-de Siebenthal theory. We prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ is equidimensional, and we prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety. As a consequence, we find an affine paving of $\bar{\mathfrak h}$, and when $\mathfrak g$ is classical, we determine the number of strata in each dimension in terms of Stirling numbers and their variants, thereby computing the Betti numbers of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ In the general case, we relate the order relation on strata given by closures of strata to the poset of hyperplane arrangements studied by Orlik and Solomon, and determine the cup product in the cohomology of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ Our work has similarities to results of Braden et al \cite{BHMPW} on matroid Schubert varieties, but the connection to root systems facilitates greater precision in some of our results.</description>
