      <title>Automated Retinal Image Analysis and Medical Report Generation through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (2) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (3) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

      <title>3D Gaussian Editing with A Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling and manipulation of 3D scenes captured from the real world are pivotal in various applications, attracting growing research interest. While previous works on editing have achieved interesting results through manipulating 3D meshes, they often require accurately reconstructed meshes to perform editing, which limits their application in 3D content generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editing approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation via directly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimize the 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from a user-specified viewpoint of the original scene. To capture long-range object deformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization. To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, we build an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintaining structural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy to adaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in handling geometric details, long-range, and non-rigid deformation, demonstrating superior editing flexibility and quality compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Semantic-centric Video-based Multimodal Affective Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), understanding human's affection is essential to enhance machine's cognition abilities. For achieving more sensual human-AI interaction, Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) in human-spoken videos has attracted increasing attention. However, previous methods are mainly devoted to designing multimodal fusion algorithms, suffering from two issues: semantic imbalance caused by diverse pre-processing operations and semantic mismatch raised by inconsistent affection content contained in different modalities comparing with the multimodal ground truth. Besides, the usage of manual features extractors make they fail in building end-to-end pipeline for multiple MAC downstream tasks. To address above challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named SemanticMAC to compute multimodal semantic-centric affection for human-spoken videos. We firstly employ pre-trained Transformer model in multimodal data pre-processing and design Affective Perceiver module to capture unimodal affective information. Moreover, we present a semantic-centric approach to unify multimodal representation learning in three ways, including gated feature interaction, multi-task pseudo label generation, and intra-/inter-sample contrastive learning. Finally, SemanticMAC effectively learn specific- and shared-semantic representations in the guidance of semantic-centric labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpass the state-of-the-art methods on 7 public datasets in four MAC downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Sketch-Aware Interpolation Network for High-Quality Animation Sketch Inbetweening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hand-drawn 2D animation workflow is typically initiated with the creation of sketch keyframes. Subsequent manual inbetweens are crafted for smoothness, which is a labor-intensive process and the prospect of automatic animation sketch interpolation has become highly appealing. Yet, common frame interpolation methods are generally hindered by two key issues: 1) limited texture and colour details in sketches, and 2) exaggerated alterations between two sketch keyframes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep learning method - Sketch-Aware Interpolation Network (SAIN). This approach incorporates multi-level guidance that formulates region-level correspondence, stroke-level correspondence and pixel-level dynamics. A multi-stream U-Transformer is then devised to characterize sketch inbetweening patterns using these multi-level guides through the integration of self / cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, to facilitate future research on animation sketch inbetweening, we constructed a large-scale dataset - STD-12K, comprising 30 sketch animation series in diverse artistic styles. Comprehensive experiments on this dataset convincingly show that our proposed SAIN surpasses the state-of-the-art interpolation methods.</description>

      <title>Lost in Overlap: Exploring Watermark Collision in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in generating content raises concerns about text copyright. Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread usage of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks, such as paraphrasing or translation. In this paper, we introduce watermark collision as a novel and general philosophy for watermark attacks, aimed at enhancing attack performance on top of any other attacking methods. We also provide a comprehensive demonstration that watermark collision poses a threat to all logit-based watermark algorithms, impacting not only specific attack scenarios but also downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting Audio-Visual Deepfakes with Fine-Grained Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods on audio-visual deepfake detection mainly focus on high-level features for modeling inconsistencies between audio and visual data. As a result, these approaches usually overlook finer audio-visual artifacts, which are inherent to deepfakes. Herein, we propose the introduction of fine-grained mechanisms for detecting subtle artifacts in both spatial and temporal domains. First, we introduce a local audio-visual model capable of capturing small spatial regions that are prone to inconsistencies with audio. For that purpose, a fine-grained mechanism based on a spatially-local distance coupled with an attention module is adopted. Second, we introduce a temporally-local pseudo-fake augmentation to include samples incorporating subtle temporal inconsistencies in our training set. Experiments on the DFDC and the FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of generalization as compared to the state-of-the-art under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings.</description>
