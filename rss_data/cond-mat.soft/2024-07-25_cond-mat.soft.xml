      <title>Cooperative lattice theory for CO2 adsorption in diamine-appended metal organic framework at humid direct air capture conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of humidity on the cooperative adsorption of CO2 from air on amine appended metal organic frameworks is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Breakthrough experiments show that at low relative humidities there is an anomalous induction effect, where the kinetics at short times are slower than kinetics at long times. The induction effect gradually vanishes as relative humidity is increased, corresponding to an increase in CO2 adsorption rate. A new theory is proposed based on the Lattice Kinetic Theory (LKT) which explains these experimental results. LKT is able to accurately represent the measured data over the full range of humidities by postulating that the presence of adsorbed water shifts the equilibrium clusters from cooperatively bound chains to non-cooperatively bound CO2. A consequence of this transition is that CO2 exhibits type V adsorption in dry air, and type I adsorption in humid air.</description>

      <title>Reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a melt of Kremer-Grest type model under fast shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulation method has been widely employed, the range of applicability is yet to be discussed. In this study, for the first time, we systematically examine the method against an unentangled melt of the Kremer-Grest type chain. The simulation results indicate that as the shear rate increases, the temperature and density become inhomogeneous. However, the average viscosity remains consistent with the results obtained using the SLLOD method under homogeneous temperature and density. We also confirm that the temperature-density inhomogeneity does not significantly affect polymer conformation.</description>

      <title>Active particles confined in deformable droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles under soft confinement such as droplets or vesicles present intriguing phenomena, as collective motion emerges alongside the deformation of the environment. A model is employed to systematically investigate droplet morphology and particle distribution in relation to activity and concentration,revealing that active particles have the capacity to induce enhanced shape fluctuations in the droplet interface with respect to the thermal fluctuations, aligning with recent experimental observations. A rich phase behaviour can be identified with two different mechanism of droplet breakage.</description>

      <title>A one-component patchy-particle icosahedral quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing particles that are able to form icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) and that are as simple as possible is not only of fundamental interest but is also important to the potential realization of IQCs in materials other than metallic alloys. Here we introduce one-component patchy-particle systems that in simulations are able to form face-centred IQCs that are made up of interconnected icosahedra. The directional bonding of the particles facilitates the formation of a network of bonds with icosahedral orientational order and hence quasiperiodic positional order. The assembled quasicrystals have similar energies to periodic approximants but are entropically stabilized by phason disorder. Their long-range quasiperiodic order is confirmed by a higher-dimensional analysis. Promising routes to realize these IQCs experimentally include via protein design and DNA origami particles.</description>

      <title>Stochastic density functional theory for ions in a polar solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory applied to pressure-controlled shear flows of frictionless spheres between rigid, bumpy planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate, through discrete element simulations, the steady flow of identical, frictionless spheres sheared between two parallel, bumpy planes in the absence of gravity and under a fixed normal load. We measure the spatial distributions of solid volume fraction, mean velocity, intensity of agitation and stresses, and confirm previous results on the validity of the equation of state and the viscosity predicted by the kinetic theory of granular gases. In a first, we also directly measure the spatial distributions of the diffusivity and the rate of collisional dissipation of the fluctuation kinetic energy, and successfully test the associated constitutive relations of the kinetic theory. We then phrase and numerically integrate a system of differential equations governing the flow, with suitable boundary conditions, and show a remarkable qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of the discrete simulations in terms of the dependence of the profiles of the hydrodynamic fields, the ratio of shear stress-to-pressure and the gap between the bumpy planes on the coefficient of collisional restitution, the imposed load and the bumpiness of the planes. Finally, we propose a criterion to predict, on the basis of the solution of the boundary-valued problem, the critical value of the imposed load above which crystallization may occur. This notably reproduces what we observe in the discrete simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluids with power-law repulsion: Hyperuniformity and energy fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the equilibrium statistical mechanics of a classical fluid of point-like particles with repulsive power-law pair interactions, focusing on density and energy fluctuations. Such long-range interactions, decaying with inter-particle distance $r$ as $1/r^s$ in $d$ dimensions, are known to fall into two qualitatively different categories. For $s&lt;d$ ("strongly" long-range interactions) there are screening of correlations and suppression of large-wavelength density fluctuations (hyperuniformity). These effects eliminate density modes with arbitrarily large energy. For $s&gt;d$ ("weakly" long-range interactions) screening and hyperuniformity do not occur. Using scaling arguments, variational analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, we find another qualitative distinction. For $s \geq d/2$ the strong repulsion at short distances suppresses small-wavelength density fluctuations. This "small-scale hyperuniformity" prevents indefinitely negative entropy and large energy fluctuations. The distinct behaviors for $s \geq d/2$ and $s&lt;d/2$ give rise to qualitatively different dependencies of the entropy, heat capacity, and energy fluctuations on temperature and density. We investigate the effect of introducing an upper cutoff distance in the pair-potential. The effect of the cutoff on energy fluctuations is strong for $s&lt;d/2$ and negligible for $s \geq d/2$.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Field Theory for Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformation, defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>

      <title>Learning a phenomenological theory for contact-interactions between motile cells from collision experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on eleven candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, shape, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>

      <title>Physical limits on galvanotaxis depends on cell morphology and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galvanotaxis is believed to be driven by the redistribution of transmembrane proteins and other molecules, referred to as "sensors", through electrophoresis and electroosmosis. Here, we update our previous model of the limits of galvanotaxis due to stochasticity of sensor movements to account for cell shape and orientation. Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in principle possess more information about the electric field direction when their long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields maximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower variability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field. In an alternate possibility, we find that if cells instead estimate the field direction by taking the average of all the sensor locations as its directional cue ("vector sum"), this introduces a bias towards the short axis, an effect not present for isotropic cells. We also explore the possibility that cell elongation arises downstream of sensor redistribution. We argue that if sensors migrate to the cell's rear, the cell will expand perpendicular the field - as is more commonly observed - but if sensors migrate to the front, the cell will elongate parallel to the field.</description>

      <title>Localized jammed clusters persist in shear-thickening suspension subjected to swirling excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic evolution of heterogeneity in shear-thickening suspensions subjected to swirling excitation with a free surface. The uniform state of such a system may lose its stability when the oscillation frequency is above a threshold, and density waves spontaneously form (Shi \textit{et al.} JFM 2024). Here, we report a novel state where jammed clusters emerge in high-density region of the density waves. The jammed cluster exhibits unique motion, creating downstream high-density regions distinct from previously reported state of density waves. Additionally, theoretical calculations show that reducing suspension thickness lowers the frequency and global concentration $\Phi$ threshold for the heterogeneity onset. Notably, the minimal $\Phi$ for instability can be lower than the onset of discontinuous shear thickening transition. We also highlight the role of the free surface in cluster growth and persistence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembly of particles at fluid-fluid interfaces is a widespread phenomenon. Over time, researchers have explored various intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to modulate and direct these processes. This review article focuses on how external fields, specifically electric and magnetic fields, can control the self-assembly of mesoscopic particles at interfaces. By adjusting particle shape and size, attractive forces can be finely tuned. Additionally, the strength and direction of external fields significantly influence the final assembled structure. These systems offer promising potential for innovative applications in drug delivery, catalysis, and other transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Breaking of a floating particle raft by water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When particles of a few tens of microns are spread on the surface of water, they aggregate under the action of capillary forces and form a thin floating membrane, a particle raft. In a tank with a raft made of graphite powder, we generate in the laboratory gravity surface waves, whose wavelength {about 17 cm} is very large compared to the thickness of the raft {of order 10 microns}. For a sufficiently strong wave amplitude, the raft breaks up progressively by developing cracks and producing fragments whose sizes decrease on a time scale long compared to the period of the wave. We characterize the breaking mechanisms. Then, we investigate the area distribution of the fragments produced during the fragmentation process. The visual appearance of the fragments distributed in size and surrounded by open water bears a {notable} resemblance to the floes produced by the fracturing of sea ice by waves in the polar oceans. Fragmentation concepts and morphological tools built for sea ice floes can be applied to our macroscopic analog, on which the entire dynamic evolution is accessible. {However, the mechanic of the two systems differ, as our particle raft breaks due to the viscous stresses, whereas the sea-ice fractures due its bending by the waves.</description>
