      <title>Low-Dose CT Imaging Using a Regularization-Enhanced Efficient Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces patient radiation exposure but introduces substantial noise that degrades image quality and hinders diagnostic accuracy. Existing denoising approaches often require many diffusion steps, limiting real-time applicability. We propose a Regularization-Enhanced Efficient Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RE-EDPM), a rapid and high-fidelity LDCT denoising framework that integrates a residual shifting mechanism to align low-dose and full-dose distributions and performs only four reverse diffusion steps using a Swin-based U-Net backbone. A composite loss combining pixel reconstruction, perceptual similarity (LPIPS), and total variation (TV) regularization effectively suppresses spatially varying noise while preserving anatomical structures. RE-EDPM was evaluated on a public LDCT benchmark across dose levels and anatomical sites. On 10 percent dose chest and 25 percent dose abdominal scans, it achieved SSIM = 0.879 (0.068), PSNR = 31.60 (2.52) dB, VIFp = 0.366 (0.121) for chest, and SSIM = 0.971 (0.000), PSNR = 36.69 (2.54) dB, VIFp = 0.510 (0.007) for abdomen. Visual and statistical analyses, including ablation and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (p &lt; 0.05), confirm significant contributions from residual shifting and regularization terms. RE-EDPM processes two 512x512 slices in about 0.25 s on modern GPUs, supporting near real-time clinical use. The proposed framework achieves an optimal balance between noise suppression and anatomical fidelity, offering an efficient solution for LDCT restoration and broader medical image enhancement tasks.</description>

      <title>Predicting Wrist Osteoporosis from excised human finger bones using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy, A Cadaveric Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osteoporosis and osteopenia remain vastly underdiagnosed. Current clinical screening relies almost exclusively on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which measures bone mineral density (BMD) but fails to capture the compositional changes that lead to BMD loss. We investigated whether Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) applied to excised finger bones can assess subsurface biochemical markers capable of diagnosing osteoporosis and osteopenia and predicting wrist DXA T-scores. Raman spectra were acquired ex vivo on the mid-shaft of the proximal phalanx of the second digit from 25 female cadavers spanning the three T-score categories (n=8 normal, n=6 osteopenic, and n=11 osteoporotic) at spatial offsets of 0, 3, and 6 mm from a laser irradiation spot. After normalizing spectra to the PO43- peak, group-averaged spectra of the three categories, measured at 3-mm offset, showed clear differences in the CO32-, Amide III, CH2, and Amide I bands. Quantitatively, four out of five mineral-to-matrix ratios differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) between normal and osteopenic bone, and between osteopenic and osteoporotic bone, and all five ratios showed significant differences between normal and osteoporotic bone. In contrast, the 0-mm offset suffered diminished contrast, and the 6-mm offset did not enhance discrimination between different groups, compared with the 3-mm offset. A leave-one-out, partial-least-squares regression model built from the 3-mm spectra predicted distal radius DXA T-score with a Pearson correlation of r = 0.85 and a root-mean-square error of cross-validation of 1 T-score units, correctly classifying 92% of specimens.</description>

      <title>A GPU-based Monte Carlo framework for IMRT QA using EPID transit dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We presented a GPU-based MC framework, ARCHER-EPID, specifically designed for EPID transit dosimetry, with improving accuracy and efficiency. Methods: A comprehensive MC framework was developed to perform full radiation transport simulations through three distinct zones: a detailed linear accelerator head model, a CT-based patient/phantom geometry, and a realistic, multi-layered EPID model. To convert the simulated absorbed dose to a realistic detector signal, a dose-response correction model was implemented. The framework was validated by comparing simulations against experimental measurements for 25 IMRT fields delivered to both a solid water phantom and a anthropomorphic phantom. Agreement was quantified using Gamma analysis. Results: The GPU-accelerated ARCHER-EPID framework can complete the simulation for a complex IMRT field in about 90 seconds. A 2D correction factor lookup table is generated by parameterizing radiological thickness and effective field size to account for the EPID's energy-dependent response. The data revealed that for small fields, beam hardening is the dominant effect, while for large fields, the contribution from patient-generated scatter overwhelms this effect. The average 2D gamma passing rates (3%/3 mm criteria) between simulation and measurements are 98.43% for the solid water phantom and 97.86% for the anthropomorphic phantom, respectively. Visual comparison of the images and dose profiles between simulation and measurements show a high degree of agreement. Conclusions: We have successfully developed and validated a GPU-based MC framework that provides gold-standard accuracy for EPID transit dosimetry in radiotherapy. The results demonstrate that our proposed method has potential for routine application in PSQA.</description>

      <title>Cluster Dose Prediction in Carbon Ion Therapy: Using Transfer Learning from a Pretrained Dose Prediction U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cluster dose concept offers an alternative to the radiobiological effectiveness (RBE)-based model for describing radiation-induced biological effects. This study examines the application of a neural network to predict cluster dose distributions, with the goal of replacing the computationally intensive simulations currently required. Cluster dose distributions are predicted using a U-Net that was initially pretrained on conventional dose distributions. Using transfer learning techniques, the decoder path is adapted for cluster dose estimation. Both the training and pretraining datasets include head and neck regions from multiple patients and carbon ion beams of varying energies and positions. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were used to generate the ground truth cluster dose distributions. The U-Net enables cluster dose estimation for a single pencil beam within milliseconds using a graphics processing unit (GPU). The predicted cluster dose distributions deviate from the ground truth by less than 0.35%. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately estimating cluster doses within clinically acceptable computation times using machine learning (ML). By leveraging a pretrained neural network and applying transfer learning techniques, the approach significantly reduces the need for large-scale, computationally expensive training data.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Colorimetric Sensing: Achieving over 5700-fold Accuracy Improvement via Full-Spectrum Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional colorimetric sensing methods typically rely on signal intensity at a single wavelength, often selected heuristically based on peak visual modulation. This approach overlooks the structured information embedded in full-spectrum transmission profiles, particularly in intensity-based systems where linear models may be highly effective. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that applying a forward feature selection strategy to normalized transmission spectra, combined with linear regression and ten-fold cross-validation, yields significant improvements in predictive accuracy. Using food dye dilutions as a model system, the mean squared error was reduced from over 22,000 with a single wavelength to 3.87 using twelve selected features, corresponding to a more than 5,700-fold enhancement. These results validate that full-spectrum modeling enables precise concentration prediction without requiring changes to the sensing hardware. The approach is broadly applicable to colorimetric assays used in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and industrial analysis, offering a scalable pathway to improve sensitivity and reliability in existing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review discusses the current applications, advantages, and limitations of PBPK and PopPK models in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). PBPK models simulate radiopharmaceutical kinetics by integrating prior physiological and drug parameter information, whereas PopPK models leverage population data to enhance individual dose estimation accuracy. Future directions include developing hybrid models, incorporating artificial intelligence, and establishing regulatory guidelines to promote their clinical adoption. Ultimately, these modeling strategies aim to enable precise, personalized RPT dosing, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and safety.</description>

      <title>Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models for Theranostic Digital Twins: Towards Reliable Model-Informed Treatment Planning for Radiopharmaceutical Therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models provide a mechanistic framework for simulating radiopharmaceutical kinetics and estimating patient-specific absorbed doses (ADs). PBPK models incorporate prior knowledge of patient physiology and drug-specific properties, which can enhance the models predictive performance. PBPK models can ultimately be used to predict treatment response and thereby enable theranostic digital twins (TDTs) for personalized treatment planning in radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). To achieve this potential of precision RPT, however, the reliability of the underlying modeling, including the PBPK-based dosimetry, must be established through rigorous verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ). This review outlines the role of VVUQ in ensuring the credibility and clinical applicability of PBPK models in radiotheranostics. Key methodologies for PBPK model VVUQ are discussed, including goodness-of-fit (GOF) assessment, prediction evaluation, and uncertainty propagation.</description>

      <title>Measuring multi-site pulse transit time with an AI-enabled mmWave radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is a measure of arterial stiffness and a physiological marker associated with cardiovascular function, with an inverse relationship to diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We present the first AI-enabled mmWave system for contactless multi-site PTT measurement using a single radar. By leveraging radar beamforming and deep learning algorithms our system simultaneously measures PTT and estimates diastolic blood pressure at multiple sites. The system was evaluated across three physiological pathways - heart-to-radial artery, heart-to-carotid artery, and mastoid area-to-radial artery -- achieving correlation coefficients of 0.73-0.89 compared to contact-based reference sensors for measuring PTT. Furthermore, the system demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.90-0.92 for estimating DBP, and achieved a mean error of -1.00-0.62 mmHg and standard deviation of 4.97-5.70 mmHg, meeting the FDA's AAMI guidelines for non-invasive blood pressure monitors. These results suggest that our proposed system has the potential to provide a non-invasive measure of cardiovascular health across multiple regions of the body.</description>

      <title>Radiation enhanced diffusion in cartilages as a physical mechanism underlying radiation treatments of osteoarthritis and related disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</description>

      <title>Servo navigation and phase equalization enhanced by run-time stabilization (PEERS) for 3D EPI time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To enhance time-resolved segmented imaging by synergy of run-time stabilization and retrospective, data-driven phase correction. Methods: A segmented 3D EPI sequence for fMRI time series is equipped with servo navigation based on short orbital navigators and a linear perturbation model, enabling run-time correction for rigid-body motion as well as bulk phase and frequency fluctuation. Complementary retrospective phase correction is based on the repetitive structure of the time series and serves to address residual phase and frequency offsets. The combined approach is termed phase equalization enhanced by run-time stabilization (PEERS). Results: The proposed strategy is evaluated in a phantom and in-vivo. Servo navigation is found to diminish motion confound in raw data and maintain k-space consistency over time series. In turn, retrospective phase equalization is found to eliminate shot-wise phase and frequency offsets relative to the navigator, which are attributed to eddy-currents and vibrations from phase encoding. Retrospective phase equalization reduces the precision requirements for run-time frequency control, supporting the use of short navigators. Relative to conventional volume realignment, PEERS achieved tSNR improvements up to $30\%$ for small motion and in the order of $10\%$ when volunteers tried to hold still. Retrospective phase equalization is found to clearly outperform phase correction based solely on navigator-based frequency estimates. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision run-time motion correction for 3D EPI fMRI. Coarse frequency tracking based on short navigators is supplemented by precise retrospective frequency and phase correction. Fully automatic and self-calibrated, PEERS offers effective plug-and-play motion and phase correction for 3D fMRI.</description>
