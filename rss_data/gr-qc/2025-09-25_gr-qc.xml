      <title>Optical signatures of wormholes immersed in realistic dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an exact analytic framework for massless scalar-wave propagation in static, spherically symmetric wormholes embedded in realistic dark matter halos. Starting from a general line element with arbitrary redshift and shape functions, we derive the radial Klein-Gordon equation in Schr\"odinger form, disentangling the effects of gravitational redshift, spatial curvature, and angular momentum. The dynamics reduce to a generalized Helmholtz equation with a space- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index that encodes throat geometry, halo curvature, and centrifugal contributions. In the asymptotic limit $r \to \infty$, the refractive index approaches unity, consistently recovering free-space propagation. Application to representative halo profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White model, the Thomas-Fermi Bose-Einstein condensate, and the Pseudo-Isothermal distribution, combined with zero, Teo-type, and cored redshift functions, reveals evanescent domains, quasi-bound states, and suppression of high-angular-momentum modes near the throat. High-frequency waves converge to the geometric-optics regime, whereas low-frequency modes undergo strong curvature-induced localization. This formalism establishes a non-perturbative link between wormhole geometry, halo structure, and redshift effects, providing a robust framework for scalar-wave phenomenology in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Splitting the Gravitational Atom: Instabilities of Black Holes with Synchronized/Resonant Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm, linking superradiance from ultralight fields -- creating gravitational atoms -- to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ''very hairy'' regime, where a small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.</description>

      <title>A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass-ratio inspirals around non-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Could regular primordial black holes be dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent proposal proposed by Paul Davies and colleagues [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore, low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Data-driven extraction and phenomenology of eccentric harmonics in eccentric spinning binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newtonian and post-Newtonian (PN) calculations indicate that the phenomenology of eccentric binary black hole (BBH) merger waveforms is significantly more complex than that of their quasi-circular counterparts. Each spherical harmonic mode of the radiation can be further decomposed into several eccentricity-induced components, referred to as eccentric harmonics. Unlike the (cumulative) spherical harmonic modes, these constituent eccentric harmonics exhibit monotonically time-varying amplitudes and frequencies. However, these eccentric harmonics are not directly accessible in numerical relativity (NR) simulations or current eccentric waveform models. Using the recently developed data-driven framework gwMiner, which combines singular value decomposition, input from post-Newtonian theory, and signal processing techniques, we extract eccentric harmonics from eccentric, aligned-spin waveforms for six different spherical harmonic modes: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). We demonstrate that the phase (frequency) of each eccentric harmonic takes the form $j\,\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda} + \phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ ($j\,f_{\ell,m,\lambda} + f_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$), where $\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda}$ ($f_{\ell,m,\lambda}$) corresponds to the secular orbital phase (frequency), and $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ ($f_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$) is an additional contribution that depends solely on the eccentricity. We further find that $\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda}$ is the same across different spherical harmonic modes $(\ell, m)$, whereas the eccentric correction term $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ scales with $\ell$. Using effective-one-body dynamics, we further show that $\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda}$ is nothing but the relativistic anomaly and $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ is related to the precession advances.</description>

      <title>Exact Kerr--Schild spacetimes from linearized kinetic gravity braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize our recent work on k-essence sourcing Kerr--Schild spacetimes to kinetic gravity braiding scalar field. For k-essence, in order a perturbative Kerr--Schild type solution to become exact, the k-essence Lagrangian was either linear in the kinetic term (with the Kerr--Schild congruence autoparallel) or unrestricted, provided the scalar gradient along the congruence vanishes. A similar reasoning for the pure kinetic braiding contribution leads to either a vanishing Lagrangian or a scalar which is constant along the congruence. From the scalar dynamics we also derive an accompanying constraint. Finally, we discuss pp-waves, an example of Kerr--Schild spacetime generated by a constant k-essence along the Kerr--Schild congruence with vanishing Lagrangian. This allows for the construction of a Fock-type space, consisting of a tower of Kerr--Schild maps first yielding a vacuum pp-wave from flat spacetime; next a k-essence generated pp-wave from the vacuum pp-wave; and finally an arbitrary number of k-essence pp-waves with different, retarded time dependent metric functions.</description>

      <title>Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Desclarizing the Wormhole to Black Hole with Negative Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new black holes using the curvature-induced scalarization mechanism in Einstein gravity coupled to a massless phantom scalar. We find that the general wormhole solutions with independent scalar charge become descalarized so that the resulting black hole scalar hair becomes secondary and a function of the mass only. The long-range force between the two identical black holes can be attractive, zero or repulsive, depending on the mass/scalar charge relation. Furthermore, the black hole mass can be negative. Our finding suggests that exotic matter responsible for wormholes can also lead to exotic black holes.</description>

      <title>Teleportation-based filtering for gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the principle of quantum teleportation in gravitational-wave detectors provides a method to address technical challenges associated with implementing quantum filters for squeezed-light injection. A recent proposal has shown that an arbitrary number of effective squeezing-angle rotations can be achieved by cascading quantum teleportation, yielding sensitivity equivalent to frequency-dependent pre-filtering. A natural question is whether the teleportation-based protocol can also realize frequency-dependent post-filtering. In this work, we examine this possibility and show that, with perfect teleportation fidelity, post-filtering can be fully implemented. In practice, however, various imperfections make the sensitivity nearly equivalent to that of teleportation-based pre-filtering. We apply this scheme to the low-frequency detector in the Einstein Telescope xylophone configuration and find that teleportation-based post-filtering could also be a candidate for the detector's design.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics of Matter Creation with Modified Chaplygin Gas and Bulk Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive investigation of a novel cosmological model that unifies the Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) equation of state with gravitationally induced matter creation and bulk viscous dissipation in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The MCG fluid is characterized by an exotic equation of state $p = A\rho - C/\rho^\alpha$, while the matter creation rate is taken as $\Gamma = 3\beta H$ and the bulk viscous pressure as $\pi = -3H\xi_0 \rho_m^{1/2}$. We derive the modified Friedmann equations and obtain an analytical expression for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, which is then used to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of key cosmological parameters: the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, jerk parameter $j(z)$, and snap parameter $s(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using two observational datasets: DS1 (Pantheon+ + Cosmic Chronometers + DESI BAO + $\sigma_8$) and DS2 (DS1 + R22), employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The results indicate that the proposed hybrid model successfully generates a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion, consistent with current observations. Notably, the inclusion of R22 data leads to a higher best-fit value of $H_0$, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we perform a rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the model by testing the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics. We compute the total entropy rate of change $\dot{S}_{\text{total}} = \dot{S}_{\text{fluid}} + \dot{S}_{\text{horizon}}$, finding it positive throughout cosmic history for both datasets, confirming the model's thermodynamic viability. The second derivative $\ddot{S}_{\text{total}}$ exhibits a clear transition from positive to negative values around $z \sim 1$, indicating a shift from accelerating to decelerating entropy production a signature of late-time thermodynamic stabilization.</description>

      <title>Waveform stability for the piecewise step approximation of Regge-Wheeler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By interpreting the difference between the original Regge-Wheeler potential and its piecewise step approximation as perturbative effects induced by the external environment of the black hole, we investigate the stability of Schwarzschild black hole time-domain waveforms. In this work, we employ the Green's function method under the assumption of an observer at spatial infinity to obtain the waveform. For two cases in which the initial Gaussian bump near the event horizon or at spatial infinity, we derive analytic expressions for the corresponding waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the waveform is indeed insensitive to tiny modifications of the effective potential, thereby confirming its stability. More importantly, we find that broader initial bumps imprint the influence of small environmental modifications more clearly on the waveform, which may provide theoretical guidance for probing the exterior environment of black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes formation in inflationary $F(R)$ models with scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Charged Black-Hole Binary Evolution at Second Post-Newtonian Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of electrically charged black-hole binaries and their gravitational-wave emission during the inspiral phase. Within the post-Newtonian framework, we derive the conservative and dissipative dynamics up to second order (2PN), combining Effective Field Theory and classical methods. We compute the NNLO conservative Lagrangian, LO dissipative effects in harmonic and Lorenz gauges, and provide the equations of motion, center-of-mass transformations, and the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian in ADM-type coordinates. We also obtain gauge-invariant expressions for the binding energy, periastron advance in quasi-circular orbits, and the scattering angle in unbound orbits. Our results extend previous analyses and are fully consistent with recent post-Minkowskian findings.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that $n$-way junctions in three dimensional gravity correspond to coupled $n-1$ strings each satisfying the Nambu-Goto equation in the smoothened background, and with sources consisting of Monge-Amp\`{e}re like terms which couple the strings. For $n\geq 3$, these $n-1$ degrees of freedom survive the tensionless limit implying that matter-like behavior can arise out of $pure$ gravity. We interpret these stringy degrees of freedom of gravitational junctions holographically in terms of wavepackets which collectively undergo perfect reflection at the multi-interface in the dual conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetrized operators or modified integration measure in Generalized Uncertainty Principle Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models modify the inner-product measure to ensure symmetric position or momentum operators. We show that an alternate approach to these GUPs is to symmetrize the operators rather than modifying the inner product. This preserves the standard momentum space allowing the eigenstates and maximally localized states of the modified position operator to have a standard position representation. We compare both approaches and highlight their merits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Freelance Holography Program, an extension of the AdS/CFT correspondence within the saddle-point approximation that opens several novel directions. This framework generalizes holography beyond the asymptotic AdS boundary, allowing it to be formulated on arbitrary timelike hypersurfaces in the bulk. Moreover, it accommodates arbitrary boundary conditions for bulk fields, moving beyond the standard Dirichlet prescription. As part of this development, we construct a one-parameter family of renormalized boundary conditions that, unlike conventional choices in the literature, lead to a finite on-shell action. We also explore intriguing consequences of the framework, including the emergence of induced gravity and the flow of boundary conditions under holographic renormalization.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Planck Relics are Ruled-Out as Dark Matter by LIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO's upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Passive UV-Based System for Discharging the Test Masses of Ground Based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a passive ultraviolet charge management system for the fused silica test masses in ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The system uses photoelectron emission from low work-function gold coatings illuminated by 275 to 285 nm UV light to neutralize unwanted electric charges on the electrically floating test masses, maintaining them at zero potential relative to surrounding components. Two implementation schemes are described: 1. distributed discharge tabs illuminated by UV LEDs mounted at the eight surrounding earthquake stops, and 2. a conductively linked tab design enabling a centralized discharge on the test mass barrel, with potential extension to annular coatings around the high-reflectivity and anti-reflective surfaces. Experimental results show photoelectric currents greater or equal to 10 pA for 1.0 mW of incident UV, enabling discharge rates greater than 10V/s for a 1 pF capacitance. With 0.2 mW UV power, charge neutralization to less or equal to 1 pC can be achieved in 5 to 75 minutes. This technique offers a vacuum-compatible alternative to ion sprayers, significantly reducing operational downtime. For the conductive-barrel configuration, we also propose a balanced electrostatic actuator using four parallel-plate capacitors for combined control of TM axial displacement, tilt, and azimuth, with reduced drive voltages.</description>

      <title>Holographic Brownian dynamics of a heavy particle in a boosted thermal plasma background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have performed a detailed holographic analysis of the stochastic dynamics of a heavy quark propagating through a strongly coupled plasma moving with a constant velocity along a fixed spatial direction. To model this scenario within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider a boosted AdS black brane geometry in the bulk. The boost corresponds to the uniform motion of the plasma on the boundary field theory side. The presence of this boost introduces a preferred direction, leading to an anisotropic environment in which the behavior of the quark differs depending on its direction of motion. Consequently, we examine two distinct cases, namely, quark motion parallel to the direction of the boost and motion perpendicular to it. In this work we have computed the diffusion coefficient for both along the boost and perpendicular to the boost directions. We have obtained the diffusion coefficient by following the two different approaches in both the cases. These complementary approaches yield consistent results, thereby reinforcing the reliability of the computations carried out. Additionally, we derive and verify the fluctuation-dissipation relation within this anisotropic setup, confirming its validity in both longitudinal and transverse channels. Our findings provide deeper insight into the non-equilibrium transport properties of strongly coupled plasma and further elucidate the holographic description of Brownian motion in anisotropic backgrounds. Then we have moved on to proving the fluctuation dissipation theorem in this context. Finally, we proceed to holographcally compute the Butterfly velocity by using the entanglement wedge subregion duality and express the diffusion coefficients in terms of the chaotic observables.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter dynamics: effects of Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key features of the $R^2$-gravity is the embedding of a scalar field, scalaron, into the gravity sector. The scalaron interacts with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the scalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the lack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and observational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM candidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs, despite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced trilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the $R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the early universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of the scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear interaction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs non-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron density through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we find that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between $1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC constraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises from INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron decays to two photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies, while offering a compelling alternative to inflationary models, face challenges from the growth of vector perturbations during the contracting phase. While linear vector instabilities can be avoided with specific initial conditions or the absence of vector degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the significant role of secondary vector perturbations generated by nonlinear interactions with scalar fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that in a broad class of single-field matter-bounce scenarios, these secondary vector perturbations get unacceptably large amplitudes, provided the curvature fluctuations are consistent with cosmic microwave background observations. This finding underscores the crucial importance of scalar-induced vector perturbations in bouncing cosmology and highlights the need for further investigation into their potential impact on the viability of these models.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic law of accelerating and rotating black hole described by ro- tating C-metric, as well as holography properties in Nariai limit, which are related to Nariai-CFT and Kerr-CFT correspondence. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from spinless limit to general case, and derive the frist law based on this construction through covariant phase space formalism. Serving for potential future studies, we also reduce the model to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the isentropic absorption of a classical charged test particle is classically forbidden for all 3+1 dimensional stationary, non-extremal, axisymmetric black holes in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This result is derived purely from the near-horizon geometry and thermodynamic properties of the black hole spacetime, independent of the specific gravitational theory. We further consider the Kerr-Newman black hole in general relativity and analyse, using the quantum tunnelling approach, the conditions under which isentropic absorption may become allowed. Broader implications for the second law and extremality bounds are discussed.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable, non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable approach to interacting dark energy.</description>

      <title>The Preheating Stage on The Starobinsky Inflation after ACT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation and its reheating features after the ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model satisfy ACT with $68\%$ CL, the number of e-folds increases to $&gt;70$ while the reheating temperature drops to $10^4$ GeV. The preheating stages and the reheating temperature need to be adjusted drastically in favor of the lower temperature. We obtain that the preheating stage of Starobinsky inflation should be mixed between tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating to favor the analytical estimation, PBH abundance, and the low reheating temperature at once. For that purpose, a varied momentum is necessary to obtain the favored results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two Dark Energy (DE) models characterized by higher-order derivatives of the Hubble parameter $H$, which generalize previously proposed DE scenarios. Assuming a power-law form of the scale factor $a(t)$ given by $a(t)=b_0t^n$, we derive analytical expressions for the DE energy density, pressure, the Equation of State (EoS) parameter, the deceleration parameter and the evolutionary form of the fractional DE density. Both non-interacting and interacting dark sector frameworks are examined, with the interaction modeled through a coupling term proportional to the Dark Matter (DM) energy density. For specific parameter sets corresponding to power-law indices $n=2$, $n=3$, and $n=4$, we compute the present age of the Universe. The obtained values deviate from the observationally inferred age of $\approx 13.8$ Gyr; however, a systematic trend is identified, with larger $n$ leading to higher ages. Furthermore, interacting scenarios consistently predict larger ages compared to their non-interacting counterparts. These results highlight the phenomenological viability and limitations of higher-derivative DE models in describing the cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order WKB method with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration. Our results show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications of black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain rotating black hole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the cosmological constant. There are eight parameters in the solutions. They are the physical mass $M$, the electric charge $Q$, the specific angular momentum $a$, the acceleration $\alpha$, the cosmological constant $\lambda$ and other three parameters, $S_1\;, S_2$ and $S_3$. We show that $S_3$ and $S_1$ are actually the well-known NUT charge and the rescaled parameter $C$, respectively, for the Kerr-NUT spacetime. As for $S_2$, it is a new parameter although it has the same physical meaning of $C$ in the weak field limit. In the case of static limit, $S_2$ describes a conical defect along the axis of revolution, which corresponds to a cosmic string of tension. Therefore, the solutions extend the accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Numerous observations have shown that almost all galaxies in our Universe host supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but there is still much debate about their formation and evolutionary processes. Recently, gravitational waves (GWs) have been expected to be a new and important informative observation, in particular, in the low-frequency region by making use of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). As an evolutionary process of the SMBHs, we revisit a dark matter (DM) halo-SMBH coevolution model based on the halo merger tree employing an ansatz for the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at $z=6$. In this model, the mass of SMBHs grows through their mergers associated with the halo mergers, and hence the evolutionary information must be stored in the GWs emitted at the mergers. We investigate the stochastic gravitational background from the coalescing SMBH binaries, which the PTAs can detect, and also the GW bursts emitted at the mergers, which can be detected by the mHz band observations such as LISA. We also discuss the possibility of probing the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at high redshift by future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Backreaction inclusive Schwinger effect in flat and de Sitter spacetimes via a self consistent Maxwell Schrodinger semiclassical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a self consistent framework to study the backreaction effects of particle creation in the coupled semiclassical dynamics of a quantum complex scalar field and a classical electric field in both (1 + 1) and (1 + 3) dimensional Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes. Using a general Gaussian state formalism in the Schrodinger picture, we solve the resulting nonlinear equations with Gaussian initial data, obtaining a self consistent semiclassical evolution that incorporates nonperturbative backreaction. We compute the time-dependent instantaneous particle content, current density, and electric field, defined through instantaneous eigenstates of the field modes. Comparing scenarios with and without backreaction, we find that backreaction strongly modifies the electric field and current, producing immediate plasma like oscillations and driving pronounced oscillations in the instantaneous mode occupations through nonadiabatic squeezing and quantum interference. These oscillations do not imply additional irreversible particle production the time averaged particle number remains essentially constant but they reveal the rich nonperturbative real-time dynamics captured by our self-consistent semiclassical approach across dimensions and in both Minkowski and de Sitter backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy expansion and the peak value of the bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12133</link>

Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parametrize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode-stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Chiral Limit of Fully Nonlinear Minimal Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity in two regimes: a) at the chiral limit where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes become null and b) in the regime that one of the two charges is much larger than the other. At the chiral point, we go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations. We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled in the neighborhood of the chiral limit, where the theory is anyway not unitary. We show that this is not the case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops, starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk Feynman diagrams. Finally, we show that there is no strong coupling problem in the second regime where, instead, the two boundary fields and the field propagating in the bulk decouple from one another.</description>

      <title>Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shadow of a black hole is critically dependent on the surrounding accreting matter. We investigate the observational signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo under three distinct accretion scenarios: a geometrically thin disk, a static spherical flow, and an infalling spherical flow. For the thin disk model, we find that direct emission dominates the total observed intensity, while the size and brightness of the lensing and photon rings serve as sensitive probes of the Hernquist DM parameters. Under spherical accretion, the Hernquist DM halo significantly enlarges the photon sphere. This results in an observable shadow that is approximately $2\%$ to $30\%$ larger than in the vacuum case, though this increase in size is accompanied by a considerable decrease in overall image brightness. Furthermore, the Doppler de-boosting effect in the infalling scenario produces a markedly darker image than its static counterpart. Our results demonstrate that the size and brightness profile of a black hole shadow provide a powerful observational tool to probe and constrain the distribution of dark matter in galactic centers.</description>
