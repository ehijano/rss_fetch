      <title>Approximating particle-based clustering dynamics by stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) as a practical tool to replicate clustering effects of more detailed particle-based dynamics. Inspired by membrane-mediated receptor dynamics on cell surfaces, we formulate a stochastic particle-based model for diffusion and pairwise interaction of particles, leading to intriguing clustering phenomena. Employing numerical simulation and cluster detection methods, we explore the approximation of the particle-based clustering dynamics through mean-field approaches. We find that SPDEs successfully reproduce spatiotemporal clustering dynamics, not only in the initial cluster formation period, but also on longer time scales where the successive merging of clusters cannot be tracked by deterministic mean-field models. The computational efficiency of the SPDE approach allows us to generate extensive statistical data for parameter estimation in a simpler model that uses a Markov jump process to capture the temporal evolution of the cluster number.</description>

      <title>Mitosis, Cytoskeleton Regulation, and Drug Resistance in Receptor Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for personalizing medical treatment are the focal point of contemporary biomedical research. In cancer care, we can analyze the effects of therapies at the level of individual cells. Quantitative characterization of treatment efficacy and evaluation of why some individuals respond to specific regimens, whereas others do not, requires additional approaches to genetic sequencing at single time points. Methods for the continuous analysis of changes in phenotype, such as in vivo and ex vivo morphology and motion tracking of cellular proteins and organelles, over time-frames spanning the minute-hour scales, can provide important insights into patient treatment options.
  Despite improvements in the diagnosis and therapy of many types of breast cancer (BC), many aggressive forms, such as receptor triple-negative cancers, are associated with the worst patient outcomes; though initially effective in reducing tumor burden for some patients, acquired resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy is almost universal, and there is no rationale for identifying intrinsically drug-resistant and drug-sensitive patient populations before initiating therapy. During cell division, the receptor triple-negative MDA-MB-231 mitotic spindles are the largest in comparison to other BC cell lines. Many of the MDA-MB-231 spindles exhibit rapid lateral twisting during metaphase, which remains unaffected by knockdown of the oncogene Myc and treatment with inhibitors of the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alone or in any combination.
  In this manuscript, we outline a strategy for the selection of the most optimal tubulin inhibitor based on the ability to affect MT dynamics.</description>

      <title>Predicting T-Cell Receptor Specificity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researching the specificity of TCR contributes to the development of immunotherapy and provides new opportunities and strategies for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, we established a TCR generative specificity detection framework consisting of an antigen selector and a TCR classifier based on the Random Forest algorithm, aiming to efficiently screen out TCRs and target antigens and achieve TCR specificity prediction. Furthermore, we used the k-fold validation method to compare the performance of our model with ordinary deep learning methods. The result proves that adding a classifier to the model based on the random forest algorithm is very effective, and our model generally outperforms ordinary deep learning methods. Moreover, we put forward feasible optimization suggestions for the shortcomings and challenges of our model found during model implementation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Drug Safety Assessment using Bidirectional-LSTM for SMILES Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational methods are useful in accelerating the pace of drug discovery. Drug discovery carries several steps such as target identification and validation, lead discovery, and lead optimisation etc., In the phase of lead optimisation, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties of lead compounds are assessed. To address the issue of predicting toxicity and solubility in the lead compounds, represented in Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation. Among the different approaches that work on SMILES data, the proposed model was built using a sequence-based approach. The proposed Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) is a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that processes input molecular sequences for the comprehensive examination of the structural features of molecules from both forward and backward directions. The proposed work aims to understand the sequential patterns encoded in the SMILES strings, which are then utilised for predicting the toxicity of the molecules. The proposed model on the ClinTox dataset surpasses previous approaches such as Trimnet and Pre-training Graph neural networks(GNN) by achieving a ROC accuracy of 0.96. BiLSTM outperforms the previous model on FreeSolv dataset with a low RMSE value of 1.22 in solubility prediction.</description>

      <title>On Machine Learning Approaches for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binding affinity optimization is crucial in early-stage drug discovery. While numerous machine learning methods exist for predicting ligand potency, their comparative efficacy remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance of classical tree-based models and advanced neural networks in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our comprehensive benchmarking encompasses 2D models utilizing ligand-only RDKit embeddings and Large Language Model (LLM) ligand representations, as well as 3D neural networks incorporating bound protein-ligand conformations. We assess these models across multiple standard datasets, examining various predictive scenarios including classification, ranking, regression, and active learning. Results indicate that simpler models can surpass more complex ones in specific tasks, while 3D models leveraging structural information become increasingly competitive with larger training datasets containing compounds with labelled affinity data against multiple targets. Pre-trained 3D models, by incorporating protein pocket environments, demonstrate significant advantages in data-scarce scenarios for specific binding pockets. Additionally, LLM pretraining on 2D ligand data enhances complex model performance, providing versatile embeddings that outperform traditional RDKit features in computational efficiency. Finally, we show that combining 2D and 3D model strengths improves active learning outcomes beyond current state-of-the-art approaches. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing machine learning strategies in drug discovery pipelines.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cancer Stem Cell Markers Distribution:A Hypergraph Analysis Across Organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyse the distribution of cancer stem cell markers (CSCMs) across various cancer-affected organs using hypergraphs. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a crucial role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. By employing hypergraphs, we model the relationships between CSCM locations and cancerous organs, providing a comprehensive representation of these interactions. Initially, we utilised an unweighted incidence matrix and its Markov transition matrices to gain a dynamic perspective on CSCM distributions. This method allows us to observe how these markers spread and influence cancer progression in a dynamical context. By calculating mutual information for each node and hyperedge, our analysis uncovers complex interaction patterns between CSCMs and organs, highlighting the critical roles of certain markers in cancer progression and metastasis. Our approach offers a detailed representation of cancer stem cell networks, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms driving cancer heterogeneity and metastasis. By integrating hypergraph theory with cancer biology, this study provides valuable insights for developing targeted cancer therapies.</description>

      <title>Unmasking unlearnable models: a classification challenge for biomedical images without visible cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting traits from images lacking visual cues is challenging, as algorithms are designed to capture visually correlated ground truth. This problem is critical in biomedical sciences, and their solution can improve the efficacy of non-invasive methods. For example, a recent challenge of predicting MGMT methylation status from MRI images is critical for treatment decisions of glioma patients. Using less robust models poses a significant risk in these critical scenarios and underscores the urgency of addressing this issue. Despite numerous efforts, contemporary models exhibit suboptimal performance, and underlying reasons for this limitation remain elusive. In this study, we demystify the complexity of MGMT status prediction through a comprehensive exploration by performing benchmarks of existing models adjoining transfer learning. Their architectures were further dissected by observing gradient flow across layers. Additionally, a feature selection strategy was applied to improve model interpretability. Our finding highlighted that current models are unlearnable and may require new architectures to explore applications in the real world. We believe our study will draw immediate attention and catalyse advancements in predictive modelling with non-visible cues.</description>

      <title>Research on Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction Model Combining Knowledge Graph Embedding and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In clinical treatment, identifying potential adverse reactions of drugs can help assist doctors in making medication decisions. In response to the problems in previous studies that features are high-dimensional and sparse, independent prediction models need to be constructed for each adverse reaction of drugs, and the prediction accuracy is low, this paper develops an adverse drug reaction prediction model based on knowledge graph embedding and deep learning, which can predict experimental results. Unified prediction of adverse drug reactions covered. Knowledge graph embedding technology can fuse the associated information between drugs and alleviate the shortcomings of high-dimensional sparsity in feature matrices, and the efficient training capabilities of deep learning can improve the prediction accuracy of the model. This article builds an adverse drug reaction knowledge graph based on drug feature data; by analyzing the embedding effect of the knowledge graph under different embedding strategies, the best embedding strategy is selected to obtain sample vectors; and then a convolutional neural network model is constructed to predict adverse reactions. The results show that under the DistMult embedding model and 400-dimensional embedding strategy, the convolutional neural network model has the best prediction effect; the average accuracy, F_1 score, recall rate and area under the curve of repeated experiments are better than the methods reported in the literature. The obtained prediction model has good prediction accuracy and stability, and can provide an effective reference for later safe medication guidance.</description>

      <title>DiMA: Sequence Diversity Dynamics Analyser for Viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence diversity is one of the major challenges in the design of diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against viruses. DiMA is a novel tool that is big data-ready and designed to facilitate the dissection of sequence diversity dynamics for viruses. DiMA stands out from other diversity analysis tools by offering various unique features. DiMA provides a quantitative overview of sequence (nucleotide/protein) diversity by use of Shannon's entropy corrected for size bias, applied via a user-defined k-mer sliding window to an input alignment file, and each k-mer position is dissected to various diversity motifs. The motifs are defined based on the probability of distinct sequences at a given k-mer position, whereby an index is the predominant sequence, while all the others are (total) variants to the index. The total variants are sub-classified into the major (most common) variant, minor variants (occurring more than once and of frequency lower than the major), and the unique (singleton) variants. DiMA allows user-defined, sequence metadata enrichment for analyses of the motifs. The application of DiMA was demonstrated for the alignment data of the relatively conserved Spike protein (2,106,985 sequences) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the relatively highly diverse Pol protein (3,874) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). The tool is publicly available as a web server (https://dima.bezmialem.edu.tr), as a Python library (via PyPi) and as a command line client (Via GitHub).</description>

      <title>Injecting Hierarchical Biological Priors into Graph Neural Networks for Flow Cytometry Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the complex landscape of hematologic samples such as peripheral blood or bone marrow derived from flow cytometry (FC) data, cell-level prediction presents profound challenges. This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors. The proposed approach highlights the importance of structured inductive biases for gaining improved generalization in complex biological prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Computing the Frequency Response of Biochemical Networks: A Python module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a set of Python methods is described that can be used to compute the frequency response of an arbitrary biochemical network given any input and output. Models can be provided in standard SBML or Antimony format. The code takes into account any conserved moieties so that this software can be used to also study signaling networks where moiety cycles are common. A utility method is also provided to make it easy to plot standard Bode plots from the generated results. The code also takes into account the possibility that the phase shift could exceed 180 degrees which can result in ugly discontinuities in the Bode plot. In the paper, some of the theory behind the method is provided as well as some commentary on the code and several illustrative examples to show the code in operation. Illustrative examples include linear reaction chains of varying lengths and the effect of negative feedback on the frequency response.
