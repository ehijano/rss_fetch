      <title>Controlled Switching of Bose-Einstein Condensation in a Mixture of Two Species of Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report temperature-dependent switching between lower and upper polariton condensation in a GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity when both of these species have comparable populations in a mixture. Using angle-resolved photoluminescence, we observe that at low temperatures, condensation occurs in the lower polariton branch, while at elevated temperatures, the upper polariton branch can become favored. At an intermediate temperature, we observe instability in the condensate formation, characterized by metastable correlations of the fluctuations in intensity and linewidth of the lower and upper polariton branches.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional asymmetrically interacting quantum droplets in Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate ground-state properties and collective excitations of one-dimensional quantum droplets in asymmetric Bose-Bose mixtures with unequal intraspin interactions. Using the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation supported by variational and sum-rule methods, we show that the intraspin interaction ratio substantially alters the droplet's density profile, driving a transition from Gaussian-like to flat-top shapes. By examining two experimentally relevant parameter regions, we analyze density profiles, radii, peak densities, and excitation spectra to distinguish quantum phases and to depict phase diagrams in the space of asymmetric interaction ratio and total atom number. We carefully study the frequencies of both well-known dipole and breathing modes and less-explored spin dipole and spin breathing modes. The breathing mode frequency decreases monotonically with interaction ratio, approaching asymptotically the result of a conventional weakly interacting Bose gas. It varies non-monotonically with total atom number, peaking at a critical point that highlights the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. In contrast, spin modes display distinct temporal spin density distributions and reveal in-phase and out-of-phase relative dynamics between components. Their frequencies depend instead monotonically on the interaction ratio and atom number. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of asymmetric quantum droplets and link to experimentally accessible regimes in ultracold $^{39}$K atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cellular Automata on a Dual-Species Rydberg Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum devices scale to larger and larger sizes, a significant challenge emerges in scaling their coherent controls accordingly. Quantum cellular automata (QCAs) constitute a promising framework that bypasses this control problem: universal dynamics can be achieved using only a static qubit array and global control operations. We realize QCAs on a dual-species Rydberg array of rubidium and cesium atoms, leveraging independent global control of each species to perform a myriad of quantum protocols. With simple pulse sequences, we explore many-body dynamics and generate a variety of entangled states, including GHZ states, 96.7(1.7)%-fidelity Bell states, 17-qubit cluster states, and high-connectivity graph states. The versatility and scalability of QCAs offers compelling routes for scaling quantum information systems with global controls, as well as new perspectives on quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of conformal field theory spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) feature prominently in high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter. For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave all-optical single-photon transistor based on a Rydberg-atom ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-wave (cw) architectures provide a promising route to interface disparate quantum systems by relaxing the need for precise synchronization. While essential cw components, including microwave single-photon transistors and microwave-optical converters, have been explored, an all-optical cw single-photon transistor has remained a missing piece. We propose a high-efficiency, high-gain implementation using Rydberg atoms, in which a control photon disrupts the transmission of a continuous probe beam via the van der Waals interaction. This device completes the set of components required for cw processing of quantum signals and paves the way for all-optical processing at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave quantum light control via engineered Rydberg-induced dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze several implementations of all-optical single-photon transistors (SPTs) operating in the continuous-wave (cw) regime, as presented in the companion paper [Phys. Rev. A 113, L011701 (2026)]. The devices rely on ensembles of Rydberg atoms interacting via van der Waals interactions. Under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), a weak probe field is fully transmitted through the atomic ensemble in the absence of control photons. Exciting a collective Rydberg state with a single control photon breaks the EIT condition, thereby strongly suppressing the probe transmission. We show how collective Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble, confined either in an optical cavity or in free space, give rise to two distinct probe-induced dephasing mechanisms. These processes localize the control excitations, extend their lifetimes, and increase the device efficiency. We characterize the SPTs in terms of control-photon absorption probability and probe gain, supported by numerical simulations of realistic one- and three-dimensional ensembles. The proposed cw devices complement previously demonstrated SPTs and broaden the toolbox of quantum light manipulation circuitry.</description>

      <title>Narrowline cooling of dysprosium atoms in an optical tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.</description>
