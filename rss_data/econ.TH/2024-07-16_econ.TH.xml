      <title>Incentivizing Agents through Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the optimal design of performance or product ratings to motivate agents' performance or investment in product quality. The principal designs a rating that maps their quality (performance) to possibly stochastic scores. Agents have private information about their abilities (cost of effort/quality) and choose their quality. The market observes the scores and offers a wage equal to the agent's expected quality [resp. ability].
  I first show that an incentive-compatible interim wage function can be induced by a rating (i.e., feasible) if and only if it is a mean-preserving spread of quality [resp. ability]. Thus, I reduce the principal's rating design problem to the design of a feasible interim wage. When restricted to deterministic ratings, the optimal rating design is equivalent to the optimal delegation with participation constraints (Amador and Bagwell, 2022). Using optimal control theory, I provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which lower censorship, and particularly a simple pass/fail test, are optimal within deterministic ratings. In particular, when the principal elicits maximal effort (quality), lower censorship [resp. pass/fail] is optimal if the density is unimodal [resp. increasing]. I also solve for the optimal deterministic ratings beyond lower censorship for general distributions and preferences. For general ratings, I provide sufficient conditions under which lower censorship remains optimal. In the effort-maximizing case, a pass/fail test remains optimal if the density is increasing.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Feasible Payoff Set of OLG Repeated Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the set of (stationary) feasible payoffs of OLG repeated games that can be achieved by action sequences in which every generation of players plays the same sequence of action profiles. Our first main result completely characterizes the set of feasible payoffs given any fixed discount factor of players and the length of interaction. We can use this result to obtain the feasible payoff set in closed form. Second, we provide novel comparative statics of the feasible payoff set with respect to the discount factor and the length of interaction. Perhaps interestingly, the feasible payoff set becomes smaller as players' discount factor becomes larger. In addition, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition for this monotonicity to be strict.</description>
