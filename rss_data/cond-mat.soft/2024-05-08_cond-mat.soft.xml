      <title>Defect ground states for liquid crystals on cones and hyperbolic cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution is intended for Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical Special issue on Non-equilibrium Dynamics in Complex Systems: Celebrating the Contributions of Uwe T\"{a}uber on his 60th Birthday. Cones with orientational order in the local tangent plane provide a soft matter analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We first review recent work on 2D liquid crystals with $p$-fold rotational symmetry on cones. We exploit an analogy with electrostatics to determine the ground state as a function of both the cone angle and the liquid crystal symmetry for both free and tangential boundary conditions applied at the cone base. There is an effective topological charge $-\chi$ at the apex, where $2\pi\chi$ is the deficit angle. The ground states are in general frustrated due to parallel transport along the azimuthal direction on the cone. In the case of tangential boundary conditions, the ground state changes as a function of $\chi$, where the apex absorbs and emits quantized defect charges, with intricate dependence on both the deficit angle and $p$. We check our predictions numerically for a set of commensurate cone angles, whose surfaces can be polygonized as a perfect triangular or square mesh, and find excellent agreement. Cones with both free and tangential boundary conditions can also exhibit metastable states distinguished by quantized screening of the apex charge. We also present preliminary work on hyperbolic cones, where the Gaussian curvature singularity is negative at the apex. When free boundary conditions are applied at the base, the ground states are characterized by an effective topological charge at the apex, similarly to the case of conventional cones. However, when tangential boundary conditions are applied, decreasing the deficit angle (which is now negative) induces neutral defect pair nucleation at the apex followed by emission of a positive defect.</description>

      <title>A snapshot review on soft-materials assembly design utilizing machine learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the surge of data in materials science research and the advancement in machine learning methods, an increasing number of researchers are introducing machine learning techniques into the next generation of materials discovery, ranging from neural-network learned potentials to automated characterization techniques for experimental images. In this snapshot review, we first summarize the landscape of techniques for soft materials assembly design that do not employ machine learning or artificial intelligence and then discuss specific machine-learning and artificial-intelligence-based methods that enhance the design pipeline, such as high-throughput crystal-structure characterization and the inverse design of building blocks for materials assembly and properties. Additionally, we survey the landscape of current developments of scientific software, especially in the context of their compatibility with traditional molecular dynamics engines such as LAMMPS and HOOMD-blue.</description>

      <title>Analytical Interaction Potential for Lennard-Jones Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical form has been derived using Ostrogradski's integration method for the interaction between two thin rods of finite lengths in arbitrary relative configurations in a 3-dimensional space, each treated as a line of material points interacting through the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. Simplified analytical forms for coplanar, parallel, and collinear rods are also derived. Exact expressions for the force and torque between the rods are obtained. Similar results for a point particle interacting with a thin rod are provided. These interaction potentials can be widely used for analytical descriptions and computational modeling of systems involving rod-like objects such as liquid crystals, colloids, polymers, elongated viruses and bacteria, and filamentous materials including carbon nanotubes, nanowires, biological filaments, and their bundles.</description>

      <title>Generalized Langevin dynamics for single beads in linear elastic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) for single beads in linear elastic networks. In particular, the derivations of the GLEs are conducted without employing normal modes, resulting in two distinct representations in terms of resistance and mobility kernels. The fluctuation-dissipation relations are also confirmed for both GLEs. Subsequently, we demonstrate that these two representations are interconnected via Laplace transforms. Furthermore, another GLE is derived by utilizing a projection operator method, and it is shown that the equation obtained through the projection scheme is consistent with the GLE with the resistance kernel. Finally, as the simplest example, the present framework is applied to the Rouse model, and the GLEs with the resistance and mobility kernels are explicitly derived for arbitrary positions of the tagged bead in the Rouse chain.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity Classes of Quasiperiodic Tilings via Diffusion Spreadability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform point patterns can be classified by the hyperuniformity scaling exponent $\alpha &gt; 0$, that characterizes the power-law scaling behavior of the structure factor $S(\mathbf{k})$ as a function of wavenumber $k\equiv|\mathbf{k}|$ in the vicinity of the origin, e.g., $S(\mathbf{k})\sim|\mathbf{k}|^{\alpha}$ in cases where $S(\mathbf{k})$ varies continuously with $k$ as $k\rightarrow0$. In this paper, we show that the spreadability is an effective method for determining $\alpha$ for quasiperiodic systems where $S(\mathbf{k})$ is discontinuous and consists of a dense set of Bragg peaks. We first transform quasiperiodic and limit-periodic point patterns into two-phase media by mapping them onto packings of identical nonoverlapping disks, where space interior to the disks represents one phase and the space in exterior to them represents the second phase. We then compute the spectral density of the packings, and finally compute and fit the long-time behavior of their excess spreadabilities. Specifically, we show that the excess spreadability can be used to accurately extract $\alpha$ for the 1D limit-periodic period doubling chain and the 1D quasicrystalline Fibonacci chain to within $0.02\%$ of the analytically known exact results. Moreover, we obtain a value of $\alpha = 5.97\pm0.06$ for the 2D Penrose tiling, which had not been computed previously. We also show that one can truncate the small-$k$ region of the scattering information used to compute the spreadability and still obtain an accurate value of $\alpha$. The methods described here offer a simple way to characterize the large-scale translational order present in quasicrystalline and limit-periodic media in any space dimension that are self-similar. Moreover, the scattering information extracted from these two-phase media encoded in the spectral density can be used to estimate their physical properties. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Limits to positional information in boundary-driven systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical gradients can be used by a particle to determine its position. This \textit{positional information} is of crucial importance, for example in developmental biology in the formation of patterns in an embryo. The central goal of this paper is to study the fundamental physical limits on how much positional information can be stored inside a system. To achieve this, we study positional information for general boundary-driven systems, and derive, in the near-equilibrium regime, a universal expression involving only the chemical potential and density gradients of the system. We also conjecture that this expression serves as an upper bound on the positional information of boundary driven systems beyond linear response. To support this claim, we test it on a broad range of solvable boundary-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Role of cilia activity and surrounding viscous fluid on properties of metachronal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large groups of active cilia collectively beat in a fluid medium as metachronal waves, essential for some microorganisms motility and for flow generation in mucociliary clearance. Several models can predict the emergence of metachronal waves, but what controls the properties of metachronal waves is still unclear. Here, we investigate numerically a simple model for cilia in the presence of noise on regular lattices in one- and two-dimensions. We characterize the wave using spatial correlation and the frequency of collective beating. Our results clearly show that the viscosity of the fluid medium does not affect the wavelength; the activity of the cilia does. These numerical results are supported by a dimensional analysis, which is expected to be robust against the model for active force generation, unless surrounding fluid influences the cilia activity. Interestingly, enhancement of cilia activity increases the wavelength and decreases the beating frequency, keeping the wave velocity almost unchanged. These results might have significance in understanding paramecium locomotion and mucociliary clearance diseases.</description>

      <title>Rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres across the jamming and viscous-to-inertial transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres is studied across jamming but also across the viscous and inertial regimes using a custom pressure- and volume-imposed rheometer. The study shows that the granular rheology found for suspensions of hard spheres can be extended to a soft granular rheology (SGR) by renormalizing the critical volume fraction and friction coefficient to pressure-dependent values and using the addition of the viscous and inertial stress scales. This SGR encompasses rheological behaviors on both sides of the jamming transition, resulting in an approximate collapse of the rheological data into two branches when scaled with the distance to jamming, as observed for soft colloids. This research suggests that suspensions of soft particles across flow regimes can be described by a uni?ed SGR framework around the jamming transition.</description>

      <title>Rheology of granular particles immersed in a molecular gas under uniform shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Newtonian transport properties of a dilute gas of inelastic hard spheres immersed in a molecular gas are determined. We assume that the granular gas is sufficiently rarefied and hence, the state of the molecular gas is not disturbed by the presence of the solid particles. In this situation, one can treat the molecular gas as a bath (or thermostat) of elastic hard spheres at a given temperature. Moreover, in spite of the fact that the number density of grains is quite small, we take into account their inelastic collisions among themselves in its kinetic equation. The system (granular gas plus a bath of elastic hard spheres) is subjected to a simple (or uniform) shear flow (USF). In the low-density regime, the rheological properties of the granular gas are determined by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation by means of Grad's moment method. These properties turn out to be highly nonlinear functions of the shear rate and the remaining parameters of the system. Our results show that the kinetic granular temperature and the non-Newtonian viscosity present a discontinuous shear thickening (DST) effect for sufficiently high values of the mass ratio $m/m_g$ ($m$ and $m_g$ being the mass of grains and gas particles, respectively). This effect becomes more pronounced as the mass ratio $m/m_g$ increases. In particular, in the Brownian limit ($m/m_g\to \infty$) the expressions of the non-Newtonian transport properties derived here are consistent with those previously obtained by considering a coarse-grained approach where the effect of gas phase on grains is through an effective force. Theoretical results are compared against computer simulations showing an excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability behind brittle fracture in soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that nucleation of brittle cracks in initially flawless soft elastic solids is preceded by a nonlinear elastic instability, which cannot be captured without accounting for geometrical precise description of finite elastic deformation. As a prototypical problem we consider a homogeneous elastic body subjected to tension and assume that it is weakened by the presence of a free surface which then serves as a site of crack nucleation. We show that in this maximally simplified setting, brittle fracture emerges from a symmetry breaking elastic instability activated by softening and involving large elastic rotations. The implied bifurcation of the homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly unconventional for nonlinear elasticity as it exhibits an extraordinary sensitivity to geometry, reminiscent of the transition to turbulence in fluids. We trace the post-bifurcational development of this instability beyond the limits of applicability of scale free continuum elasticity and use a phase-field approach to capture the scale dependent sub-continuum strain localization, signaling the formation of actual cracks.</description>

      <title>Emergence of multiphase condensates from a limited set of chemical building blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecules composed of a limited set of chemical building blocks can co-localize into distinct, spatially segregated compartments known as biomolecular condensates. While many condensates are known to form spontaneously via phase separation, it has been unclear how immiscible condensates with precisely controlled molecular compositions assemble from a small number of chemical building blocks. We address this question by establishing a connection between the specificity of biomolecular interactions and the thermodynamic stability of coexisting condensates. By computing the minimum interaction specificity required to assemble condensates with target molecular compositions, we show how to design heteropolymer mixtures that produce compositionally complex condensates using only a small number of monomer types. Our results provide insight into how compositional specificity arises in naturally occurring multicomponent condensates and demonstrate a rational algorithm for engineering complex artificial condensates from simple chemical building blocks.</description>

      <title>Light-responsive active particles in a thermotropic liquid crystal</title>

Abstract: The development of synthetic microswimmers has advanced our understanding of the fundamental self-propelled mechanisms of living systems. However, there are scarce studies at the microscale within highly structured anisotropic media, such as bacteria or cellular receptors that swim in concentrated solutions of filamentous proteins or lipids with viscoelastic properties. Synthetic liquid crystals (LCs) have the potential to serve as biomimetic surrogates to study the structure and dynamics of living systems. Nevertheless, studies on thermotropic LCs have mainly focused on electro and magneto-phoretic effects, with a few others on diffusiophoresis or light-driven distortions of the LC nematic director. To the best of our knowledge, here we report self-thermophoretic experiments on thermotropic LCs for the first time. Our system consists of 2D confined Janus particles in 5CB with homeotropic anchoring on the particle and LC cell surfaces. The Janus particles include a conductive titanium coating that, upon exposure to an LED source, is heated and induces a local steady nematic-isotropic phase transition, leading to the self-propulsion of the particles orthogonally to the LC director. The trajectories of the Janus particles were tracked at different intensities of the applied light. A model is developed to describe the mean-squared displacement of a Janus particle suspended in a nematic LC. The model assumes that the Janus particle feels the LC as a continuum with the anisotropic viscosity of the bulk nematic phase. Moreover, the viscoelasticity of the LC is also considered. The model describes the experimental data well, and the fitting parameter related to the magnitude of the swimming force increases with the intensity of the applied light. Moreover, our approach represents an important step for developing a platform for highly structured anisotropic active materials.</description>

      <title>Pinning Disfavors Nucleation in Colloidal Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vapor deposition, known for precise structural control, is inevitably influenced by impurities. These impurities, often distinct from the depositing material, can significantly impact material properties, including local structure. Interestingly, the effect of immobilizing some of the depositing particles themselves, which would still preserve local structural symmetry, remains largely unexplored. By introducing a small fraction of pinned sites during colloidal vapor deposition and employing a combination of thermodynamic and kinematic measurements, we demonstrate that pinned sites, termed as "mobility impurities," are disfavored as nucleation centers. Moreover, tuning the mobility of mobile colloids can adjust nucleation likelihood. In later stages of growth, pinning induces mode localization, altering the thin film's vibrational spectrum. Our research thus underscores the potential of strategically incorporating mobility impurities to engineer material properties.</description>
