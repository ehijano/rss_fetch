      <title>MSTest: An R-Package for Testing Markov Switching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the R package MSTest, which implements hypothesis testing procedures to identify the number of regimes in Markov switching models. These models have wide-ranging applications in economics, finance, and numerous other fields. The MSTest package includes the Monte Carlo likelihood ratio test procedures proposed by Rodriguez-Rondon and Dufour (2024), the moment-based tests of Dufour and Luger (2017), the parameter stability tests of Carrasco, Hu, and Ploberger (2014), and the likelihood ratio test of Hansen (1992). Additionally, the package enables users to simulate and estimate univariate and multivariate Markov switching and hidden Markov processes, using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We demonstrate the functionality of the MSTest package through both simulation experiments and an application to U.S. GNP growth data.</description>

      <title>Improving the convergence of Markov chains via permutations and projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at improving the convergence to equilibrium of finite ergodic Markov chains via permutations and projections. First, we prove that a specific mixture of permuted Markov chains arises naturally as a projection under the KL divergence or the squared-Frobenius norm. We then compare various mixing properties of the mixture with other competing Markov chain samplers and demonstrate that it enjoys improved convergence. This geometric perspective motivates us to propose samplers based on alternating projections to combine different permutations and to analyze their rate of convergence. We give necessary, and under some additional assumptions also sufficient, conditions for the projection to achieve stationarity in the limit in terms of the trace of the transition matrix. We proceed to discuss tuning strategies of the projection samplers when these permutations are viewed as parameters. Along the way, we reveal connections between the mixture and a Markov chain Sylvester's equation as well as assignment problems, and highlight how these can be used to understand and improve Markov chain mixing. We provide two examples as illustrations. In the first example, the projection sampler (with a suitable choice of the permutation) improves upon Metropolis-Hastings in a discrete bimodal distribution with a reduced relaxation time from exponential to polynomial in the system size, while in the second example, the mixture of permuted Markov chain yields a mixing time that is logarithmic in system size (with high probability under random permutation), compared to a linear mixing time in the Diaconis-Holmes-Neal sampler.</description>

      <title>CMiNet: R package for learning the Consensus Microbiome Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding complex interactions within microbiomes is essential for exploring their roles in health and disease. However, constructing reliable microbiome networks often poses a challenge due to variations in the output of different network inference algorithms. To address this issue, we present CMiNet, an R package designed to generate a consensus microbiome network by integrating results from multiple established network construction methods. CMiNet incorporates nine widely used algorithms, including Pearson, Spearman, Biweight Midcorrelation (Bicor), SparCC, SpiecEasi, SPRING, GCoDA, and CCLasso, along with a novel algorithm based on conditional mutual information (CMIMN). By combining the strengths of these algorithms, CMiNet generates a single, weighted consensus network that provides a more stable and comprehensive representation of microbial interactions. The package includes customizable functions for network construction, visualization, and analysis, allowing users to explore network structures at different threshold levels and assess connectivity and reliability. CMiNet is designed to handle both quantitative and compositional data, ensuring broad applicability for researchers aiming to understand the intricate relationships within microbiome communities.

      <title>Expected Information Gain Estimation via Density Approximations: Sample Allocation and Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior (equivalently, mutual information between candidate observations and model parameters or other quantities of interest) is a fundamental challenge in Bayesian optimal experimental design. We formulate flexible transport-based schemes for EIG estimation in general nonlinear/non-Gaussian settings, compatible with both standard and implicit Bayesian models. These schemes are representative of two-stage methods for estimating or bounding EIG using marginal and conditional density estimates. In this setting, we analyze the optimal allocation of samples between training (density estimation) and approximation of the outer prior expectation. We show that with this optimal sample allocation, the MSE of the resulting EIG estimator converges more quickly than that of a standard nested Monte Carlo scheme. We then address the estimation of EIG in high dimensions, by deriving gradient-based upper bounds on the mutual information lost by projecting the parameters and/or observations to lower-dimensional subspaces. Minimizing these upper bounds yields projectors and hence low-dimensional EIG approximations that outperform approximations obtained via other linear dimension reduction schemes. Numerical experiments on a PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problem also illustrate a favorable trade-off between dimension truncation and the modeling of non-Gaussianity, when estimating EIG from finite samples in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic local variable importance for locally dependent relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global variable importance measures are commonly used to interpret machine learning model results. Local variable importance techniques assess how variables contribute to individual observations rather than the entire dataset. Current methods typically fail to accurately reflect locally dependent relationships between variables and instead focus on marginal importance values. Additionally, they are not natively adapted for multi-class classification problems. We propose a new model-agnostic method for calculating local variable importance, CLIQUE, that captures locally dependent relationships, contains improvements over permutation-based methods, and can be directly applied to multi-class classification problems. Simulated and real-world examples show that CLIQUE emphasizes locally dependent information and properly reduces bias in regions where variables do not affect the response.</description>

      <title>On Training Survival Models with Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scoring rules are an established way of comparing predictive performances across model classes. In the context of survival analysis, they require adaptation in order to accommodate censoring. This work investigates using scoring rules for model training rather than evaluation. Doing so, we establish a general framework for training survival models that is model agnostic and can learn event time distributions parametrically or non-parametrically. In addition, our framework is not restricted to any specific scoring rule. While we focus on neural network-based implementations, we also provide proof-of-concept implementations using gradient boosting, generalized additive models, and trees. Empirical comparisons on synthetic and real-world data indicate that scoring rules can be successfully incorporated into model training and yield competitive predictive performance with established time-to-event models.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Path Integral Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a novel approach for sampling from a continuous multivariate probability distribution, which may either be explicitly known (up to a normalization factor) or represented via empirical samples. Our method constructs a time-dependent bridge from a delta function centered at the origin of the state space at $t=0$, optimally transforming it into the target distribution at $t=1$. We formulate this as a Stochastic Optimal Control problem of the Path Integral Control type, with a cost function comprising (in its basic form) a quadratic control term, a quadratic state term, and a terminal constraint. This framework, which we refer to as Harmonic Path Integral Diffusion (H-PID), leverages an analytical solution through a mapping to an auxiliary quantum harmonic oscillator in imaginary time.
  The H-PID framework results in a set of efficient sampling algorithms, without the incorporation of Neural Networks. The algorithms are validated on two standard use cases: a mixture of Gaussians over a grid and images from CIFAR-10. The transparency of the method allows us to analyze the algorithms in detail, particularly revealing that the current weighted state is an order parameter for the dynamic phase transition, signaling earlier, at $t&lt;1$, that the sample generation process is almost complete. We contrast these algorithms with other sampling methods, particularly simulated annealing and path integral sampling, highlighting their advantages in terms of analytical control, accuracy, and computational efficiency on benchmark problems.
  Additionally, we extend the methodology to more general cases where the underlying stochastic differential equation includes an external deterministic, possibly non-conservative force, and where the cost function incorporates a gauge potential term.</description>
