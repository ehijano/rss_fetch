      <title>Quantized Chern-Simons Axion Coupling in Anomalous Floquet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized bulk response functions are hallmark signatures of topological phases, but their manifestation in periodically driven (Floquet) systems is not yet fully established. Here, we show that two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems exhibit a quantized bulk response encoded in a Chern-Simons axion (CSA) coupling angle, reflecting a topological magnetoelectric effect analogous to that in three-dimensional insulators. The periodic drive introduces an emergent "photon" dimension, allowing the system to be viewed as a three-dimensional Sambe lattice. Within this framework, cross-correlated responses such as photon-space polarization and magnetization density, emerge as physical signatures of the CSA coupling. The CSA angle, constructed from the non-Abelian Berry connection of Floquet states, admits a natural interpretation in terms of the geometry of hybrid Wannier states. These results provide a unified framework linking Floquet band topology to quantized bulk observables.</description>

      <title>The Interacting Energy Bands of Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene Revealed by the Quantum Twisting Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron interactions in quantum materials fundamentally shape their energy bands and, with them, the material's most intriguing quantum phases. Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where flat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of these bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum space probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly image the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and energy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow the single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that are completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy electronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the interplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of striking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization, Mott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light particles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy sector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve the long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by showing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same topological heavy fermion-like flat bands. More broadly, our results establish the QTM as a powerful tool for high-resolution spectroscopic studies of quantum materials previously inaccessible to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Electronic and Thermoelectric Properties of Molecular Junctions Incorporating Organometallic Complexes: Implications for Thermoelectric Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic and thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions formed from iron and ruthenium metal-acetylide were studied using complementary experimental techniques and quantum chemical simulations. We performed physical characterizations of single-molecule and self-assembled monolayer junctions of the same molecules that allowed meaningful comparisons between the Ru and Fe adducts. In the case of the Fe-containing junctions, two distinct oxidation states are present. These junctions exhibit one of the highest Seebeck coefficients (S ca. 130 {\mu}V/K) reported to date for similar systems paired with broad electric conductance distribution and limited thermal conductance. As a result, the experimental thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for Fe-containing junctions reaches up to 0.4 for junctions with relatively high conductance. This is one of the highest ZT values reported for molecular systems at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Fingerprinting of Bloch- and N\'{e}el-type Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>AC-driven Spin Valves: Capacitive Behavior and Resonator Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent spin transport phenomena in magnetic heterostructures under alternating currents (AC), advancing the relatively underdeveloped field of alternating spintronics. Employing a time-dependent spin diffusion model, we show that the interplay of AC frequencies and spin relaxation times reveals significant differences in spin accumulation patterns compared to conventional direct current (DC) scenarios. Of particular interest is the emergence of capacitive-like impedance in a spin valve under AC conditions, which is especially pronounced in antiparallel spin configurations. These findings open up possibilities for developing high-frequency spintronic devices, including the proposed "spin resonator", which functions like a standard LC resonator but without a traditional capacitor.</description>

      <title>Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</description>

      <title>Observation of Cavity-Mediated Nonlinear Landau Fan and Modified Landau Level Degeneracy in Graphene Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on cavity-coupled two-dimensional electron gas demonstrate that vacuum-field engineering can tailor electronic transport properties of materials. By achieving ultra-strong coupling between a terahertz resonator and mesoscopic graphene, we demonstrate that cavity vacuum fields can alter the effective degeneracies of Landau levels, resulting in a nonlinear Landau fan diagram for massless Dirac fermions while preserving quantum-Hall quantization. Specifically, by leveraging graphene's gate-tunability, we observe that quantum-Hall features, minimum longitudinal and quantized Hall conductance for a given filling factor, occur at carrier densities reduced by more than 20 percent compared to systems without cavity. Theoretical analysis attributes this effect to the virtual cavity photon mediated transitions between the non-equidistant Landau levels in graphene, significantly reducing their effective degeneracy. This study paves the way for investigating cavity quantum electrodynamics in highly tunable, atomically thin two-dimensional crystals.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Time Formalism for Causal Nonlinear Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that causal linear response functions can be found by computing the much simpler imaginary time-ordered Matsubara functions and performing an analytic continuation. This principle is the basis for much of our understanding of linear response for interacting and disordered systems, via diagrammatic perturbation theory. Similar imaginary-time approaches have recently been introduced for computing nonlinear response functions as well, although the rigorous connection between Matsubara and causal nonlinear response functions has not been clearly elucidated. In this work, we provide a proof of this connection to all orders in perturbation theory. Using an equations of motion approach, we show by induction that casual nonlinear response functions at every order can be obtained from an analytic continuation of an appropriate time-ordered Matsubara function. We demonstrate this connection explicitly for second order response functions in the Lehmann representation. As a byproduct of our approach, we derive an explicit expression for the Lehmann representation of $n$-th order response functions by solving the equations of motion. We also use our result to find an analytic spectral density representation for both causal response functions and Matsubara functions. Finally, we show how our results lead to a family of generalized sum rules, focusing explicitly on the asymptotic expression for $n$-th harmonic generation rate.</description>

      <title>Photocurrents induced by k-linear terms in semiconductors and semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a six-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ model to describe the electronic structure and optical response of chiral multifold semimetals, such as RhSi. By means of invariants method we construct the effective Hamiltonian describing the states near the $\Gamma$-point of the Brillouin zone where the spin-orbit coupling and $\mathbf{k}$-linear Rashba terms, which are crucial for circular photogalvanic effect, are taken into account. The model is parameterized using tight-binding calculations. We compute the interband absorption spectrum, showing a linear-in-frequency dependence at low energies and a resonant feature near the spin-orbit splitting energy. Furthermore, we calculate the circular photogalvanic effect. In agreement with previous works the current generation rate at low frequencies exhibits a quantized low-frequency response, governed by the universal value $|\mathcal{C}| = 4$ for the effective topological charge. Our results provide an analytical framework for understanding the role of Rashba coupling and topology in the optoelectronic properties of multifold chiral semimetals.</description>

      <title>Revealing electron-lattice decoupling by Peltier thermometry and nanoscale thermal imaging in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical currents in low-dimensional quantum materials can drive electrons far from equilibrium, creating stark imbalance between electron and lattice temperatures. Yet, no existing methods enable simultaneous nanoscale mapping of both temperatures at cryogenic conditions. Here, we introduce a scanning probe technique that images the local lattice temperature and extracts electron temperature at gate-defined p-n junctions in graphene. By applying an alternating electrical current and analyzing first- and second-harmonic responses, we disentangle Joule heating from the Peltier effect-the latter encoding the local electron temperature. This enables the first spatially resolved cryogenic imaging of both phenomena in graphene. Even under modest current bias, the electron temperature increases by nearly three orders of magnitude more than the lattice temperature, revealing strong electron-phonon decoupling and indicating a previously unrecognized electron cooling pathway. Our minimally invasive method is broadly applicable to van der Waals heterostructures and opens new avenues for probing energy dissipation and non-equilibrium transport in correlated and hydrodynamic electron systems.</description>

      <title>Landau levels of a Dirac electron in graphene from non-uniform magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics is well known when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Rashba spin-orbit coupling and artificially engineered topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Haloscope with a Disordered Dielectric Absorber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Near-surface Defects Break Symmetry in Water Adsorption on CeO$_{2-x}$(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Control of Diamond Color Center Charge States via Surface Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and -energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Tuning between a fractional topological insulator and competing phases at $\nu_\mathrm{T}=2/3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a spinful, time-reversal symmetric lowest Landau level model for a flatband quantum spin Hall system at total filling fraction $\nu_\mathrm{T}=2/3$. Such models are relevant, e.g. for spin-valley locked moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenides. The opposite Chern number of the two spins hinders the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet, instead favouring other phases. We study the phase diagram in dependence on different short-range Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$ and uncover several phases: A fractional topological insulator, a phase separated state, a spin-polarized fractional quantum Hall state, and the partially particle-hole transformed Halperin (111) state. The effect of the pseudopotentials $V_m$ depends on the parity of $m$, the relative angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Stern-Gerlach deflection of cryogenically cold polyatomic molecules in superfluid nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam deflection is capable of providing valuable information about the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters as well as the relaxation dynamics of their spins. However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>High Temperature Quantum Emission from Covalently Functionalized van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive nanomaterials for quantum information applications due to single photon emission (SPE) from atomic defects, primarily tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers. Defect and strain engineering techniques have been developed to yield high purity, deterministically positioned SPE in WSe2. However, a major challenge in application of these techniques is the low temperature required to observe defect-bound TMD exciton emission, typically limiting SPE to T&lt;30 K. SPE at higher temperatures either loses purity or requires integration into complex devices such as optical cavities. Here, 2D heterostructure engineering and molecular functionalization are combined to achieve high purity (&gt;90%) SPE in strained WSe2 persisting to over T=90 K. Covalent diazonium functionalization of graphite in a layered WSe2/graphite heterostructure maintains high purity up to T=90 K and single-photon source integrity up to T=115 K. This method preserves the best qualities of SPE from WSe2 while increasing working temperature to more than three times the typical range. This work demonstrates the versatility of surface functionalization and heterostructure design to synergistically improve the properties of quantum emission and offers new insights into the phenomenon of SPE from 2D materials.</description>

      <title>All-Dielectric Metasurface with a Two-Dimensional Locally Flat Photonic Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic flatbands offer promising light-matter interaction due to their unique slow-light nature. In recent years, flatbands have also attracted significant interest in optical engineering because of their angle-insensitive resonant characteristics. However, most photonic flatbands demonstrated to date occur only in one dimension and for a specific polarization, limiting their applicability. To date, no studies have reported the dispersionless behavior of flatbands under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles. Here, we present a two-dimensional photonic flatband created using a silicon metasurface with a Lieb lattice structure which demonstrates a locally flat photonic band for both TE- and TM- polarized light. Employing Fourier imaging, we analyze its energy-momentum dispersion under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles, demonstrating dispersionless flatbands up to +/-60{\deg} or +/-10{\deg}, depending on the polarization state and incident angle. This geometry is adaptable for applications in local field enhancement, enhanced photodetection, and augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Mirror-mediated long-range coupling and robust phase locking of spatially separated exciton-polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice arrays have been shown to have great value as simulators for complicated mathematical problems. In all physical lattices so far, coupling is only between nearest neighbors or nearest plus next-nearest neighbors; the geometry of the lattice controls the couplings of the sites. Realizing independently tunable, long-range interactions between distant condensates is a prerequisite for scalable analogue spin machines but has so far been restricted to short-range geometric coupling. In this work we show that it is possible using two-dimensional lattices of polariton condensates to use the third dimension to arbitrarily select two sites to couple coherently. Light emitted in the vertical direction from a condensate at one site can be imaged and sent back into the system to impinge on a different condensate at an arbitrary distance. We demonstrate this for the case of two condensates, in which we first ensure that they have no coupling within the plane of the lattice, and then use external imaging to phase lock the two together. Phase-resolved interferometry confirms clearly visible interference fringes and deterministic phase locking even when direct, planar coupling is suppressed. Analytical modeling reveals complementary mechanisms underpinning the robust coherence. Because the mirror adds no cameras, modulators, or electronic processing, the condensate pair operates as a pure, high-bandwidth analog element. Extension to dense graphs via segmented micro-mirror arrays is therefore ultimately limited only by the field of view and numerical aperture of the imaging optics. Our scheme thus paves the way to reconfigurable, energy-efficient polaritonic hardware for optimization, classification, clustering, and other neuromorphic tasks at the speed of light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a versatile platform for manipulating atomic-scale topological spin textures. In this study, using first-principles and micromagnetic calculations, we demonstrate a reversible transition between magnetic skyrmions and bimerons in a MoTeI/In_2Se_3 multiferroic heterostructure. The physical origin lies in the reorientation of the easy axis of magnetic anisotropy, triggered by the reversal of ferroelectric polarization. We show that the transition operates effectively under both static and dynamic conditions, exhibiting remarkable stability and flexibility. Notably, this transition can be achieved entirely through electric control, without requiring any external magnetic field. Furthermore, we propose a binary encoding scheme based on the skyrmion-bimeron transition, presenting a promising path toward energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin texture of the hourglass fermions band network in BiInO$_3$ using density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry analysis. Hourglass fermions are of interest in spintronics due to their unique and robust band structure, as well as their potential applications in novel electronic devices. BiInO$_3$ exhibits non-symmorphic crystal symmetries, such as glide reflection and glide rotational symmetry, influencing its electronic properties. Through symmetry analysis, we explore the band crossings and spin textures along specific high-symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone. Our results reveal a fascinating hourglass-shaped band dispersion and spin polarisation governed by symmetry operations and spin-orbit interaction. We analyse the spin-splitting mechanisms, including Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, and suggest potential applications for spin-based devices. This study sheds light on the role of symmetry in crystals for fascinating spin properties of hourglass fermions in non-symmorphic materials, offering insights for future developments in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the electrical impact of atomic carbon impurities in MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides, a family of two-dimensional compounds, are of interest for a range of technological applications. MoS2, the most researched member of this family, is hexagonal, from which monolayers may be isolated. Under ambient conditions and during growth/processing, contamination by impurities can occur, of which carbon is significant due to its presence in the common growth techniques. We have performed extensive computational investigations of carbon point defects, examining substitutional and interstitial locations. Previously unreported thermodynamically stable configurations, four-fold co-ordinated mono-carbon and di-carbon substitutions of Mo, and a complex of carbon substitution of sulfur bound to interstitial sulfur have been identified. We find no evidence to support recent assertions that carbon defects are responsible for electrical doping of MoS2, finding all energetically favorable forms have only deep charge transition levels and would act as carrier traps. To aid unambiguous identification of carbon defects, we present electronic and vibrational data for comparison with spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</description>

Abstract: We report electrical measurements on hexagonal silicon-germanium (hex-SiGe), a group IV alloy with direct bandgap. Electrical contacts are formed by metal alloying and doping is achieved using ion implantation. The metastable hex-SiGe phase is successfully recovered after implantation by solid phase recrystallization. Independent of the metal used, contacts on n-type resulted in Schottky barriers due to Fermi level pinning of hex-SiGe. Overall, this constitutes a first step towards use of hex-SiGe for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system comprising two incoherently pumped quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a bimodal photonic crystal cavity. To account for the exciton-phonon interactions, we employ a time-convolutionless polaron-transformed master equation. Both resonant and off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission linewidth.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic response of materials serves as the foundation for a broad range of vital applications, including but not limited to imaging, sensing, as well as classical and quantum communications. Here we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, a fundamentally new regime of electromagnetic material response originating from inherent material nonlocality, leading to effective ``spooky action at a distance''. We show that by structuring materials on the scale of their inherent nonlocality, it becomes possible to reveal the ``primordial'' nonlocal response of the components and design materials with strong overall nonlocality, easily detectable at room temperatures and in realistic (lossy) materials. Designer primordial nonlocality offers a new dimension in controlling light-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: Advancing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology into the sub-1-nm angstr\"om-scale technology nodes is expected to involve alternative semiconductor channel materials, as silicon transistors encounter severe performance degradation at physical gate lengths below 10 nm. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for overcoming short-channel effects due to their atomically thin bodies, which inherently suppress electrostatic leakage and improve gate control in aggressively scaled field-effect transistors (FETs). Among the growing library of 2D materials, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family -- a synthetic septuple-layered materials -- has attracted increasing attention for its remarkable ambient stability, suitable bandgaps, and favorable carrier transport characteristics, making it a promising platform for next-generation transistors. While experimental realization of sub-10-nm 2D FETs remains technologically demanding, computational device simulation using first-principles density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function transport simulations provide a powerful and cost-effective route for exploring the performance limits and optimal design of ultrascaled FET. This review consolidates the current progress in the computational design of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. We review the physical properties of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ that makes them compelling candidates for transistor applications, as well as the simulated device performance and optimization strategy of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. Finally, we identify key challenges and research gaps, and outline future directions that could accelerate the practical deployment of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FET in the angstr\"om-scale CMOS era.</description>

      <title>New plasmon-like mode in PdTe$_{2}$: Raman scattering and memory function study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PdTe$_2$ is a type II Dirac semimetal that has garnered significant attention due to its intriguing electronic and topological properties. Here, we report temperature dependent Raman scattering study of PdTe$_2$ in the temperature range from 10 K to 300 K. Our study reveals emergence of a new unreported peak below 100 K, centered around 250 cm$^{-1}$. We argue that the new mode is not a phonon mode because the Raman spectra calculated using Density Functional Theory shows only two intense peaks at 85 $ cm^{-1}$ and 128 $cm^{-1}$. To ascertain the origin of this new peak, we constructed a microscopic model of electrons coupling to a single plasmon mode at 250 $cm^{-1}$ and using the memory function formalism, we obtained that the Raman relaxation rate is linear in frequency. We also performed phenomenological analysis of the Raman response from the experimental data and computed frequency dependent Raman relaxation rate, which is also found to exhibit a linear dependence on frequency. With the congruence of our theoretical and phenomenological results we could ascertain that the new mode observed at low temperatures is indeed a plasmon-like mode. Further, phonon frequencies and line widths of the two phonon modes exhibit anomalous behavior above 100 K.</description>

      <title>Effective K valley Hamiltonian for TMD bilayers under pressure and application to twisted bilayers with pressure-induced topological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19662v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on topologically non-trivial moir\'{e} bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study MoTe$_2$ bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering an untwisted bilayer system with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data were then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then apply our model to a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers - here, we assume rigid layers, which is a crucial simplification. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study signatures of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) bound to Josephson vortices in superconductor-three-dimensional topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junctions placed in a perpendicular magnetic field. First, using semiclassical analytical as well as numerical techniques, we calculate the spatially resolved supercurrent density carried by the low-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in the junction. Motivated by a recent experiment [Yue et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 094511 (2024)], we discuss if and how the presence of vortex MZMs is reflected in supercurrent measurements, showing that Fraunhofer signatures alone are not suitable to reliably detect vortex MZMs. Next, we propose two ways in which we believe supercurrent measurements could be complemented to further verify that the junction does indeed host MZMs. Explicitly, we discuss how additional Majorana signatures could be obtained by (1) mapping out the local density of states in the junction via scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, and (2) microwave spectroscopy of the spectrum of low-energy CdGM states in the junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the relation between the Chern number and quantum Hall effect, searching for observables of topological invariants has been an intriguing topic. Topological Hopf-link semimetals have attracted tremendous interest, in which the conduction and valence energy bands touch at linked nodal lines. However, it is challenging to identify this sophisticated topology. We propose to use the quantum oscillation in strong magnetic fields to probe the Hopf links. For a generic model of Hopf-link semimetal that captures the linked-trivial phase transition, we figure out the phase shifts of oscillation for all Fermi pockets in all magnetic-field directions, by presenting self-consistent results from the Fermi surface tomography, Landau fan diagram, and electrical resistivity. As the magnetic field is rotated, the phase shifts exhibit a unique pattern, which could help to identify Hopf links in real materials, such as those in Li$_2$NaN.</description>

      <title>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J &lt; 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered diode performance in a Majorana-quantum dot Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonreciprocal signatures of Josephson current (JC) in a quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction (JJ) that comprises of two periodically driven Kitaev chains (KCs) coupled with an intervening QD. The simultaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{IS}$) and the time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{TRS}$), indispensable for the Josephson diode effect (JDE), is achieved solely via the two Floquet drives that differ by a finite phase, which eventually results in a nonreciprocal current, and hence yields a finite JDE. It may be noted that the Floquet Majorana modes generated at both the far ends of the KCs (away from the QD) and adjacent to the QD junctions mediate the JC owing to a finite superconducting (SC) phase difference in the two KCs. We calculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase relation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet drive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore, additional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external gate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an SC switching device. Tuning different system parameters, such as the chemical potential of the KCs, Floquet frequency, the relative phase mismatch of the drives, and the gate voltage, our model shows the highest possible rectification to be around $70\%$. Summarizing, our study provides an alternative scenario, replacing the traditional usage of an external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling effects in a JD via asymmetrically driven Kitaev leads that entail Majorana-mediated transport.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dipolar-exchange spin wave spectrum in thin ferromagnetic bilayers with inplane magnetization, incorporating interlayer exchange coupling and intra- and interlayer dipolar interactions. In the continuum approximation we analyze the nonreciprocity of propagating magnetic stray fields emitted by spin waves as a function of the relative orientation of the layer magnetizations that are observable by magnetometry of synthetic antiferromagnets or weakly coupled type-A van der Waals antiferromagnetic bilayers as a function of an applied magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) is a key paradigm in semiconductor nanostructures and gives access to the spin physics. We report the direct observation of PSB with gate-dispersive reflectometry on double quantum dots with source-drain bias. The reservoir charge transitions are strongly modulated, turning on and off when entering and leaving the blockaded region, consistent with a simple model. Seen with holes in Ge and Si, the effects are enhanced with larger bias voltage and suppressed by magnetic field. This work lays the foundation for fast probing of spin physics and minimally invasive spin readout.</description>

Abstract: The transition dynamics of two-state systems with time-dependent energy levels, first considered by Landau, Zener, Majorana, and St\"uckelberg, is one of the basic models in quantum physics and has been used to describe various physical systems. We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to a substantial reduction of $P$, being possible even to achieve $P=0$ in an instructive extreme case, and also to large $P$ even in the absence of any anticrossing point. The partial LZ model can describe valley transition dynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization and the non-Hermitian skin effect are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are driven, respectively, by disorder and nonreciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate a delocalization-localization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between Anderson localization and the skin effect can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate that quantum jumps between the skin states and the Anderson-localized states occur in the theoretical model. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The voltage profile of the circuit exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the skin effect, while the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the circuit can be perceived via a predicted localization behavior near the excitation node, rather than exhibiting sudden non-Hermitian jumps, as observed in the tight-binding framework. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the output voltage of the circuit. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits, opening avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic systems such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient devices for information transfer and communication.</description>

      <title>Amplifying microwave pulses with a single qubit engine fueled by quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a useful task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies a practical usage of the energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Exciton--Hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridized States in hBN-encapsulated Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>

Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>
