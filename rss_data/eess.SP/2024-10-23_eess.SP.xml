      <title>Hawk: An Efficient NALM System for Accurate Low-Power Appliance Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NALM) aims to recognize individual appliance usage from the main meter without indoor sensors. However, existing systems struggle to balance dataset construction efficiency and event/state recognition accuracy, especially for low-power appliance recognition. This paper introduces Hawk, an efficient and accurate NALM system that operates in two stages: dataset construction and event recognition. In the data construction stage, we efficiently collect a balanced and diverse dataset, HawkDATA, based on balanced Gray code and enable automatic data annotations via a sampling synchronization strategy called shared perceptible time. During the event recognition stage, our algorithm integrates steady-state differential pre-processing and voting-based post-processing for accurate event recognition from the aggregate current. Experimental results show that HawkDATA takes only 1/71.5 of the collection time to collect 6.34x more appliance state combinations than the baseline. In HawkDATA and a widely used dataset, Hawk achieves an average F1 score of 93.94% for state recognition and 97.07% for event recognition, which is a 47. 98% and 11. 57% increase over SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, selected appliance subsets and the model trained from HawkDATA are deployed in two real-world scenarios with many unknown background appliances. The average F1 scores of event recognition are 96.02% and 94.76%. Hawk's source code and HawkDATA are accessible at https://github.com/WZiJ/SenSys24-Hawk.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal 3D Point Clouds from WiFi-CSI Data via Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint communication and sensing (JC\&amp;S) is emerging as a key component in 5G and 6G networks, enabling dynamic adaptation to environmental changes and enhancing contextual awareness for optimized communication. By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC\&amp;S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes a multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC\&amp;S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A 0.03${mm}^2$ 100-250MHz Charge-Pump or Amplifier-Less Integrating Sub-Sampling PLL for Ultra-low Power Communication and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clock generation is an essential part of wireless or wireline communication modules. To facilitate recent advancements in wireline-like communication and in-sensor computing modules at relatively lower data rates, ultra-low power, and accurate clock generation are of the utmost importance. This paper presents a unique implementation of integrating sub-sampling phase locked loop, which alleviates the usage of additional gain elements in the PLL and reduces the noise injection in the system. In this design, the ring oscillator-based PLL can operate a wide frequency range of 100-250MHz while consuming 0.03mm2 of area and 131.8$\mu W$ of power at 250MHz. The area-normalized figure of merit (FOM) of the integrating SSPLL is found to be -236, while showing a reference spur of -43.2dB.</description>

      <title>Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian's rank than random sampling while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving graph rank and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</description>

      <title>Real-time Sub-milliwatt Epilepsy Detection Implemented on a Spiking Neural Network Edge Inference Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure status of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at providing timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect interictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural network (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time preliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible pathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of epileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The SNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed to process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average power consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when deployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance when tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure detection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable devices in the future.</description>

      <title>Codebook Design and Performance Analysis for Wideband Beamforming in Terahertz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The codebook-based analog beamforming is appealing for future terahertz (THz) communications since it can generate high-gain directional beams with low-cost phase shifters via low-complexity beam training. However, conventional beamforming codebook design based on array response vectors for narrowband communications may suffer from severe performance loss in wideband systems due to the ``beam squint" effect over frequency. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a new codebook design method for analog beamforming in wideband THz systems. In particular, to characterize the analog beamforming performance in wideband systems, we propose a new metric termed wideband beam gain, which is given by the minimum beamforming gain over the entire frequency band given a target angle. Based on this metric, a wideband analog beamforming codebook design problem is formulated for optimally balancing the beamforming gains in both the spatial and frequency domains, and the performance loss of conventional narrowband beamforming in wideband systems is analyzed. To solve the new wideband beamforming codebook design problem, we divide the spatial domain into orthogonal angular zones each associated with one beam, thereby decoupling the codebook design into a zone division sub-problem and a set of beamforming optimization sub-problems each for one zone. For the zone division sub-problem, we propose a bisection method to obtain the optimal boundaries for separating adjacent zones. While for each of the per-zone-based beamforming optimization sub-problems, we further propose an efficient augmented Lagrange method (ALM) to solve it. Numerical results demonstrate the performance superiority of our proposed codebook design for wideband analog beamforming to the narrowband beamforming codebook and also validate our performance analysis.</description>

      <title>Double-Side Delay Alignment Modulation for Multi-User Millimeter Wave and TeraHertz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay alignment modulation (DAM) is an innovative broadband modulation technique well suited for millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. Leveraging the high spatial resolution and sparsity of multi-path channels, DAM mitigates inter-symbol interference (ISI) effectively, by aligning all multi-path components through a combination of delay pre/post-compensation and path-based beamforming. As such, ISI is eliminated while preserving multi-path power gains. In this paper, we explore multi-user double-side DAM with both delay pre-compensation at the transmitter and post-compensation at the receiver, contrasting with prior one-side DAM that primarily focuses on delay pre-compensation only. Firstly, we reveal the constraint for the introduced delays and the delay pre/post-compensation vectors tailored for multi-user double-side DAM, given a specific number of delay pre/post-compensations. Furthermore, we show that as long as the number of base station (BS)/user equipment (UE) antennas is sufficiently large, single-side DAM, where delay compensation is only performed at the BS/UE, is preferred than double-side DAM since the former results in less ISI to be spatially eliminated. Next, we propose two low-complexity path-based beamforming strategies based on the eigen-beamforming transmission and ISI-zero forcing (ZF) principles, respectively, based on which the achievable sum rates are studied. Simulation results verify that with sufficiently large BS/UE antennas, single-side DAM is sufficient. Furthermore, compared to the benchmark scheme of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multi-user BS-side DAM achieves higher spectral efficiency and/or lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).</description>

      <title>A Computational Harmonic Detection Algorithm to Detect Data Leakage through EM Emanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unintended electromagnetic emissions from electronic devices, known as EM emanations, pose significant security risks because they can be processed to recover the source signal's information content. Defense organizations typically use metal shielding to prevent data leakage, but this approach is costly and impractical for widespread use, especially in uncontrolled environments like government facilities in the wild. This is particularly relevant for IoT devices due to their large numbers and deployment in varied environments. This gives rise to a research need for an automated emanation detection method to monitor the facilities and take prompt steps when leakage is detected. To address this, in the preliminary version of this work [1], we collected emanation data from 3 types of HDMI cables and proposed a CNN-based detection method that provided 95% accuracy up to 22.5m. However, the CNN-based method has some limitations: hardware dependency, confusion among multiple sources, and struggle at low SNR. In this extended version, we augment the initial study by collecting emanation data from IoT devices, everyday electronic devices, and cables. Data analysis reveals that each device's emanation has a unique harmonic pattern with intermodulation products, in contrast to communication signals with fixed frequency bands, spectra, and modulation patterns. Leveraging this, we propose a harmonic-based detection method by developing a computational harmonic detector. The proposed method addresses the limitations of the CNN method and provides ~100 accuracy not only for HDMI emanation (compared to 95% in the earlier CNN-based method) but also for all other tested devices/cables in different environments.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>High-Order Associative Learning Based on Memristive Circuits for Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristive associative learning has gained significant attention for its ability to mimic fundamental biological learning mechanisms while maintaining system simplicity. In this work, we introduce a high-order memristive associative learning framework with a biologically realistic structure. By utilizing memristors as synaptic modules and their state information to bridge different orders of associative learning, our design effectively establishes associations between multiple stimuli and replicates the transient nature of high-order associative learning. In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments, our design achieves a 230% improvement in learning efficiency compared to previous works, with memristor power consumption in the synaptic modules remaining below 11 {\mu}W. In large-scale image recognition tasks, we utilize a 20*20 memristor array to represent images, enabling the system to recognize and label test images with semantic information at 100% accuracy. This scalability across different tasks highlights the framework's potential for a wide range of applications, offering enhanced learning efficiency for current memristor-based neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Frequency Selective Surface Analysis via End-to-End Model-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative end-to-end model-based deep learning approach for efficient electromagnetic analysis of high-dimensional frequency selective surfaces (FSS). Unlike traditional data-driven methods that require large datasets, this approach combines physical insights from equivalent circuit models with deep learning techniques to significantly reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Compared to previously introduced model-based learning approaches, the proposed method is trained end-to-end from the physical structure of the FSS (geometric parameters) to its electromagnetic response (S-parameters). Additionally, an improvement in phase prediction accuracy through a modified loss function is presented. Comparisons with direct models, including deep neural networks (DNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFN), demonstrate the superiority of the model-based approach in terms of computational efficiency, model size, and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Attitudes Towards Current and Future AI Applications for Computerised Interpretation of ECG: A Clinical Stakeholder Interview Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: To investigate clinicians' attitudes towards current automated interpretation of ECG and novel AI technologies and their perception of computer-assisted interpretation. Materials and Methods: We conducted a series of interviews with clinicians in the UK. Our study: (i) explores the potential for AI, specifically future 'human-like' computing approaches, to facilitate ECG interpretation and support clinical decision making, and (ii) elicits their opinions about the importance of explainability and trustworthiness of AI algorithms. Results: We performed inductive thematic analysis on interview transcriptions from 23 clinicians and identified the following themes: (i) a lack of trust in current systems, (ii) positive attitudes towards future AI applications and requirements for these, (iii) the relationship between the accuracy and explainability of algorithms, and (iv) opinions on education, possible deskilling, and the impact of AI on clinical competencies. Discussion: Clinicians do not trust current computerised methods, but welcome future 'AI' technologies. Where clinicians trust future AI interpretation to be accurate, they are less concerned that it is explainable. They also preferred ECG interpretation that demonstrated the results of the algorithm visually. Whilst clinicians do not fear job losses, they are concerned about deskilling and the need to educate the workforce to use AI responsibly. Conclusion: Clinicians are positive about the future application of AI in clinical decision-making. Accuracy is a key factor of uptake and visualisations are preferred over current computerised methods. This is viewed as a potential means of training and upskilling, in contrast to the deskilling that automation might be perceived to bring.</description>

      <title>Security Enhancement of Quantum Communication in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a transmission scheme for enhancing quantum communication security, aimed at improving the security of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN). Quantum teleportation achieves the transmission of quantum states through quantum channels. In simple terms, an unknown quantum state at one location can be reconstructed on a particle at another location. By combining classical Turbo coding with quantum Shor error-correcting codes, we propose a practical solution that ensures secure information transmission even in the presence of errors in both classical and quantum channels. To provide absolute security under SAGIN, we add a quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol to the current system. Specifically, by accounting for the practical scenario of eavesdropping in quantum channels, the QSDC protocol utilizes virtual entangled pairs to detect the presence of eavesdroppers. Consequently, the overall scheme guarantees both the reliability and absolute security of communication.</description>

      <title>A Unified Activity Detection Framework for Massive Access: Beyond the Block-Fading Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wireless channel changes continuously with time and frequency and the block-fading assumption, which is popular in many theoretical analyses, never holds true in practical scenarios. This discrepancy is critical for user activity detection in grant-free random access, where joint processing across multiple coherence blocks is undesirable, especially when the environment becomes more dynamic. In this paper, we develop a framework for low-dimensional approximation of the channel to capture its variations over time and frequency, and use this framework to implement robust activity detection algorithms. Furthermore, we investigate how to efficiently estimate the principal subspace that defines the low-dimensional approximation. We also examine pilot hopping as a way of exploiting time and frequency diversity in scenarios with limited channel coherence, and extend our algorithms to this case. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate a substantial performance improvement achieved by our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Feature Attribution Methods for Electrocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of cardiac arrhythmia detection with electrocardiograms(ECGs) has been considerably improved since the introduction of deep learning models. In practice, the high performance alone is not sufficient and a proper explanation is also required. Recently, researchers have started adopting feature attribution methods to address this requirement, but it has been unclear which of the methods are appropriate for ECG. In this work, we identify and customize three evaluation metrics for feature attribution methods based on the characteristics of ECG: localization score, pointing game, and degradation score. Using the three evaluation metrics, we evaluate and analyze eleven widely-used feature attribution methods. We find that some of the feature attribution methods are much more adequate for explaining ECG, where Grad-CAM outperforms the second-best method by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Low-Coherence Sequence Design Under PAPR Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-coherence sequences with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) are crucial for multi-carrier wireless communication systems and are used for pilots, spreading sequences, and so on. This letter proposes an efficient low-coherence sequence design algorithm (LOCEDA) that can generate any number of sequences of any length that satisfy user-defined PAPR constraints while supporting flexible subcarrier assignments in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. We first visualize the low-coherence sequence design problem under PAPR constraints as resolving collisions between hyperspheres. By iteratively adjusting the radii and positions of these hyperspheres, we effectively generate low-coherence sequences that strictly satisfy the imposed PAPR constraints. Simulation results (i) confirm that LOCEDA outperforms existing methods, (ii) demonstrate its flexibility, and (iii) highlight its potential for various applications.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Holistic KLD-based Waveform Design for Multi-User-Multi-Target ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) metric to analyse and optimise performance trade-offs in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station that simultaneously serves communication user equipments (UEs) and detects multiple targets using a shared antenna deployment. We apply this framework to two widely used communication beamforming techniques, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF), to assess their impact on the radar subsystem's performance. Additionally, two optimisation problems are formulated: the first optimises the radar subsystem's KLD under communication constraints, and the second focuses on communication waveform KLD optimisation with constraints on the radar KLD. These problems are solved using a projected gradient method with adaptive penalties for the radar waveforms and a gradient-assisted interior point method (IPM) for the communication waveforms. Through theoretical derivations and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our KLD approach effectively characterises and optimises the performance trade-offs between sensing and communication in ISAC systems. The results show significant improvements in both radar detection and communication performance when compared to traditional MRT and ZF beamforming, and the identity covariance design for radar subsystems. These findings promote a more holistic design and optimisation of ISAC for next-generation wireless networks and demonstrate the advantages of KLD-based optimisation in balancing the performance of both sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Precise Ranging: Modeling Bias and Variance of Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging with TDoA Extraction under Multipath and NLOS Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Location-based services such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and indoor positioning require precise and scalable distance estimates. The bias and variance of range estimators inherently influence the resulting localization quality. In this work, we revisit the well-established Double-Sided Two-Way-Ranging (DS-TWR) protocol and the extraction of timing differences (DS-TDoA) at devices overhearing DS-TWR. Under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects, we analytically derive their bias and variance. Our proposed model reveals that DS-TWR retains half the variance than anticipated while DS-TDoA comprises roughly a five-fold increase in variance. We conduct numerical simulations and experimental deployments using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) devices in a public testbed. Our results confirm the adequacy of our model, providing centimeter-accurate predictions based on the underlying timestamping noise with a median $R^2$ score of 77% (30% IQR). We find that both DS-TWR and DS-TDoA exhibit reduced variance when response times are symmetric. Our experimental results further show that double-sided variants exhibit less error and variance compared to Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO)-based single-sided methods.</description>

      <title>Prior Information-Aided ADMM for Multi-User Detection in Codebook-Based Grant-Free NOMA: Dynamic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (CD-NOMA) systems offer key benefits such as high spectral efficiency, low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity. NOMA's ability to handle overloading allows multiple devices to share a single resource element (RE) for data transmission. In CD-NOMA, different users are assigned distinct codewords, which are leveraged during multi-user detection (MUD). Codebook-based NOMA systems outperform spread-sequence (SS)-based NOMA due to the coding gains provided by the codebooks. Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and dense code multiple access (DCMA) are two prominent examples of such systems. Additionally, NOMA is seen as a crucial technology for enabling grant-free access, especially in massive machine-type communications (mMTC). One of the main challenges in deploying grant-free NOMA systems is accurately detecting both user activity and transmitted data, particularly when user activity fluctuates dynamically across the transmission frame. This paper introduces codebook-based grant-free NOMA systems modeled using a block sparsity signal structure. The joint activity and data detection (JADD) problem in these systems is formulated as group LASSO and sparse group LASSO block compressive sensing (BCS) problems. To address these, a robust prior information-aided alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments and theoretical analysis show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, making it a suitable solution for mMTC networks.</description>

      <title>WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.</description>

      <title>Onboard Satellite Image Classification for Earth Observation: A Comparative Study of ViT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on identifying the most effective pre-trained model for land use classification in onboard satellite processing, emphasizing achieving high accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against noisy data conditions commonly encountered during satellite-based inference. Through extensive experimentation, we compare the performance of traditional CNN-based, ResNet-based, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 has excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 has proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite EO tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient RS-IC in satellite operations, achieving 98.76 % of accuracy, precision, and recall. Precisely, EfficientViT-M2 delivers the highest performance across all metrics, excels in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrates greater robustness (overall robustness score of 0.79). Consequently, EfficientViT-M2 consumes 63.93 % less power than MobileViTV2 (79.23 W) and 73.26 % less power than SwinTransformer (108.90 W). This highlights its significant advantage in energy efficiency.</description>
