      <title>A $\mu$-Analysis and Synthesis Framework for Partial Integral Equations using IQCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a $\mu$-analysis and synthesis framework for infinite-dimensional systems that leverages the Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) to compute the structured singular value's upper bound. The methodology formulates robust stability and performance conditions jointly as Linear Partial Integral Inequalities within the Partial Integral Equation framework, establishing connections between IQC multipliers and $\mu$-theory. Computational implementation via PIETOOLS enables computational tools that practically applicable to spatially distributed infinite dimensional systems. Illustrations with the help of Partial and Delay Differential Equations validate the effectiveness of the framework, showing a significant reduction in conservatism compared to unstructured methods and providing systematic tools for stability-performance trade-off analysis.</description>

      <title>How much can we save? Upper bound cost and emissions benefits from commercial and industrial load flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load shifting by commercial and industrial power consumers reduces costs and Scope 2 emissions for the consumer and the grid. Incentivizing this behavior requires tools for valuing flexibility amidst the heterogeneity in load characteristics across diverse sectors and the spatiotemporal variation in electricity prices and emissions factors. This work presents a top-down approach to screen and broadly understand the benefits of flexibility based on system uptime, power capacity (PC), energy capacity (EC), and round- trip efficiency (RTE). Depending on the region and season, cost savings from flexibility range from 0 to over 100% and emissions savings are generally bounded between 5-40%. We also find the magnitude and cost of emissions abatement from flexibility is highly variable and, in some cases, up to four orders of magnitude less than regional renewable energy credits or common investing or policy benchmarks like the social cost of carbon. While the value of flexibility is highly dynamic, estimating savings as a function of load characteristics and incentives can inform heuristic design of new systems, siting strategies, comparison of flexibility to other decarbonization options, and new avenues for incentivizing flexibility.</description>

      <title>DustNet: A Wireless Network of Ultrasonic Neural Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially distributed peripheral nerve recordings can be used to reconstruct motor intention and improve natural control of prosthetics in patients with limb deficiencies. However, many existing clinical solutions rely on percutaneous wires to access peripheral nerves; these sites are prone to infection and electrode degradation, preventing chronic use. To enable longterm recording of deeply-seated peripheral nerves, this paper presents DustNet: a network of ultrasonically-powered neural recording implants capable of supporting up to 8 simultaneously recording nodes over a single ultrasound link. To enable high throughput multi-implant communication, DustNet implements a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) protocol with up to 16-level amplitude modulation of the ultrasound backscatter that achieves up to 4x higher data rates than traditional on-off keying methods. Each neural implant consists of a 0.7x0.7x0.7 mm^3 piezoceramic transducer, a 10 nF off-chip capacitor, and an IC mounted on a flexible PCB. The implant IC was fabricated in a 28nm CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.43 mm^2. System functionality was verified within FDA power limits at 90mm depth, achieving a maximum data rate of 400 kb/s at 2 MHz ultrasound carrier frequency, with each implant transmitting uplink data at 50 kb/s and dissipating just 7 {\mu}W of power</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Federated Learning Control Framework Design for Smart Grid Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems remain highly vulnerable to disturbances and cyber-attacks, underscoring the need for resilient and adaptive control strategies. In this work, we investigate a data-driven Federated Learning Control (FLC) framework for transient stability resilience under cyber-physical disturbances. The FLC employs interpretable neural controllers based on the Chebyshev Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (ChebyKAN), trained on a shared centralized control policy and deployed for distributed execution. Simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus New England system show that the proposed FLC consistently achieves faster stabilization than distributed baselines at moderate control levels (10\%--60\%), highlighting its potential as a scalable, resilient, and interpretable learning-based control solution for modern power grids.</description>

      <title>Inverse optimal design of input-to-state stabilizing homogeneous controllers for nonlinear homogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the inverse optimality of input-to-state stabilizing controllers with input-output stability guarantees for nonlinear homogeneous systems. We formulate a new inverse optimal control problem, where the cost functional incorporates penalties on the output, in addition to the state, control and disturbance as in current related works. One benefit of penalizing the output is that the resulting inverse optimal controllers can ensure both input-to-state stability and input-output stability. We propose a technique for constructing the corresponding meaningful cost functional by using homogeneity properties, and provide sufficient conditions on solving the inverse optimal gain assignment problem. We show that homogeneous stabilizability of homogeneous systems in the case without disturbance is sufficient for the solvability of inverse optimal gain assignment problem for homogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven control of network systems: Accounting for communication adaptivity and security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, network systems have surged in significance, driven by merging technological advancements. These systems play pivotal roles in diverse applications ranging from autonomous driving to smart grids, yet they confront complexities arising from network imperfections and intricate interconnections, which challenge system identification, controller design, as well as stability and performance analysis. This survey provides an in-depth exploration of network systems from most recent data-driven perspective, across four key issues: communication delay, aperiodic sampling, network security, and distributed configurations. By doing so, this survey enhances our comprehension of the challenges and theoretical innovations within the realm of network systems.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part II: Nonmodular, Inverse Optimal, Adaptive, Prescribed/Fixed-Time and Safe Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the unicycle system, we provide constructive methods for the design of feedback laws that have one or more of the following properties: being nonmodular and globally exponentially stabilizing, inverse optimal, robust to arbitrary decrease or increase of input coefficients, adaptive, prescribed/fixed-time stabilizing, and safe (ensuring the satisfaction of state constraints). Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation. This article, along with its Part I, lays a broad constructive design foundation for stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle.</description>

      <title>Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.</description>

      <title>Transient Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Converters with Current Limiting Considering Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under asymmetrical faults, analyzing the transient stability of grid-forming voltage-source converters (GFM-VSCs) becomes essential because their behavior fundamentally differs from that under symmetrical faults. When current limiting is activated under asymmetrical faults, the point-of-common-coupling voltage of a GFM-VSC contains both positive- and negative-sequence components, and the interaction between these components generates a non-negligible negative-sequence-driven active power. However, the transient stability of GFM-VSCs under asymmetrical faults has not been sufficiently investigated, and the influence of negative-sequence-driven active power remains unclear. Accordingly, this letter derives the P-{\delta} curve of a GFM-VSC with an elliptical current limiter under asymmetrical faults by explicitly accounting for negative-sequence effects. This enables a more accurate transient stability assessment when extending conventional symmetrical-fault analyses to asymmetrical conditions. The theoretical analysis is validated by the agreement between the derived P-{\delta} curve and both simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Formulation and Experimental Validation of Price-Based Control of Flexible Prosumers in Distribution Grids with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a method for computing price signals for prosumers, incentivizing them to adjust their consumption according to the constraints of the distribution grids to which they are connected, thereby preventing voltage violations and line congestion. The proposed method leverages an interpretation of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which enables the extraction of a price signal to coordinate the operations of prosumers and the distribution grid's constraints while limiting the sharing of sensitive information among them. The method can be used by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to dynamically adjust a pre-existing retail electricity tariff (e.g., a constant or time-of-use tariff), thereby triggering grid-support actions from prosumers. The method is validated experimentally in a 9-node low-voltage distribution grid laboratory with real components (lines and controllable power converters). The experiments validate the algorithm's performance in terms of convergence and operational efficiency, demonstrating its viability in a real-life setting.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Modelling and Component Sizing in Renewable Energy Communities: A Participant Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes an optimization problem formulation to find the optimal sizes of Photovoltaics (PV) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for individual participants within the context of the Renewable Energy Community (REC). An optimization problem considered the dynamic nature of electricity pricing, solar irradiation levels, financial aspects such as capital investment, and operational and maintenance expenditures of PV and BESS. The analysis also considered replacement costs and the efficiency of charging and discharging the BESS unit. We employed Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) to determine the optimal system size that maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of individual participants. Furthermore, in this study, we used daily representative signals for each season of the year to reduce simulation runtime. The Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) was used to extract these signals. Then, these representative signals obtained were used in the optimization problem formulation to reduce simulation time and extend our analysis to a wider planning horizon. In addition, the study introduced fairness by applying the individual marginal contribution method to distribute incentives equitably among REC participants, ensuring that each member benefited from their contribution. A simulation study was conducted using a real demand dataset of five houses located in Roseto Valfortore, a small town and commune in the Foggia Province of the Apulia region in southern Italy, to demonstrate the practical relevance and usefulness of the ideas discussed. Ultimately, the goal of the article was to empower the REC with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and shape the future of sustainable energy.</description>

      <title>On the Contraction of Excitable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze contraction in conductance-based excitable systems and link it to reliable spike timing. For a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with synaptic input, we prove the unforced dynamics is incrementally exponentially stable on a compact physiological set. With impulsive inputs, contraction persists under an average dwell-time condition, and for periodic spike trains we derive an explicit lower bound on the inter-impulse period. In the high-rate limit the synapse is effectively held open, the conductance is nearly constant, and self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations can arise, so contraction no longer holds. This continuous-time view explains when spike times extracted by an event detector remain robust across trials, and simulations confirm both regimes.</description>

      <title>Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate -- based on the theory of upper-C1 functions -- the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. Accordingly, we propose to explore the parametric space with either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization, and to subsequently perform local exploitation with Sequential Quadratic Programming to compute Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: as in the state-of-art algorithm for standard robust control, identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. We show that the proposed method largely outperforms Monte-Carlo sampling alone, is able to reliably detect even rare worst-case configurations in minutes on a standard laptop, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations. Even in the unconstrained case, the proposed framework complements traditional methods, as it scales to plants with many parameters and states and explores the entire parametric space, albeit without formal guarantees of global optimality.</description>

      <title>Fast and Certified Bounding of Security-Constrained DCOPF via Interval Bound Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security-Constrained DC Optimal Power Flow (SC DCOPF) is an important tool for transmission system operators, enabling economically efficient and physically secure dispatch decisions. Although CPU-based commercial solvers (e.g., Gurobi) can efficiently solve SC-DCOPF problems with a reasonable number of security constraints, their performance degrades rapidly as both system size and the number of contingencies grow into thousands, leading to a significant computational burden. This introduces a bottleneck for system operators who seek timely decision-making across a wide range of potential threats. In this paper, we design a computational graph representation of the SC-DCOPF-based market-clearing problem, inspired by the third ARPA-E Grid Optimization Competition (GO3). We are able to quickly bound the optimal solution of large-scale SC-DCOPF problems using a GPU-accelerated Neural Network verification tool called Interval Bound Propagation (IBP). Using IBP, we compute certified bounds with a maximum gap of 6.53% for instances up to 617 buses, while demonstrating scalability on challenging systems up to 8,316 buses with a runtime of approximately 0.07 seconds. These results demonstrate that IBP can provide high-quality solution bounds at very fast speeds, and it can help identify infeasibility drivers in challenging SC-DCOPF instances.</description>

      <title>Economic Linear Quadratic MPC With Non-Unique Optimal Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic stability in economic receding horizon control can be obtained under a strict dissipativity assumption, related to positive-definiteness of a so-called rotated cost, and through the use of suitable terminal cost and constraints. In the linear-quadratic case, a common assumption is that the rotated cost is positive definite. The positive semi-definite case has received surprisingly little attention, and the connection to the standard dissipativity assumption has not been investigated. In this paper, we fill this gap by connecting existing results in economic model predictive control with the stability results for the semi-definite case, the properties of the constrained generalized discrete algebraic Riccati equation, and of two optimal control problems. Moreover, we extend recent results relating exponential stability to the choice of terminal cost in the absence of terminal constraints.</description>

Abstract: There is already a method known from the literature with which it is possible to measure both the transfer function and the noise power spectral density of the superimposed noise at the output of a disturbed, time-invariant, real system with nonlinearities in one measurement. By using a suitable window, the frequency selectivity of the measurement of the power spectral density of the superimposed noise can be noticeably improved without significantly increasing the computational complexity of the method. The unbiasedness and consistency of the measurement method with a suitable window are proven. The measurement of the power spectral density of a zero-mean, stationary process without measuring the transfer function is investigated as a special case for both real-valued and complex-valued signals. It is derived which requirements a suitable window should meet and how it can be calculated with high numerical accuracy.

Durch den Einsatz eines geeigneten Fensters kann die Frequenzselektivitaet der Messung des Leistungsdichtespektrums der Stoerung deutlich verbessert werden, ohne den Aufwand der Berechnungen des Verfahrens nennenswert zu erhoehen. Die Erwartungstreue und die Konsistenz des Messverfahren mit Fensterung wird gezeigt. Die Messung des Leistungsdichtespektrums eines mittelwertfreien, stationaeren Prozesses ohne Messung der Uebertragungsfunktion wird als Sonderfall sowohl fuer reellwertige, als auch fuer komplexwertige Signale untersucht. Es wird hergeleitet, welche Forderungen ein geeignetes Fenster erfuellen sollte und wie es sich numerisch hochgenau berechnen laesst.</description>

Abstract: The method described in the first part for frequency-selectively measuring the transfer function and the noise power spectral density of the superimposed noise at the output of a disturbed, real system with nonlinearities using windowing was limited to time-invariant systems with stationary and zero-mean processes. Here, we investigate how this measurement method can be extended so that all correlations existing between the input and output signals can also be measured using windowing for a periodically time-varying system disturbed by a cyclostationary noise process. An extended version of the window construction algorithm presented in the first part is introduced, in which some degrees of freedom not used there can be used to appropriately influence the properties of the window sequence depending on the application.

      <title>GeoShield: Byzantine Fault Detection and Recovery for Geo-Distributed Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as railway control systems and smart grids, consist of geographically distributed subsystems that are connected via unreliable, asynchronous inter-region networks. Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS.
  We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness. It is the first bounded-time recovery solution that operates effectively under unreliable networks without relying on trusted hardware. Evaluations using real-world case studies show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spatially Consistent Air-to-Ground Channel Modeling and Simulation via 3D Shadow Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach for spatially-consistent semi-deterministic Air-to-Ground (A2G) channel modeling in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-assisted networks. We use efficient 3D building shadow projections to determine Line-of-Sight (LOS) regions, enabling fast generation of LOS maps. By integrating LOS-aware deterministic path loss with stochastic shadow fading, the approach produces spatially consistent A2G radio maps suitable for environment- and mobility-aware channel evaluation and performance prediction. Simulation results in ITU-compliant Manhattan grid environments demonstrate the model's ability to reflect key urban propagation characteristics, such as LOS blockage patterns and outage behavior. The proposed approach provides an efficient alternative to ray tracing or fully stochastic models, with particular relevance for user mobility, link planning, and radio map generation in 6G non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>NMPC-based Motion Planning with Adaptive Weighting for Dynamic Object Interception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catching fast-moving objects serves as a benchmark for robotic agility, posing significant coordination challenges for cooperative manipulator systems holding a catcher, particularly due to inherent closed-chain constraints. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner that bridges high-level interception planning with real-time joint space control, enabling dynamic object interception for systems comprising two cooperating arms. We introduce an Adaptive- Terminal (AT) MPC formulation featuring cost shaping, which contrasts with a simpler Primitive-Terminal (PT) approach relying heavily on terminal penalties for rapid convergence. The proposed AT formulation is shown to effectively mitigate issues related to actuator power limit violations frequently encountered with the PT strategy, yielding trajectories and significantly reduced control effort. Experimental results on a robotic platform with two cooperative arms, demonstrating excellent real time performance, with an average planner cycle computation time of approximately 19 ms-less than half the 40 ms system sampling time. These results indicate that the AT formulation achieves significantly improved motion quality and robustness with minimal computational overhead compared to the PT baseline, making it well-suited for dynamic, cooperative interception tasks.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Dynamic Programming for Multistage Stochastic Energy Storage Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated dynamic programming (DP) method for valuing, operating, and bidding energy storage under multistage stochastic electricity prices. Motivated by computational limitations in existing models, we formulate DP backward induction entirely in tensor-based algebraic operations that map naturally onto massively parallel GPU hardware. Our method accommodates general, potentially non-concave payoff structures, by combining a discretized DP formulation with a convexification procedure that produces market-feasible, monotonic price-quantity bid curves. Numerical experiments using ISO-NE real-time prices demonstrate up to a 100x speedup by the proposed GPU-based DP method relative to CPU computation, and an 8,000x speedup compared to a commercial MILP solver, while retaining sub-0.3% optimality gaps compared to exact benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Assessing Power Flow Controllability via Variable Line Reactance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large data center loads and inverter-based generation is increasing the stress on transmission networks, while expanding grid capacity at the required pace remains challenging. Power flow controllers (PFCs) that adjust effective line reactances to redistribute flows are often viewed as an interim solution to improve transmission network utilization. Traditional flexibility metrics and analysis approaches for PFCs focus on a limited number of operating points and contingencies. Towards gaining system-wide insights, this paper introduces a framework to quantify network flow controllability- the extent to which line flows can be reshaped through reactance adjustments. We derive analytical results demonstrating that installing PFCs on all lines enables complete controllability of feasible flow patterns. Building on these, we conduct empirical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system to examine how controllability varies with the number of PFCs and their reactance adjustment range. These analyses employ a mixed-integer linear program to optimize the siting and sizing of PFCs. Finally, we validate findings under AC power flow physics using an optimization routine that steers flows toward desired setpoints.</description>

      <title>DiffOP: Reinforcement Learning of Optimization-Based Control Policies via Implicit Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world control systems require policies that are not only high-performing but also interpretable and robust. A promising direction toward this goal is model-based control, which learns system dynamics and cost functions from historical data and then uses these models to inform decision-making. Building on this paradigm, we introduce DiffOP, a novel framework for learning optimization-based control policies defined implicitly through optimization control problems. Without relying on value function approximation, DiffOP jointly learns the cost and dynamics models and directly optimizes the actual control costs using policy gradients. To enable this, we derive analytical policy gradients by applying implicit differentiation to the underlying optimization problem and integrating it with the standard policy gradient framework. Under standard regularity conditions, we establish that DiffOP converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffOP through experiments on nonlinear control tasks and power system voltage control with constraints. The code is available at https://github.com/alwaysbyx/DiffOP.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Conservatism in Safety-Critical Control for Input-Delayed Systems via Adaptive Delay Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Input delays affect systems such as teleoperation and wirelessly autonomous connected vehicles, and may lead to safety violations. One promising way to ensure safety in the presence of delay is to employ control barrier functions (CBFs), and extensions thereof that account for uncertainty: delay adaptive CBFs (DaCBFs). This paper proposes an online adaptive safety control framework for reducing the conservatism of DaCBFs. The main idea is to reduce the maximum delay estimation error bound so that the state prediction error bound is monotonically non-increasing. To this end, we first leverage the estimation error bound of a disturbance observer to bound the state prediction error. Second, we design two nonlinear programs to update the maximum delay estimation error bound satisfying the prediction error bound, and subsequently update the maximum state prediction error bound used in DaCBFs. The proposed method ensures the maximum state prediction error bound is monotonically non-increasing, yielding less conservatism in DaCBFs. We verify the proposed method in an automated connected truck application, showing that the proposed method reduces the conservatism of DaCBFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide detailed and physically accurate representation of indoor airflow, their high computational cost limits their use in real-time building control. In this work, we present a neural operator learning framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable building ventilation control with the high-fidelity fluid dynamics models. Our method jointly optimizes the airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train an ensemble of neural operator transformer models to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow fields using high-resolution CFD data. This learned neural operator is then embedded in an optimization-based control framework for building ventilation control. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, as well as data-driven control methods using spatially averaged CO2 prediction and deep learning based reduced order model, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method in maintaining energy efficiency and indoor air quality in real-world buildings.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a sliding mode controller using the backstepping approach. The controller is employed to synthesize tracking errors and Lyapunov functions. A novel state-space representation is formulated by incorporating the dynamics of the quadrotor and accounting for non-holonomic constraints. The proposed sliding mode controller effectively addresses system nonlinearities and improves tracking of predefined trajectories. Simulation results are presented graphically to demonstrate the controller's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the actual cause of events in engineered systems is a fundamental challenge in system analysis. Finding such causes becomes more challenging in the presence of noise and stochastic behavior in real-world systems. In this paper, we adopt the notion of probabilistic actual causality by Fenton-Glynn, which is a probabilistic extension of Halpern and Pearl's actual causality, and propose a novel method to formally reason about causal effect of events in stochastic systems. We (1) formulate the discovery of probabilistic actual causes in computing systems as an SMT problem, and (2) address the scalability challenges by introducing an abstraction-refinement technique that improves efficiency by up to 95%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies, identifying probabilistic actual causes of safety violations in (1) the Mountain Car problem, (2) the Lunar Lander benchmark, and (3) MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of control systems for the spatial self-organization of mobile agents is an open challenge across several engineering domains, including swarm robotics and synthetic biology. Here, we propose a bio-inspired leader-follower solution, which is aware of energy constraints of mobile agents and is apt to deal with large swarms. Akin to many natural systems, control objectives are formulated for the entire collective, and leaders and followers are allowed to plastically switch their role in time. We frame a density control problem, modeling the agents' population via a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This approach allows for a compact description that inherently avoids the curse of dimensionality and improves analytical tractability. We derive analytical guarantees for the existence of desired steady-state solutions and their local stability for one-dimensional and higher-dimensional problems.

      <title>Artifacts Are Not Noise: Embodied Resonance and the 70% Signal Loss in Conventional EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current AI systems excel at pattern recognition but fail at causal reasoning. We argue this is not an engineering limitation but reveals something fundamental about the nature of understanding itself. We propose that causal cognition requires a specific physical architecture: stochastic, coupled oscillators with whole-system coordination. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500 plus trials) from a P300 target recognition task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization and compared it to standard voltage (ERP) and coherence (ITC) metrics. Four findings establish the framework. Phase and voltage are globally independent (r of 0.048) yet strongly trial-coupled (r of 0.590), proving R captures hidden cognitive structure. Voltage precedes phase by 293 ms, revealing sequential computation. Frequency decomposition shows Theta (169 ms), Alpha (286 ms), and Beta (777 ms) cascade. Our metric is distinct from standard ITC (r of 0.155). Then we tested the standard assumption. Conventional artifact rejection removes eye movements, muscle activity, and autonomic signals before analysis. The standard model assumes cognition is neural activity plus noise. We ran the identical analysis with and without rejection. Removing artifacts reduced the trial-level correlation threefold (from 0.590 to 0.195). Target discrimination reversed sign (from positive 0.6 percent to negative 0.4 percent). What we discard as noise is 70 percent of the signal. This falsifies the standard model. Cognition is not isolated neural computation. It is whole-body phase synchronization spanning neural, muscular, and autonomic systems. For AI, the implications are direct: embodied sensorimotor integration is not optional. It is the substrate that makes understanding possible.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven method to find a closed-loop optimal controller, which minimizes a specified infinite-horizon cost function for systems with unknown dynamics. Suppose the closed-loop optimal controller can be parameterized by a given class of functions, hereafter referred to as the policy. The proposed method introduces a novel gradient estimation framework, which approximates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the policy parameters via integrating the Koopman operator with the classical concept of actor-critic. This enables the policy parameters to be tuned iteratively using gradient descent to achieve an optimal controller, leveraging the linearity of the Koopman operator. The convergence analysis of the proposed framework is provided. The control performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations compared with classical optimal control methods that usually assume the dynamics are known.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Safe Robotic Grasping with Tactile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic grasping requires safe force interaction to prevent a grasped object from being damaged or slipping out of the hand. In this vein, this paper proposes an integrated framework for grasping with formal safety guarantees based on Control Barrier Functions. We first design contact force and force closure constraints, which are enforced by a safety filter to accomplish safe grasping with finger force control. For sensory feedback, we develop a technique to estimate contact point, force, and torque from tactile sensors at each finger. We verify the framework with various safety filters in a numerical simulation under a two-finger grasping scenario. We then experimentally validate the framework by grasping multiple objects, including fragile lab glassware, in a real robotic setup, showing that safe grasping can be successfully achieved in the real world. We evaluate the performance of each safety filter in the context of safety violation and conservatism, and find that disturbance observer-based control barrier functions provide superior performance for safety guarantees with minimum conservatism.</description>

      <title>OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With over 760 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The framework combines structure-preserving embeddings with graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics while enhancing interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme guarantees compliance with both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model and regional inflation network dynamics, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics in time-delay systems: polynomial $\beta$-control in a pressing process and connections to blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a press control problem in straightening machines with small time delays due to system communication. To handle this, we propose a generalized $\beta$-control method, which replaces conventional linear velocity control with a polynomial of degree $\beta \ge 1$. The resulting model is a delay differential equation (DDE), for which we derive basic properties through nondimensionalization and analysis. Numerical experiments suggest the existence of a threshold initial velocity separating overshoot and non-overshoot dynamics, which we formulate as a conjecture. Based on this, we design a control algorithm under velocity constraints and confirm its effectiveness. We also highlight a connection between threshold behavior and finite-time blow-up in DDEs. This study provides a practical control strategy and contributes new insights into threshold dynamics and blow-up phenomena in delay systems.</description>

      <title>Uniform Sampling from the Reachable Set Using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the reachable set of a dynamical system is a fundamental problem in control theory, particularly when control inputs are bounded. Direct simulation using randomly sampled admissible controls often leads to trajectories that cluster near attractors, resulting in poor coverage of the reachable set. To achieve a more uniform distribution of terminal states, we formulate the problem within an Optimal Transport (OT) framework. In this setting, the goal is to steer the system so that the final state distribution, determined by the chosen controls and initial conditions, matches a desired target distribution. Enforcing this condition exactly is not possible since the reachable set is not known. So we introduce an $L_2$-norm based regularization of the terminal distribution that relaxes the constraint while promoting uniform coverage. The resulting formulation can be approximated by a finite-dimensional, particle-based optimal control problem with kernel-coupled terminal cost. We show that this approach converges to the original formulation and demonstrate through numerical examples that it provides significantly more uniform reachable-set sampling than random control strategies.</description>

      <title>Flexibility aggregation via set projection for distribution grids with multiple interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing number of flexible energy devices in distribution grids, coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) becomes critical for optimal system operation. One form of coordination is to solve the overall system operation problem in a hierarchical way, computing Feasible Operational Regions (FORs) for the interconnection between TSO/DSO. Most methods for computing FORs rely on the assumption of only one interconnection point between TSO and DSOs, which is often violated in practice. In this work, we propose a method for computing FORs in distribution grids with multiple interconnection points to the transmission grid. We test our method in a grid with two interconnecting points and analyze the properties of the resulting high-dimensional FOR from a power systems perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-disaster situations pose unique navigation challenges. One of those challenges is the unstructured nature of the environment, which makes it hard to layout paths for rescue vehicles. We propose the use of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in such scenario to perform reconnaissance across the environment. To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.</description>
