      <title>Mobility and Threshold Voltage Extraction in Transistors with Gate-Voltage-Dependent Contact Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobility of emerging (e.g., two-dimensional, oxide, organic) semiconductors is commonly estimated from transistor current-voltage measurements. However, such devices often experience contact gating, i.e., electric fields from the gate modulate the contact resistance during measurements, which can lead conventional extraction techniques to estimate mobility incorrectly even by a factor &gt;2. This error can be minimized by measuring transistors at high gate-source bias, |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, but this regime is often inaccessible in emerging devices that suffer from high contact resistance or early gate dielectric breakdown. Here, we propose a method of extracting mobility in transistors with gate-dependent contact resistance that does not require operation at high |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, enabling accurate mobility extraction even in emerging transistors with strong contact gating. Our approach relies on updating the transfer length method (TLM) and can achieve &lt;10% error even in regimes where conventional techniques overestimate mobility by &gt;2$\times$.</description>

      <title>Depth-Resolved Characterization of Centrifugal Disk Finishing of Additively Manufactured Inconel 718</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface characteristics are a major contributor to the in-service performance, particularly fatigue life, of additively manufactured (AM) components. Centrifugal disk finishing (CDF) is one of many rigid media, abrasive machining processes employed to smooth the surfaces and edges of AM components. Within the general family of abrasive machining processes currently applied to AM, CDF is moderate in terms of material removal rate and the inertial forces exerted. How CDF alters the underlying microstructure of the processed surface is currently unknown. Here we employ profilometry and high-energy X-ray diffraction to characterize surface finish, crystallographic texture, and anisotropic distributions of residual microscale strain as a function of depth in CDF-finished Inconel 718 manufactured with laser powder bed fusion. Surfaces are finished using both unimodal and bimodal finishing media size distributions. We find that CDF will remove surface textures from AM components, but generally not alter the bulk texture. CDF is also found to impart significant amounts of residual microscale strain into the first 100 $\mu$m from the sample surface.</description>

      <title>Thermal Performance of a Liquid-cooling Assisted Thin Wickless Vapor Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing need for power consumption in electronic devices, coupled with the requirement for thinner size, calls for the development of efficient heat spreading components. Vapor chambers (VCs), because of their ability to effectively spread heat over a large area by two-phase heat transfer, seem ideal for such applications. However, creating thin and efficient vapor chambers that work over a wide range of power inputs is a persisting challenge. VCs that use wicks for circulating the phase changing media, suffer from capillary restrictions, dry-out, clogging, increase in size and weight, and can often be costly. Recent developments in wick-free wettability patterned vapor chambers replace traditional wicks with laser-fabricated wickless components. An experimental setup allows for fast testing and experimental evaluation of water-charged VCs with liquid-assisted cooling. The sealed chamber can maintain vacuum for long durations, and can be used for testing of very thin wick-free VCs. This work extends our previous study by decreasing overall thickness of the wick-free VC down to 3 mm and evaluates its performance. Furthermore, the impact of wettability patterns on VC performance is investigated, by carrying out experiments both in non-patterned and patterned VCs. Experiments are first carried out on a wick-free VC with no wettability patterns and comprising of an entirely superhydrophilic evaporator coupled with a hydrophobic condenser. Thereafter, wettability patterns that aid the rapid return of water to the heated site on the evaporator and improve condensation on the condenser of the vapor chamber are implemented. The thermal characteristics show that the patterned VCs outperform the non-patterned VCs under all scenarios. The patterned VCs exhibit low thermal resistance independent of fluid charging ratio withstanding higher power inputs without thermal dry-outs.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically-enhanced Schottky barrier transistors for Logic-in-Memory applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have had an enormous impact on a multitude of sectors, from research to industry, generating an unprecedented demand for tailor-suited hardware platforms. Their training and execution is highly memory-intensive, clearly evidencing the limitations affecting the currently available hardware based on the von Neumann architecture, which requires frequent data shuttling due to the physical separation of logic and memory units. This does not only limit the achievable performances but also greatly increases the energy consumption, hindering the integration of ANNs into low-power platforms. New Logic in Memory (LiM) architectures, able to unify memory and logic functionalities into a single component, are highly promising for overcoming these limitations, by drastically reducing the need of data transfers. Recently, it has been shown that a very flexible platform for logic applications can be realized recurring to a multi-gated Schottky-Barrier Field Effect Transistor (SBFET). If equipped with memory capabilities, this architecture could represent an ideal building block for versatile LiM hardware. To reach this goal, here we investigate the integration of a ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO) layer onto Dual Top Gated SBFETs. We demonstrate that HZO polarization charges can be successfully employed to tune the height of the two Schottky barriers, influencing the injection behavior, thus defining the transistor mode, switching it between n and p-type transport. The modulation strength is strongly dependent on the polarization pulse height, allowing for the selection of multiple current levels. All these achievable states can be well retained over time, thanks to the HZO stability. The presented result show how ferroelectric-enhanced SBFETs are promising for the realization of novel LiM hardware, enabling low-power circuits for ANNs execution.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spalling of Single Crystal 4H-SiC Bulk Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail several scientific and engineering innovations which enable the controlled spalling of 10 - 50 micron thick films of single crystal 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) from bulk substrates. 4H-SiC's properties, including high thermal conductivity and a wide bandgap, make it an ideal candidate for high-temperature, high-voltage power electronic devices. Moreover, 4H-SiC has been shown to be an excellent host of solid-state atomic defect qubits for quantum computing and quantum networking. Because 4H-SiC single crystal substrates are expensive (due to long growth times and limited yield), techniques for removal and transfer of layers in the tens-of-microns thickness range are highly desirable for substrate reuse and heterogenous integration of separated layers. In this work we utilize novel approaches for stressor layer thickness control and spalling crack initiation to demonstrate controlled spalling of 4H-SiC, the highest fracture toughness material spalled to date. Additionally, we demonstrate substrate re-use, bonding of the spalled films to carrier substrates, and explore the spin coherence of the spalled films. In preliminary studies we are able to achieve coherent spin control of neutral divacancy ($VV^{0}$) qubit ensembles and measure a spin T2* of 0.581 $\mu$s in such spalled films.</description>

      <title>Room temperature realization of artificial chiral magnets with reprogrammable magnon nonreciprocity at zero field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnets are materials which possess unique helical arrangements of magnetic moments, which give rise to nonreciprocal transport and fascinating physics phenomena. On the one hand, their exploration is guided by the prospects of unconventional signal processing, computation schemes and magnetic memory. On the other hand, progress in applications is hindered by the challenging materials synthesis, limited scalability and typically low critical temperature. Here, we report the creation and exploration of artificial chiral magnets (ACMs) at room temperature. By employing a mass production compatible deposition technology, we synthesize ACMs, which consist of helical Ni surfaces on central cylinders. Using optical microscopy, we reveal nonreciprocal magnon transport at GHz frequencies. It is controlled by programmable toroidal moments which result from the ACM's geometrical handedness and field-dependent spin chirality. We present materials-by-design rules which optimize the helically curved ferromagnets for 3D nonreciprocal transport at room temperature and zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Thermal Performance of a Wick-free Vapor Chamber in Power Electronics Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient thermal management in high-power electronics cooling can be achieved using phase-change heat transfer devices, such as vapor chambers. Traditional vapor chambers use wicks to transport condensate for efficient thermal exchange and to prevent "dry-out" of the evaporator. However, wicks in vapor chambers present significant design challenges arising out of large pressure drops across the wicking material, which slows down condensate transport rates and increases the chances for dry-out. Thicker wicks add to overall thermal resistance, while deterring the development of thinner devices by limiting the total thickness of the vapor chamber. Wickless vapor chambers eliminate the use of metal wicks entirely, by incorporating complementary wettability-patterned flat plates on both the evaporator and the condenser side. Such surface modifications enhance fluid transport on the evaporator side, while allowing the chambers to be virtually as thin as imaginable, thereby permitting design of thermally efficient thin electronic cooling devices. While wick-free vapor chambers have been studied and efficient design strategies have been suggested, we delve into real-life applications of wick-free vapor chambers in forced air cooling of high-power electronics. An experimental setup is developed wherein two Si-based MOSFETs of TO-247-3 packaging having high conduction resistance, are connected in parallel and switched at 100 kHz, to emulate high frequency power electronics operations. A rectangular copper wick-free vapor chamber spreads heat laterally over a surface 13 times larger than the heating area. This chamber is cooled externally by a fan that circulates air at room temperature. The present experimental setup extends our previous work on wick-free vapor chambers, while demonstrating the effectiveness of low-cost air cooling in vapor-chamber enhanced high-power electronics applications.</description>

      <title>High-precision chemical quantum sensing in flowing monodisperse microdroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel flow-based method for high-precision chemical detection that integrates quantum sensing with droplet microfluidics. We deploy nanodiamond particles hosting fluorescent nitrogen vacancy defects as quantum sensors in flowing, monodisperse, picoliter-volume microdroplets containing analyte molecules. ND motion within these microcompartments facilitates close sensor-analyte interaction and mitigates particle heterogeneity. Microdroplet flow rates are rapid (upto 4cm/s) and with minimal drift. Pairing this controlled flow with microwave control of NV electronic spins, we introduce a new noise-suppressed mode of Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance that is sensitive to chemical analytes while resilient against experimental variations, achieving detection of analyte-induced signals at an unprecedented level of a few hundredths of a percent of the ND fluorescence. We demonstrate its application to detecting paramagnetic ions in droplets with simultaneously low limit-of-detection and low analyte volumes, in a manner significantly better than existing technologies. This is combined with exceptional measurement stability over &gt;103s and across hundreds of thousands of droplets, while utilizing minimal sensor volumes and incurring low ND costs (&lt;$0.70 for an hour of operation). Additionally, we demonstrate using these droplets as micro-confinement chambers by co-encapsulating ND quantum sensors with analytes, including single cells. This versatility suggests wide-ranging applications, like single-cell metabolomics and real-time intracellular measurements in bioreactors. Our work paves the way for portable, high-sensitivity, amplification-free, chemical assays with high throughput; introduces a new chemical imaging tool for probing chemical reactions in microenvironments; and establishes the foundation for developing movable, arrayed quantum sensors through droplet microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Observation of strain-rate softening behavior in jammed granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strain-rate sensitivity of confined granular materials has been widely explored, with most findings exhibiting rate-strengthening behaviors. This study, however, reveals a distinct rate-softening behavior across a certain strain rate range based on triaxial tests on particle clusters of various materials with different surface properties, particle sizes, shapes, and stiffness. This softening effect is especially pronounced in the case of common rice particles. By examining the behavior of rice particles under different confining pressure and surface conditions, and directly measuring the frictional coefficient across various loading rates, we find that the reduction in surface frictional coefficient with the increasing strain rate predominantly contributes to this rate-softening behavior. This conclusion is validated by results from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. Additionally, we identify confining pressure as a critical factor regulating the normal stress between particles, and thereby enhancing frictional behavior. Rheometer tests reveal that the shear modulus exhibits a similar rate-softening trend. This study of rate-softening behavior in granular materials enhances our understanding of the mechanisms during their deformation under confining pressure. It also suggests that local inter-particle tribology significantly impacts overall granular behavior.</description>

      <title>Assessment of physical schemes for WRF model in convection-permitting mode over southern Iberian Peninsula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection-permitting models (CPMs) enable the representation of meteorological variables at horizontal high resolution spatial scales (higher than 4 km), where convection plays a significant role. Physical schemes need to be evaluated considering factors in the studied region such as orography and climate variability. This study investigates the sensitivity of the WRF model as CPM to the use of different physics schemes on Andalusia, a complex orography region in southern Iberian Peninsula (IP). A set of 1-year WRF simulations was completed based on two one-way nested domains: the parent domain (d01) spanning the entire IP with 5 km spatial resolution and the nested domain (d02) for the region of Andalusia at 1 km of spatial resolution. 12 physic schemes were examined from combinations of microphysics (MP) schemes including THOMPSON, WRF single moment 6-class (WSM6), and WRF single moment 7-class (WSM7), and different options for the convection in d01, the Grell 3D (G3), Grell-Freitas (GF), Kain-Fritsch (KF), and deactivated cumulus parameterization (OFF). The simulated precipitation and 2-m temperature for the year 2018, a very wet year, were compared with observational datasets to determine the optimal WRF configuration, including point-to-point and station-point comparisons at different time aggregations. In general, greater differences were shown when comparing the results of convection schemes in d01. Simulations completed with GF or OFF presented better performance compared to the reference datasets. Concerning the MP, although THOMPSON showed a better fit in high mountain areas, it generally presents a worse agreement with the reference datasets. In terms of temperature, the results were very similar and, therefore, the selection of the best configuration was based mainly on the precipitation results with the WSM7-GF scheme being suitable for Andalusia region.</description>

      <title>Toward thermoelectric characterization of (nano)materials by in situ transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to perform an in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand the interplay between the thermoelectric properties on one side and the structure/composition of the materials down to the atomic level on the other side, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects. We propose an improved in situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient.</description>

      <title>Programmable activation of quantum emitters in high-purity silicon with focused carbon ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon implantation at the nanoscale is highly desired for the engineering of defect-based qubits in a variety of materials, including silicon, diamond, SiC and hBN. However, the lack of focused carbon ion beams does not allow for the full disclosure of their potential for application in quantum technologies. Here, we develop and use a carbon source for focused ion beams for the simultaneous creation of two types of quantum emitters in silicon, the W and G centers. Furthermore, we apply a multi-step implantation protocol for the programmable activation of the G centers with sub-100- nm resolution. This approach provides a route for significant enhancement of the creation yield of single G centers in carbon-free silicon wafers. Our experimental demonstration is an important step towards nanoscale engineering of telecom quantum emitters in silicon of high crystalline quality and isotope purity.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for charge transport in GNRs through particle Galerkin methods for the semiclassical Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some issues related to the quantification of uncertainties associated with the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons. The approach is suited to understand the effects of missing information linked to the difficulty of fixing some material parameters, such as the band gap, and the strength of the applied electric field. In particular, we focus on the extension of particle Galerkin methods for kinetic equations in the case of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for charge transport in graphene nanoribbons with uncertainties. To this end, we develop an efficient particle scheme which allows us to parallelize the computation and then, after a suitable generalization of the scheme to the case of random inputs, we present a Galerkin reformulation of the particle dynamics, obtained by means of a generalized polynomial chaos approach, which allows the reconstruction of the kinetic distribution. As a consequence, the proposed particle-based scheme preserves the physical properties and the positivity of the distribution function also in the presence of a complex scattering in the transport equation of electrons. The impact of the uncertainty of the band gap and applied field on the electrical current is analyzed.</description>

      <title>High-throughput discovery of metal oxides with high thermoelectric performance via interpretable feature engineering on small data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19613</link>

Abstract: In this work, we have proposed a data-driven screening framework combining the interpretable machine learning with high-throughput calculations to identify a series of metal oxides that exhibit both high-temperature tolerance and high power factors. Aiming at the problem of weak generalization ability of small data with power factors at high temperatures, we employ symbolic regression for feature creation which enhances the robustness of the model while preserving the physical meaning of features. 33 candidate metal oxides are finally targeted for high-temperature thermoelectric applications from a pool of 48,694 compounds in the Materials Project database. The Boltzmann transport theory is utilized to perform electrical transport properties calculations at 1,000 K. The relaxation time is approximated by employing constant electron-phonon coupling based on the deformation potential theory. Considering band degeneracy, the electron group velocity is obtained using the momentum matrix element method, yielding 28 materials with power factors greater than 50 ${\mu}W cm^{-1} K^{-2} $. The high-throughput framework we proposed is instrumental in the selection of metal oxides for high-temperature thermoelectric applications. Furthermore, our data-driven analysis and transport calculation suggest that metal oxides rich in elements such as cerium (Ce), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb) tend to exhibit high power factors at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>RCS reduction method with anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis : design modelling and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. This work focuses the discussion on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the Floquet direction considered. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <title>Experimental set-up for thermal measurements at the nanoscale using an SThM probe with niobium nitride thermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has become an important measurement tool for characterizing the thermal properties of materials at the nanometer scale. This technique requires a SThM probe that combines an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probe and a very sensitive resistive thermometry; the thermometer being located at the apex of the probe tip allows the mapping of temperature or thermal properties of nanostructured materials with very high spatial resolution. The high interest of the SThM technique in the field of thermal nanoscience currently suffers from a low temperature sensitivity despite its high spatial resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a high vacuum-based AFM system hosting a highly sensitive niobium nitride (NbN) SThM probe to demonstrate its unique performance. As a proof of concept, we utilized this custom-built system to carry out thermal measurements using the 3$\omega$ method. By measuring the $V_{3\omega}$ voltage on the NbN resistive thermometer in vacuum conditions we were able to determine the SThM probe's thermal conductance and thermal time constant. The performance of the probe is demonstrated by doing thermal measurements in-contact with a sapphire sample.</description>
