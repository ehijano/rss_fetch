      <title>RSstitcher - Seamless merging 2D diffraction frames for Wide Range Reciprocal Space Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide Range Reciprocal Space Mapping (WR-RSM) is a technique that allows visualisation of the geometric relationships among multiple hkl spots in a single reciprocal space map. However, current commercial software for reconstructing WR-RSM data suffers from several limitations, hindering its promotion. Here, we develop an open-source python program, named RSstitcher (Reciprocal Space Stitcher), to merge 2D diffraction frames measured at different cradle tilt angles into WR-RSMs, allowing the technique to be implemented on any laboratory X-ray diffractometer equipped with a goniometer cradle and a 2D detector. The conversion equations used in the python program is explained geometrically, including novel WR-RSM measurements in {\omega}-{\phi} compensated Side Inclination Grazing Incident Diffraction geometry for thin film samples. We demonstrate its application using two major 2D X-ray diffraction systems on the market, which generated similar WR-RSM results for bulk and thin film samples.</description>

      <title>Design and Expected Performance for an hKLM at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent time resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design, and the highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for more complex detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system at the EIC as well as provide for the identification and momentum measurement of neutral hadrons. At the EIC, these are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\% are achieved using time-of-flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than has been demonstrated for similar calorimeters that are read out with less granularity.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic source of atomic tritium for precision spectroscopy and neutrino-mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a concept for a cryogenic source of atomic tritium at sub-kelvin temperatures and energies suitable for magnetic trapping. The source is based on the dissociation of solid molecular tritium films below 1 K by electrons from a pulsed RF discharge, a technique recently demonstrated for atomic hydrogen, combined with buffer-gas cooling and magnetic confinement. We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Differential fuzz testing to detect tampering in sensor systems and its application to arms control authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In future nuclear arms control treaties, it will be necessary to authenticate the hardware and software components of verification measurement systems, i.e., to ensure these systems are functioning as intended and have not been tampered with by malicious actors. While methods such as source code hashing and static analysis can help verify the integrity of software components, they may not be capable of detecting tampering with environment variables, external libraries, or the firmware and hardware of radiation measurement systems. In this article, we introduce the concept of physical differential fuzz testing as a challenge-response-style tamper indicator that can holistically and simultaneously test all the above components in a cyber-physical system. In essence, we randomly sample (or "fuzz") the untampered system's parameter space, including both normal and off-normal parameter values, and consider the time series of outputs as the baseline signature of the system. Re-running the same input sequence on a untampered system will produce an output sequence consistent with this baseline, while running the same input sequence on a tampered system will produce a modified output sequence and raise an alarm. We then apply this concept to authenticating the radiation measurement equipment in nuclear weapon verification systems and conduct demonstration fuzz testing measurements with a sodium iodide (NaI) gamma ray spectrometer. Because there is Poisson noise in the measured output spectra, we also use a mechanism for comparing inherently noisy or stochastic fuzzing sequences. We show that physical differential fuzz testing can detect two types of tamper attempts, and conclude that it is a promising framework for authenticating future cyber-physical systems in nuclear arms control, safeguards, and beyond.</description>

      <title>A prototype reactor-antineutrino detector based on $^6$Li-doped pulse-shaping-discriminating plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An aboveground 60-kg reactor-antineutrino detector prototype, comprised of a 2-dimensional array of 36 $^{6}$Li-doped pulse shape sensitive plastic scintillator bars, is described. Each bar is 50~cm long with a square cross section of 5.5~cm. Doped with $^{6}$Li at 0.1\% by mass, the detector is capable of identifying correlated energy depositions for the detection of reactor antineutrinos via the inverse-beta-decay reaction. Each bar is wrapped with a specular reflector that directs photons towards PMTs mounted at both ends of the bar. This paper highlights the construction, key features, and main performance characteristics of the system. The system, which relies on multiple observables such as PSD, energy, position, and timing, is capable of detecting IBD-like neutron-correlated backgrounds, long-lived decay chains, and cosmogenic isotopes.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Sub-Percent Energy Resolution in the NEXT-100 Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NEXT-100 is a high-pressure xenon time projection chamber with electroluminescent amplification, designed to operate with up to approximately 70.5 kg at 13.5 bar. It is the most recent detector developed by the NEXT collaboration to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay ($\beta\beta 0\nu$) of Xe-136. The NEXT gas TPC technology offers the best energy resolution near the Q-value of the decay ($Q_{\beta\beta}$ = 2458 keV) among xenon detectors, which is set by design to be &lt;1% FWHM. We report here the high-energy calibration of the detector using a Th-228 source, demonstrating linear response and an energy resolution of $(0.90 \pm 0.02)$% FWHM at the Tl-208 photopeak (2615 keV). This performance extrapolates to a resolution at the double-beta decay end-point of $R(Q_{\beta\beta})$ = $(0.93 \pm 0.02)$% FWHM, confirming the detector's capability for precision energy measurement in the search for $\beta\beta 0\nu$.</description>

      <title>Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si$_3$N$_4$-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Tunable Synthetic Wavelength Ranging with an RFSoC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of optical range and time-of-flight are crucial for a variety of high-precision technologies. Competitive optical measurement techniques have been developed that balance precision with accuracy and system complexity. Here, we present a continuous-wave synthetic wavelength interferometry technique that employs digitally tunable electro-optic frequency combs. With a software-defined radio, our approach can dynamically sweep the synthetic wavelength and measure absolute optical range. We demonstrate this digital approach over a free-space optical delay line of 1 m and over an 40 km fiber link. The best obtained precision over the delay line is better than 60 nm (0.2 fs). Through a 40 km fiber spool, this precision degrades to 15 um (50 fs), which is a fractional error on the order of 2e-10 m/m. Our design is simple to implement, and only relies on continuous-wave interference, decreasing system complexity.</description>
