      <title>Macroscopic dynamics of oscillator ensembles with communities, higher-order interactions, and phase lags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of phase-frustrated, higher-order interactions in a system of coupled phase oscillators with two communities. We use dimensionality reduction techniques to derive a low-dimensional system of ODEs to describe the macroscopic behavior of the system. By analyzing this system we show that, in addition to the fixed point solutions present in a system of oscillators with higher order interactions and community structure only, the system also exhibits oscillatory or chaotic synchronization behavior for some phase lag values. Moreover, some phase lag values give rise to multistability of solutions, where both fixed point solutions and oscillatory or chaotic behavior of the order parameters can be observed, depending on initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity is modeled by a family of dynamical systems on two-dimensional torus: the so-called RSJ model. As was discovered by V.M.Buchstaber and S.I.Tertychnyi, this family admits an equivalent description by a family of second order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The {\it phase-lock areas} of a family of dynamical systems on torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have non-empty interiors. For the RSJ model, V.M.Buchstaber, O.V.Karpov and S.I.~Tertychnyi discovered the Rotation Number Quantization Effect: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. As was shown by A.V.~Klimenko and O.L.~Romaskevich, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie in the abscissa axis are called {\it constrictions}. In the present paper we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The Quantization Effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>

      <title>Emerging properties of the degree distribution in large non-growing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree distribution is a key statistical indicator in network theory, often used to understand how information spreads across connected nodes. In this paper, we focus on non-growing networks formed through a rewiring algorithm and develop kinetic Boltzmann-type models to capture the emergence of degree distributions that characterize both preferential attachment networks and random networks. Under a suitable mean-field scaling, these models reduce to a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation with an affine diffusion coefficient, that is consistent with a well-established master equation for discrete rewiring processes. We further analyze the convergence to equilibrium for this class of Fokker-Planck equations, demonstrating how different regimes -- ranging from exponential to algebraic rates -- depend on network parameters. Our results provide a unified framework for modeling degree distributions in non-growing networks and offer insights into the long-time behavior of such systems.</description>

      <title>Noise equals control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>
