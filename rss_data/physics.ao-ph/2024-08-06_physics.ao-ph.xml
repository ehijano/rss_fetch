      <title>Huge Ensembles Part II: Properties of a Huge Ensemble of Hindcasts Generated with Spherical Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Part I, we created an ensemble based on Spherical Fourier Neural Operators. As initial condition perturbations, we used bred vectors, and as model perturbations, we used multiple checkpoints trained independently from scratch. Based on diagnostics that assess the ensemble's physical fidelity, our ensemble has comparable performance to operational weather forecasting systems. However, it requires several orders of magnitude fewer computational resources. Here in Part II, we generate a huge ensemble (HENS), with 7,424 members initialized each day of summer 2023. We enumerate the technical requirements for running huge ensembles at this scale. HENS precisely samples the tails of the forecast distribution and presents a detailed sampling of internal variability. For extreme climate statistics, HENS samples events 4$\sigma$ away from the ensemble mean. At each grid cell, HENS improves the skill of the most accurate ensemble member and enhances coverage of possible future trajectories. As a weather forecasting model, HENS issues extreme weather forecasts with better uncertainty quantification. It also reduces the probability of outlier events, in which the verification value lies outside the ensemble forecast distribution.</description>

      <title>Taming Uncertainty in a Complex World: The Rise of Uncertainty Quantification -- A Tutorial for Beginners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial about uncertainty quantification (UQ) for those who have no background but are interested in learning more in this area. It exploits many very simple examples, which are understandable to undergraduates, to present the ideas of UQ. Topics include characterizing uncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and UQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each topic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both Matlab and Python codes are made available for these simple examples.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01829v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling atmospheric chemistry is complex and computationally intense. Given the recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we propose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We consider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential Equation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future time evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator (NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To efficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time embedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we use the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient computation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the training optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical dataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Distilling Machine Learning's Added Value: Pareto Fronts in Atmospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the added value of machine learning (ML) for weather and climate applications is measurable, explaining it remains challenging, especially for large deep learning models. Inspired by climate model hierarchies, we propose that a full hierarchy of Pareto-optimal models, defined within an appropriately determined error-complexity plane, can guide model development and help understand the models' added value. We demonstrate the use of Pareto fronts in atmospheric physics through three sample applications, with hierarchies ranging from semi-empirical models with minimal tunable parameters (simplest) to deep learning algorithms (most complex). First, in cloud cover parameterization, we find that neural networks identify nonlinear relationships between cloud cover and its thermodynamic environment, and assimilate previously neglected features such as vertical gradients in relative humidity that improve the representation of low cloud cover. This added value is condensed into a ten-parameter equation that rivals the performance of deep learning models. Second, we establish a ML model hierarchy for emulating shortwave radiative transfer, distilling the importance of bidirectional vertical connectivity for accurately representing absorption and scattering, especially for multiple cloud layers. Third, we emphasize the importance of convective organization information when modeling the relationship between tropical precipitation and its surrounding environment. We discuss the added value of temporal memory when high-resolution spatial information is unavailable, with implications for precipitation parameterization. Therefore, by comparing data-driven models directly with existing schemes using Pareto optimality, we promote process understanding by hierarchically unveiling system complexity, with the hope of improving the trustworthiness of ML models in atmospheric applications.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised multi-scale diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unsupervised and principled diagnosis of multi-scale data is a fundamental obstacle in modern scientific problems from, for instance, weather and climate prediction, neurology, epidemiology, and turbulence. Multi-scale data is characterized by a combination of processes acting along multiple dimensions simultaneously, spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, non-stationarity, and/or invariances such as translation and rotation. Existing methods are not well-suited to multi-scale data, usually requiring supervised strategies such as human intervention, extensive tuning, or selection of ideal time periods. We present the multi-resolution Coherent Spatio-Temporal Scale Separation (mrCOSTS), a hierarchical and automated algorithm for the diagnosis of coherent patterns or modes in multi-scale data. mrCOSTS is a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition which decomposes data into bands of spatial patterns with shared time dynamics, thereby providing a robust method for analyzing multi-scale data. It requires no training but instead takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of multi-scale systems. We demonstrate mrCOSTS using complex multi-scale data sets that are canonically difficult to analyze: 1) climate patterns of sea surface temperature, 2) electrophysiological observations of neural signals of the motor cortex, and 3) horizontal wind in the mountain boundary layer. With mrCOSTS, we trivially retrieve complex dynamics that were previously difficult to resolve while additionally extracting hitherto unknown patterns of activity embedded in the dynamics, allowing for advancing the understanding of these fields of study. This method is an important advancement for addressing the multi-scale data which characterize many of the grand challenges in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B\'enard convective motion of stratified fluids in the Earth's troposphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kaladze and Misra [Phys. Scr. 99 (2024) 085013] showed that the tropospheric stratified fluid flows may be unstable by the effects of the negative temperature gradient and the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity arising from the thermal expansion. They also predicted that the modification in the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency by the density inhomogeneity can lead to Rayleigh-B\'enard convective instability in the tropospheric unbounded layers. The purpose of the present work is to revisit the Rayleigh-B\'enard convective instability in more detail by considering both unbounded and bounded tropospheric layers. We show that the conditions for instability in these two cases significantly differ. The critical values of the Raleigh numbers and the expressions for the instability growth rates of thermal waves in the two cases are obtained and analyzed. In the case of the bounded region, we also derive the necessary boundary conditions and note that the vertical wave number is quantified, and the corresponding eigenvalue problem is well-set.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal theory of instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>
