      <title>IceCube Search for Neutrino Emission from X-ray Bright Seyfert Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent IceCube detection of TeV neutrino emission from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could make a sizable contribution to the diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos. The absence of TeV $\gamma$-rays from NGC 1068 indicates neutrino production in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole, where the high radiation density leads to $\gamma$-ray attenuation. Therefore, any potential neutrino emission from similar sources is not expected to correlate with high-energy $\gamma$-rays. Disk-corona models predict neutrino emission from Seyfert galaxies to correlate with keV X-rays, as they are tracers of coronal activity. Using through-going track events from the Northern Sky recorded by IceCube between 2011 and 2021, we report results from a search for individual and aggregated neutrino signals from 27 additional Seyfert galaxies that are contained in the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). Besides the generic single power-law, we evaluate the spectra predicted by the disk-corona model. Assuming all sources to be intrinsically similar to NGC 1068, our findings constrain the collective neutrino emission from X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies in the Northern Hemisphere, but, at the same time, show excesses of neutrinos that could be associated with the objects NGC 4151 and CGCG 420-015. These excesses result in a 2.7$\sigma$ significance with respect to background expectations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Wind-Driven Accretion Onto Gaia BH3 With Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the most massive known stellar-origin black hole, with a mass $M_\bullet \approx 33 M_\odot$. Detected from Gaia's astrometry, this black hole resembles those observed via gravitational waves, whose nature is still highly debated. Hosted in a binary system with a companion giant star that is too far away for Roche-lobe mass transfer, this black hole could nonetheless accrete at low levels due to wind-driven mass-loss from its companion star, thus accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow, or ADAF, mode. Using stellar models, we constrain its Eddington ratio in the range $10^{-9} &lt; f_{\rm Edd} &lt; 10^{-7}$, corresponding to radiative efficiencies $5\times10^{-5} &lt; \epsilon &lt; 10^{-3}$, compatible with radiatively inefficient accretion modes. Chandra ACIS-S observed this object and obtained the most sensitive upper bound of its [2-10] keV flux: $F_X &lt; 3.25 \times 10^{-15} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}$ at $90\%$ confidence level corresponding to $L_{[2-10]}&lt; 2.10 \times 10^{29} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$. Using ADAF emission models, we constrained its accretion rate to $f_{\rm Edd}&lt; 4.91 \times 10^{-7}$ at the apastron, in agreement with our theoretical estimate. At the periastron, we expect fluxes $\sim 50$ times larger. Hence, accretion did not significantly contribute to black hole growth over the system's lifetime. Detecting the electromagnetic emission from Gaia BH3 will be fundamental to informing stellar wind and accretion disk models.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytical Fokker Planck Models for Nuclear Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, the dense stellar environments surrounding massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. We consider angular momentum diffusion due to two-body scatterings among stellar objects and energy advection due to gravitational wave emission upon interaction with the central massive black hole. Such dynamics is described by a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in energy-angular momentum space. Focusing on the transition between the diffusion-dominated region and the advection-dominated one, we utilize self-similarity to obtain a full solution for the Fokker-Planck equation. This solution provides the density and flux of the stellar objects in nuclear star clusters. This improves the rate estimates for extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and has interesting implications for a new class of galactic center transients called quasi-periodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>A gamma-ray flare from TXS 1508+572: characterizing the jet of a $z=4.31$ blazar in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars can be detected from very large distances due to their high luminosity. However, the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars beyond $z=3$ has only been confirmed for a small number of sources. Such observations probe the growth of supermassive black holes close to the peak of star formation in the history of galaxy evolution. As a result from a continuous monitoring of a sample of 80 $z&gt;3$ blazars with Fermi-LAT, we present the first detection of a $\gamma$-ray flare from the $z=4.31$ blazar TXS 1508+572. This source showed high $\gamma$-ray activity from February to August 2022, reaching a peak luminosity comparable to the most luminous flares ever detected with Fermi -LAT. We conducted a multiwavelength observing campaign involving XMM-Newton, Swift, the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array. In addition, we make use of the monitoring programs by the Zwicky Transient Facility and NEOWISE at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. We find that the source is particularly variable in the infrared band on daily time scales. The spectral energy distribution collected during our campaign is well described by a one-zone leptonic model, with the $\gamma$-ray flare originating from an increase of external Compton emission as a result of a fresh injection of accelerated electrons.</description>

      <title>Probing the Shock Breakout Signal of SN 2024ggi from the Transformation of Early Flash Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN\,2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim\,4\,\times\,10^{14}$\,cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times\, 10^{-3}$\,\Msun\,yr$^{-1}$\,is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 \kms, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Interaction of an outflow with surrounding gaseous clouds as the origin of the late-time radio flares in TDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of $10^{38\sim39}$ erg/s. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circum-nuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow-diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2$\sim0.8$ c, the total mass of $10^{-3}\sim10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are $0.1\sim1$ pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.</description>

      <title>The Very High Energy Afterglow of Structured Jets: GW 170817 and Prospects for Future Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete numerical model of the afterglow of a laterally-structured relativistic ejecta from radio to very high energy (VHE). This includes a self-consistent calculation of the synchrotron radiation, with its maximum frequency, and of Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) scatterings taking into account the Klein-Nishina regime. The attenuation due to pair production is also included. This model is computationally-efficient, allowing for multi-wavelength data fitting. As a validation test, the radiative model is used to fit the broad-band spectrum of GRB 190114C at 90 s up to the TeV range. The full model is then used to fit the afterglow of GW 170817 and predict its VHE emission. We find that the SSC flux at the peak was much dimmer than the upper limit from H.E.S.S. observations. However, we show that either a smaller viewing angle or a larger external density would make similar off-axis events detectable in the future at VHE, even above 100 Mpc with the sensitivity of the CTA. Large external densities are expected in the case of fast mergers, but the existence of a formation channel for such binary neutron stars is still uncertain. We highlight that VHE afterglow detections would help probing efficiently such systems.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the radio calibrator and gamma-ray emitting NLS1 galaxy 3C 286 and its multiwavelength variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasar 3C 286, a well-known calibrator source in radio astronomy, was found to exhibit exceptional multiwavelength properties. Its rich and complex optical emission-line spectrum revealed its narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) nature. Given its strong radio emission, this makes 3C 286 one of the radio-loudest NLS1 galaxies known to date. 3C 286 is also one of very few known compact steep-spectrum (CSS) sources detected in the gamma-ray regime. Observations in the X-ray regime, rarely carried out so far, revealed evidence for variability, raising the question if driven by the accretion disk or jet. 3C 286 is also well known for its damped Lyman alpha system from an intervening absorber at z = 0.692, triggering a search for the corresponding X-ray absorption along the line-of-sight. Here, we present new observations in the radio, X-ray, optical and UV band. The nature of the X-ray variability is addressed. Spectral evidence suggests that it is primarily driven by the accretion disk (not the jet), and the X-ray spectrum is well fit by a powerlaw plus soft excess model. The radio flux density and polarization remain constant at the Effelsberg telescope resolution, reconfirming the use of 3C 286 as radio calibrator. The amount of reddening/absorption along the line-of-sight {\em{intrinsic}} to 3C 286 is rigorously assessed. None is found, validating the derivation of a high Eddington ratio (L/L-Edd ~ 1) and of the very high radio-loudness index of 3C 286. Based on the first deep Chandra image of 3C 286, tentative evidence for hard X-ray emission from the SW radio lobe is reported. A large variety of models for the gamma-ray emission of 3C 286 is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>An Untargeted Search for Radio-Emitting Tidal Disruption Events in the VAST Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2$\sigma$ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ~6 to 230 days and ~10$^{38}$ to 10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets. After calculating the detection efficiency of our search using a Monte Carlo simulation of TDEs, and assuming all 12 sources are jetted TDEs, we derive a volumetric rate for jetted TDEs of 0.80$^{+0.31}_{-0.23}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous empirically estimated rates.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Phase Transition in the xSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}&gt; 10^{-300}$. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PBHs within the xSM framework may align with observations of the six ultrashort timescale events reported by the OGLE microlensing experiment.</description>

      <title>Implications for Galactic Electron Density Structure from Pulsar Sightlines Intersecting HII Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent radio surveys have revealed pulsars with dispersion and scattering delays induced by ionized gas that are larger than the rest of the observed pulsar population, in some cases with electron column densities (or dispersion measures; DMs) larger than the maximum predictions of Galactic electron density models. By cross-matching the observed pulsar population against HII region catalogs, we show that the majority of pulsars with $\rm DM &gt; 600$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and scattering delays $\tau(1\ {\rm GHz}) &gt; 10$ ms lie behind HII regions, and that HII region intersections may be relevant to as much as a third of the observed pulsar population. Accounting for HII regions resolves apparent discrepancies where Galactic electron density models place high-DM pulsars beyond the Galactic disk. By comparing emission measures (EMs) inferred from recombination line observations to pulsar DMs, we show that HII regions can contribute tens to hundreds of pc cm$^{-3}$ in electron column density along a pulsar LOS. We find that nearly all pulsars with significant excess (and deficit) scattering from the mean $\tau$-DM relation are spatially coincident with known discrete ionized gas structures, including HII regions. Accounting for HII regions is critical to the interpretation of radio dispersion and scattering measurements as electron density tracers, both in the Milky Way and in other galaxies.</description>

      <title>Tests of general relativity at the fourth post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently computed post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational-wave phasing up to 4.5PN order accounts for several novel physical effects in compact binary dynamics such as the {\it tail of the memory, tails of tails of tails and tails of mass hexadecupole and current octupole moments}. Therefore, it is instructive to assess the ability of current-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO/Virgo, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope and space-based detectors like LISA to test the predictions of PN theory at these orders. Employing Fisher information matrix, we find that the projected bounds on the deviations from the logarithmic PN phasing coefficient at 4PN is ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-1})$ for XG and 2G detectors, respectively. Similarly, the projected bounds on other three PN coefficients that appear at 4PN and 4.5PN are ${\cal O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$ for XG and ${\cal O}(1)$ for 2G detectors. LISA observations of supermassive BHs could provide the tightest constraints on these four parameters ranging from ${\cal O}(10^{-4}-10^{-2})$. The variation in these bounds are studied as a function of total mass and the mass ratio of the binaries in quasi-circular orbits. These new tests are unique probes of higher order nonlinear interactions in compact binary dynamics and their consistency with the predictions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>The Camera and Readout for the Trinity Demonstrator and the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a modular silicon photomultiplier camera to detect Earth-skimming PeV to EeV tau neutrinos with the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique. We built two cameras, a 256-pixel camera with S14161-6050HS SiPMs for the Trinity Demonstrator located on Frisco Peak, Utah, and a 512-pixel camera with S14521-6050AN SiPMs for the EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope. The front-end electronics are based on the eMUSIC ASIC, and the camera signals are sampled and digitized with the 100MS/s and 12-bit AGET system. Both cameras are liquid-cooled. We detail the camera concept and the results from characterizing the SiPMs, bench testing, and calibrating the two cameras.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowsian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

      <title>Space-based Gravitational Wave Observatories Will Be Able to Use Eccentricity to Unveil Stellar-mass Binary Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of eccentricity would provide strong constraints on the formation channel of stellar-mass binary black holes. However, current ground-based gravitational wave detectors will, in most cases, not be able to measure eccentricity due to orbital circularization. Space-based observatories, in contrast, can determine binary eccentricity at 0.01Hz to $e_{0.01}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}) $. Directly observing stellar-mass binary black holes with space-based observatories remains a challenging problem. However, observing such systems with ground-based detectors allows the possibility to identify the same signal in archival data from space-based observatories in the years previous. Since ground-based detectors provide little constraints on eccentricity, including eccentricity in the archival search will increase the required number of filter waveforms for the archival search by 5 orders of magnitudes [from $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3)$ to $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^8)$], and will correspondingly need $ \sim8\times10^5 $ core hours (and $ \sim 10^5$ GB of memory), even for a mild upper limit on eccentricity of $0.1$. In this work, we have constructed the first template bank for an archival search of space-based gravitational wave detectors, including eccentricity. We have demonstrated that even though the inclusion of eccentricity brings extra computational burden, an archival search including eccentricity will be feasible in the time frame of planned space-based observatories, and will provide strong constraints on the eccentricities of stellar-mass binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-gamma-ray emission at low-luminosity from CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 and its Host SNR G296.5+10.0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanisms of energetic particles in the universe remain enigmatic in contemporary astrophysics. Recent efforts have focused on identifying Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV, known as PeVatrons, and also identifying sources contributing to the spectrum at lower energies. The different morphology of galactic supernova remnants is directly related to the type of stellar explosion and the existence of a possible Compact Central Object (CCO), which possess intense radiativegravitational fields on their surfaces. These CCOs, due to their strong fields and interactions with surrounding magnetic clouds, are potential candidates for cosmic ray production. Through observations of the compact X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the remnant G296.5+10.0, and using the enhanced GALPROP code, we analyze the emission of gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray acceleration and propagation. Additionally, we calculate the contribution of this association to the overall observed Galactic cosmic-ray flux, considering cosmic-ray propagation within the Galaxy, including energy losses and particle interactions. Our findings suggest that this setup offers a fertile environment for producing a wide range of cosmic-ray energies at low energy within the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the Galactic Center Excess Morphology Against Masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains an enduring mystery, with leading explanations being annihilating dark matter or an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars. Analyzing the morphology of the GCE provides critical clues to identify its exact origin. We investigate the robustness of the inferred GCE morphology against the effects of masking, an important step in the analysis where the gamma-ray emission from point sources and the galactic disk are excluded. Using different masks constructed from Fermi point source catalogs and a wavelet method, we find that the GCE morphology, particularly its ellipticity and cuspiness, is relatively independent of the choice of mask for energies above 2-3 GeV. The GCE morphology systematically favors an approximately spherical shape, as expected for dark matter annihilation. Compared to various stellar bulge profiles, a spherical dark matter annihilation profile better fits the data across different masks and galactic diffuse emission backgrounds, except for the stellar bulge profile from Coleman et al. (2020), which provides a similar fit to the data. Modeling the GCE with two components, one from dark matter annihilation and one tracing the Coleman Bulge, we find this two-component model outperforms any single component or combinations of dark matter annihilation and other stellar bulge profiles. Uncertainty remains about the exact fraction contributed by each component across different background models and masks. However, when the Coleman Bulge dominates, its corresponding spectrum lacks characteristics typically associated with millisecond pulsars, suggesting that it mostly models the emission from other sources instead of the GCE that is still present and spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruptions of spinning eccentric white dwarfs by spinning intermediate mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs, $\sim 10^2-10^5M_{\odot}$) are often dubbed as the missing link between stellar mass ($\lesssim 10^2M_{\odot}$) and super-massive ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} M_{\odot}$) black holes. Observational signatures of these can result from tidal disruptions of white dwarfs (WDs), which would otherwise be captured as a whole by super-massive black holes. Recent observations indicate that IMBHs might be rapidly spinning, while it is also known that isolated white dwarfs might have large spins, with spin periods of the order of minutes. Here, we aim to understand the effects of ``coupling'' between black hole and stellar spin, focussing on the tidal disruption of spinning WDs in the background of spinning IMBHs. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we perform a suite of numerical simulations of partial tidal disruptions, where spinning WDs are in eccentric orbits about spinning IMBHs. We take a hybrid approach, where we integrate the Kerr geodesic equations while being in a regime where we can treat the internal stellar fluid dynamics in the Newtonian limit. We observe strong dependence of quantities like the core mass and the mass differences between tidal tails on such coupled spin effects. However, observable quantities such as mass fallback rates and gravitational wave amplitudes show minimal variations with these, in the parameter range that we consider.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the propagation of ultraheavy (UH) nuclei as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We show that their energy loss lengths at $\lesssim300$~EeV are significantly longer than those of protons and intermediate-mass nuclei, and that the highest-energy cosmic rays with energies beyond $\sim100$ EeV, including the Amaterasu particle, may originate from such UH-UHECRs. We derive constraints on the contribution of UH-UHECR sources, and find that they are consistent with energy generation rate densities of UHECRs from collapsars and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ringdown signal of black holes formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers. We analyze data from $47$ numerical relativity simulations. We show that the $(\ell=2,m=2)$ and $(\ell=2,m=1)$ multipoles of the gravitational wave signal are well fitted by decaying damped exponentials, as predicted by black-hole perturbation theory. We show that the ratio of the amplitude in the two modes depends on the progenitor binary mass ratio $q$ and reduced tidal parameter $\tilde\Lambda$. Unfortunately, the numerical uncertainty in our data is too large to fully quantify this dependency. If confirmed, these results will enable novel tests of general relativity in the presence of matter with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars exhibit the vacuum non-linear electrodynamics effects, which can be well described using the one-loop effective action for quantum electrodynamics. In this context, we study the propagation and polarization of pulsar radio emission, based on the post-Maxwellian Lagrangian from the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger action. Given the refractive index obtained from this Lagrangian, we determine the leading-order corrections to both the propagation and polarization vectors due to quantum refraction via perturbation analysis. In addition, the effects on the orthogonality between the propagation and polarization vectors and the Faraday rotation angle, all due to quantum refraction are investigated. Furthermore, from the dual refractive index and the associated polarization modes, we discuss quantum birefringence, with the optical phenomenology analogous to its classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Striking the right tone: toward a self-consistent framework for measuring black hole ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ringdown portion of a binary black hole merger consists of a sum of modes, each containing an infinite number of tones that are exponentially damped sinusoids. In principle, these can be measured as gravitational-waves with observatories like LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, however in practice it is unclear how many tones can be meaningfully resolved. We investigate the consistency and resolvability of the overtones of the quadrupolar $\ell = m = 2$ mode by starting at late times when the gravitational waveform is expected to be well-approximated by the $\ell m n = 220$ tone alone. We present a Bayesian inference framework to measure the tones in numerical relativity data. We measure tones at different start times, checking for consistency: we classify a tone as stably recovered if and only if the 95\% credible intervals for amplitude and phase at time $t$ overlap with the credible intervals at all subsequent times. We test a set of tones including the first four overtones of the fundamental mode and the 320 tone and find that the 220 and 221 tones can be measured consistently with the inclusion of additional overtones. The 222 tone measurements can be stabilised when we include the 223 tone, but only in a narrow time window, after which it is too weak to measure. The 223 tone recovery appears to be unstable, and does not become stable with the introduction of the 224 tone. We find that $N=3$ tones can be stably recovered simultaneously. However, when analysing $N \geq 4$ tones, the amplitude of one tone is consistent with zero. Thus, within our framework, one can identify only $N=3$ tones with non-zero amplitude that are simultaneously stable.</description>
