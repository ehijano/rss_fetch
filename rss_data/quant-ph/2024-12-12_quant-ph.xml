      <title>Characterizing the Yang-Lee zeros of the classical Ising model through the dynamic quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, the Loschmidt amplitude is analogous to the partition function in the canonical ensemble. Zeros in the partition function indicates a phase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude indicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.</description>

      <title>Pattern Tree: Enhancing Efficiency in Quantum Circuit Optimization Based on Pattern-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit optimization is essential for improving the performance of quantum algorithms, particularly on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices with limited qubit connectivity and high error rates. Pattern matching has proven to be an effective technique for identifying and optimizing subcircuits by replacing them with functionally equivalent, efficient versions, including reducing circuit depth and facilitating platform portability. However, existing approaches face challenges in handling large-scale circuits and numerous transformation rules, often leading to redundant matches and increased compilation time. In this study, we propose a novel framework for quantum circuit optimization based on pattern matching to enhance its efficiency. Observing redundancy in applying existing transformation rules, our method employs a pattern tree structure to organize these rules, reducing redundant operations during the execution of the pattern-matching algorithm and improving matching efficiency. We design and implement a compilation framework to demonstrate the practicality of the pattern tree approach. Experimental results show that pattern-tree-based pattern matching can reduce execution time by an average of 20% on a well-accepted benchmark set. Furthermore, we analyze how to build a pattern tree to maximize the optimization of compilation time. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach has the potential to optimize compilation time by 90%.</description>

      <title>Boundary transitions from a single round of measurements on gapless quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements can qualitatively alter correlations and entanglement emerging in gapless quantum matter. We show how a single round of measurements on gapless quantum systems can, upon rotating the measurement basis, induce non-trivial transitions separating regimes displaying universal characteristics governed by distinct boundary conformal field theories. We develop the theory of such `measurement-induced boundary transitions' by investigating a gapless parent of the one-dimensional cluster state, obtained by appropriately symmetrizing a commuting projector Hamiltonian for the latter. Projective measurements on the cluster state are known to convert the wavefunction, after post-selection or decoding, into a long-range-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Similar measurements applied to the gapless parent (i) generate long-range order coexisting with power-law correlations when post-selecting for uniform outcomes, and (ii) yield power-law correlations distinct from those in the pre-measurement state upon decoding. In the post-selection scenario, rotating the measurement basis preserves long-range order up until a critical tilt angle marking a measurement-induced boundary transition to a power-law-ordered regime. Such a transition -- which does not exist in the descendant cluster state -- establishes new connections between measurement effects on many-body states and non-trivial renormalization-group flows. We extend our analysis to tricritical Ising and three-state Potts critical theories, which also display measurement-induced boundary transitions, and propose general criteria for their existence in other settings.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) explains how generic quantum many-body systems thermalize internally. It implies that local operators' time-averaged expectation values approximately equal their thermal expectation values, regardless of microscopic details. The ETH's range of applicability therefore impacts theory and experiments. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ recently showed that non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH. Such symmetries have excited interest in quantum thermodynamics lately, as they are equivalent to conserved quantities that fail to commute with each other and noncommutation is a quintessentially quantum phenomenon. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ proposed a non-Abelian ETH, which we support numerically. The numerics model a one-dimensional (1D) next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain of up to 18 qubits. We represent local operators with matrices relative to an energy eigenbasis. The matrices bear out seven predictions of the non-Abelian ETH. We also prove analytically that the non-Abelian ETH exhibits a self-consistency property. The proof relies on a thermodynamic-entropy definition different from that in Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ This work initiates the observation and application of the non-Abelian ETH.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction resilient against Atom Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum error correction protocols for neutral atoms quantum processors in the presence of atom loss. We complement the surface code with loss detection units (LDU) and analyze its performances by means of circuit-level simulations for two distinct protocols -- the standard LDU and a recently proposed teleportation-based LDU --, focussing on the impact of both atom loss and depolarizing noise on the logical error probability. We introduce and employ a new adaptive decoding procedure that leverages the knowledge of loss locations provided by the LDUs, improving logical error probabilities by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to a naive decoder. For the considered error models, our results demonstrate the existence of an error threshold line that depends linearly on the probabilities of atom loss and of depolarizing errors. For zero depolarizing noise, the atom loss threshold is about $2.6\%$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, illustrating their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Transparency, Nonclassicality and Nonreciprocity in Chiral Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine quantum statistical properties of transmission and reflection from a chiral waveguide coupled to qubits for arbitrary input powers. We report on several remarkable features of output fields such as transparency, quantum nonreciprocity and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ values less than unity. In particular, for two qubits detuned antisymmetrically with respect to the central waveguide frequency, we find transparency in forward transmission and in photon numbers for arbitrary values of the input powers provided the phase separation between qubits is an integer multiple of $\pi$. Values of $g^{(2)}(0)$ less than unity can be reached even for nonzero value of the intrinsic damping by using phase separation different from integer multiple of $\pi$, marking the transition from classical to quantum light. We also uncover a new type of quantum criticality that enables complete suppression of forward-propagating amplitude transmission at specific driving powers, giving rise to enhanced nonreciprocal effects in both transmission and quantum fluctuations in amplitudes. Forward propagation amplifies the quantum fluctuations in amplitudes, while backward propagation significantly suppresses them. These findings open new pathways for controlling light-matter interactions in chiral quantum electrodynamics, with potential applications in quantum information and nonreciprocal quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dephasing induced long-ranged entangled pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a dephasing mechanism for generating symmetrically located long-range entangled pairs in a lattice. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping subjected to a local dephasing at the central site. The dephasing-induced dynamics is strongly relaxing under strong symmetries and give rise to unique steady states in different symmetry sectors. Through explicit analytical calculations, we identify the symmetry sectors that support these strongly correlated robust pairs over arbitrarily long distances and provide analytical expressions of the steady-state correlation matrices. This experimentally relevant work promises applications in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum backflow for two identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics introduces the possibility for particles to move in a direction opposite to their momentum -- a counter-intuitive and classically impossible phenomenon known as quantum backflow. The magnitude of this effect is relatively small, making its experimental observation, which has yet to be achieved, particularly challenging. Here, we investigate the influence of quantum statistics on the maximal backflow attainable for two identical particles confined to a ring. Notably, we demonstrate that the fermionic statistics significantly impedes quantum backflow compared to the bosonic statistics. Our findings suggest that any future experimental realization of quantum backflow should prioritize systems involving bosons rather than fermions.</description>

      <title>Predicting Chaotic Systems with Quantum Echo-state Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial neural networks have enabled impressive tasks on classical computers, but they demand significant computational resources. While quantum computing offers potential beyond classical systems, the advantages of quantum neural networks (QNNs) remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present and examine a quantum circuit (QC) that implements and aims to improve upon the classical echo-state network (ESN), a type of reservoir-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs), using quantum computers. Typically, ESNs consist of an extremely large reservoir that learns high-dimensional embeddings, enabling prediction of complex system trajectories. Quantum echo-state networks (QESNs) aim to reduce this need for prohibitively large reservoirs by leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum computers, potentially allowing for more efficient and higher performing time-series prediction algorithms. The proposed QESN can be implemented on any digital quantum computer implementing a universal gate set, and does not require any sort of stopping or re-initialization of the circuit, allowing continuous evolution of the quantum state over long time horizons. We conducted simulated QC experiments on the chaotic Lorenz system, both with noisy and noiseless models, to demonstrate the circuit's performance and its potential for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.</description>

      <title>Mitigating exponential concentration in covariant quantum kernels for subspace and real-world data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity quantum kernels have shown promise in classification tasks, particularly when a group structure in the data can be identified and exploited through a covariant feature map. In fact, there exist classification problems on which covariant kernels provide a provable advantage, thus establishing a separation between quantum and classical learners. However, their practical application poses two challenges: on one side, the group structure may be unknown and approximate in real-world data, and on the other side, scaling to the `utility' regime (above 100 qubits) is affected by exponential concentration. In this work, we address said challenges by applying fidelity kernels to real-world data with unknown structure, related to the scheduling of a fleet of electric vehicles, and to synthetic data generated from the union of subspaces, which is then close to many relevant real-world datasets. Furthermore, we propose a novel error mitigation strategy specifically tailored for fidelity kernels, called Bit Flip Tolerance (BFT), to alleviate the exponential concentration in our utility-scale experiments. Our multiclass classification reaches accuracies comparable to classical SVCs up to 156 qubits, thus constituting the largest experimental demonstration of quantum machine learning on IBM devices to date. For the real-world data experiments, the effect of the proposed BFT becomes manifest on 40+ qubits, where mitigated accuracies reach 80%, in line with classical, compared to 33% without BFT. Through the union-of-subspace synthetic dataset with 156 qubits, we demonstrate a mitigated accuracy of 80%, compared to 83% of classical models, and 37% of unmitigated quantum, using a test set of limited size.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing in Corrosion Modeling: Bridging Research and Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrosion presents a major challenge to the longevity and reliability of products across various industries, particularly in the aerospace sector. Corrosion arises from chemical processes occurring on an atomistic scale, which lead to macroscopic degradation. Addressing this issue requires multi-scale modeling approaches, which rely on microscopic parameters that are challenging to measure experimentally or model with conventional quantum chemistry techniques.
  In this work, we develop and demonstrate a hybrid quantum-classical workflow tailored for atomistic simulations of corrosion processes, with a specific focus on the initial step of the oxygen reduction reaction -- a critical trigger for the corrosion of aluminum alloys widely used in modern aircraft. Using a combination of classical quantum chemistry methods and quantum computing frameworks, we identify reaction geometries characterized by multi-configurational electronic structures that are ideal for exploring with quantum algorithms.
  For the first time in this context, we explore both noisy intermediate-scale quantum and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for these multi-configurational system, integrating them within a workflow designed to bridge atomistic simulations with macroscopic modeling approaches, such as finite element methods. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed quantum resource estimation to assess when and how quantum computers may play a meaningful role in tackling these problems.
  Our results demonstrate that significant advancements in quantum hardware but also in algorithms and error correction techniques are needed to make quantum computation practically viable for this class of problems. Nevertheless, this work establishes a critical foundation for applying quantum computation to corrosion modeling and highlights its potential to address complex, business-relevant challenges in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum circuits incorporate mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward operations originally intended to realize Quantum Error Correction. This paradigm has recently been utilized to prepare certain states and long-range entangling gates as well as reduce resource overhead in quantum algorithms such as Quantum Fourier Transformation and Quantum Phase Estimation. In this paper, we present a novel framework for generating dynamic quantum circuits that automatically prepare any state or unitary operator. This procedure is powered by numerical optimization-based circuit synthesis methods. The first contribution is introducing optimization objective functions incorporating mid-circuit measurement and feed-forward operations. The second contribution is incorporating these into a popular open-source quantum circuit synthesis framework. We demonstrate the generation of dynamic circuits for state preparation, long-range entangling gates, circuit optimization, and the application of dynamic circuits to lattice simulations. The resulting circuits are validated through simulation and execution on quantum hardware. Furthermore, we perform noise analysis to explore the impact of different error ratios in mid-circuit measurements and gate errors, identifying scenarios where dynamic circuits offer the most significant benefits. The dynamic circuits generated by our framework show substantial improvements in reducing circuit depth and, in some cases, the number of gates required. To our knowledge, this is the first practical procedure to generate dynamic quantum circuits. Our objective functions are independent of the underlying synthesis framework and can be easily reused. This framework opens new possibilities for circuit generation and optimization methods, highlighting the potential of dynamic circuits to enhance the performance of quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic approach to measures of total correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations play a pivotal role in various fields of science, particularly in quantum mechanics, yet their proper quantification remains a subject of debate. In this work, we aim to discuss the challenge of defining a reliable measure of total correlations. We first outline essential properties that an effective correlation measure should satisfy and review existing measures, including quantum mutual information, the p-norm of the correlation matrix, and the recently defined quantum Pearson correlation coefficient. Additionally, we introduce new measures based on R\'enyi and Tsallis relative entropies, as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our analysis reveals that while quantum mutual information, the p-norm, and the Pearson measure exhibit equivalence for two-qubit systems, they all suffer from an ordering problem. Despite criticisms regarding its reliability, we argue that quantum mutual information remains a valid measure of total correlations.</description>

Abstract: Long-lived mechanical oscillators are actively pursued as critical resources for quantum storage, sensing, and transduction. However, achieving deterministic quantum control while limiting mechanical dissipation remains a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate strong coupling between a transmon superconducting qubit and an ultra-long-lived nanomechanical oscillator ($T_\text{1} \approx 25 \text{ ms}$ at 5 GHz, $Q \approx 0.8 \times 10^9$) by leveraging the low acoustic loss in silicon and phononic bandgap engineering. The qubit-oscillator system achieves large cooperativity ($C_{T_1}\approx 1.5\times10^5$, $C_{T_2}\approx 150$), enabling the generation of non-classical states and the investigation of mechanisms underlying mechanical decoherence. We show that dynamical decoupling$\unicode{x2014}$implemented through the qubit$\unicode{x2014}$can mitigate decoherence, leading to a mechanical coherence time of $T_2\approx 1 \text{ ms}$. These findings extend the exceptional storage capabilities of mechanical oscillators to the quantum regime, putting them forward as compact bosonic elements for future applications in quantum computing and metrology.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel approach to Quantum Mechanics that we call Curved Quantum Mechanics. We introduce an infinite-dimensional K\"ahler manifold ${\cal M}$, that we call the state manifold, such that the cotangent space $T_z^*{\cal M}$ is a Hilbert space. In this approach, a state of a quantum system is described by a point in the cotangent bundle $T^*{\cal M}$, that is, by a point $z\in{\cal M}$ in the state manifold and a one-form $\psi\in T^*_z{\cal M}$. The quantum dynamics is described by an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system on the state manifold with a magnetic field $H$, which reduces to the Schr\"odinger equation for zero curvature and reduces to the equations of geodesics for zero magnetic field. The curvature of the state manifold is determined by gravity, that is, by the mass/energy of the system, so that for microscopic systems the manifold is flat and for macroscopic systems it is strongly curved, which prohibits Schr\"odinger cat type states. We solved the dynamical equations exactly for the complex projective space and the complex hyperbolic space and show that in the case of negative curvature there is a bifurcation at a critical value of the curvature. This means that for small mass all modes are in the quantum regime with the unitary periodic dynamics and for large mass there are classical modes, with not a periodic but rather an exponential time evolution leading to a collapse of the state vector.</description>

      <title>On the Bargmann invariants for quantum imaginarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imaginary in quantum theory plays a crucial role in describing quantum coherence and is widely applied in quantum information tasks such as state discrimination, pseudorandomness generation, and quantum metrology. A recent paper by Fernandes et al. [C. Fernandes, R. Wagner, L. Novo, and E. F. Galv\~ao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 190201 (2024) ] showed how to use the Bargmann invariant to witness the imaginarity of a set of quantum states. In this work, we delve into the structure of Bargmann invariants and their quantum realization in qubit systems. First, we present a characterization of special sets of Bargmann invariants (also studied by Fernandes et al. for a set of four states) for a general set of $n$ quantum states. Then, we study the properties of the relevant Bargmann invariant set $\mathcal{B}_n$ and its quantum realization in qubit systems. Our results provide new insights into the structure of Bargmann invariants, contributing to the advancement of quantum information techniques, particularly within qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simultaneous Protocols without Public Coins using Modified Equality Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a quantum version of the multiparty simultaneous message-passing (SMP) model, and we show that in some cases, quantum communication can replace public randomness, even with no entanglement between the parties. This was already known for two players, but not for more than two players, and indeed, so far all that was known was a negative result. Our main technical contribution is a compiler that takes any classical public-coin simultaneous protocol based on "modified equality queries," and converts it into a quantum simultaneous protocol without public coins with roughly the same communication complexity. We then use our compiler to derive protocols for several problems, including frequency moments, neighborhood diversity, enumeration of isolated cliques, and more.</description>

      <title>The robustness of entanglement in non-Hermitian cavity optomechanical system even away from exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum physics can be extended into the complex domain by considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that are $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric. These exhibit exceptional points (EPs) where the eigenspectrum changes from purely real to purely imaginary values and have useful properties enabling applications such as accelerated entanglement generation and the delay of the sudden death of entanglement in noisy systems. An interesting question is whether similar beneficial effects can be achieved away from EPs, since this would extend the available parameter space and make experiments more accessible. We investigate this by considering the more general case of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians where two-mode squeezing interactions are incorporated into a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric optomechanical system. The addition of squeezing is motivated by an attempt to extend the lifetime of the system's entanglement. We derive analytic expressions for the entanglement dynamics under noise-free conditions and present numerical simulations that include the effects of noise. Although we find that the two-mode squeezing interactions do not generally preserve the initial entanglement, rich dynamics are observed in both the pseudo-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric cases, including the sudden death and revival of entanglement under certain conditions. We find that the sudden disappearance of entanglement can be mitigated at EPs (similar to $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems) but also show that the revival of entanglement is quite robust to thermal noise in a group of parameters away from the EPs. Our study extends our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and opens a new perspective for the development of quantum devices in non-Hermitian systems even away from EPs.</description>

      <title>Effective description of open quantum dynamics in relativistic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open dynamics of quantum particles in relativistic scattering is investigated. In particular, we consider the scattering process of quantum particles coupled to an environment initially in a vacuum state. Tracing out the environment and using the unitarity of S-operator, we find the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator describing the evolution of the particles. The GKSL generator is exemplified by focusing on the concrete processes: one is the decay of scalar particle ($\phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$), and the others are the pair annihilation and the $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering of scalar particles ($\phi \phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ and $\phi \phi \rightarrow \phi \phi$). The GKSL generator for $\phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ has a parameter with the coupling between $\phi$ and $\chi$ and the mass of both fields. The GKSL generator associated with $\phi \phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ is characterized by a Lorentz-invariant function of initial momenta. Especially, in the pair annihilation process, we show that the probability of pair annihilation varies depending on the superposition state of incident scalar $\phi$ particles. Furthermore, we observe that the GKSL generators derived in this paper have Poincar\'e symmetry. This means that the description by the GKSL generator with Poincar\'e symmetry is effective for the asymptotic behavior of open quantum dynamics in the long-term processes of interest.</description>

      <title>Efficient estimation of error bounds for quantum multiparametric imaging with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08199v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced super-resolution imaging techniques require specific approaches for accurate and consistent estimation of the achievable spatial resolution. Fisher information supplied to Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) has proved to be a powerful and efficient tool for resolution analysis and optical setups optimization. However, the standard CRB is not applicable to constrained problems violating the unbiasedness condition, while such models are frequently encountered in quantum imaging of complex objects. Complimentary to the existing approaches based on modifying CRB, we propose a practical algorithm for approximate construction of a modified Fisher information matrix, which takes the constraints into account and can be supplied to the standard CRB. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique by applying it to 1-, 2-, and multi-parameter model problems in quantum imaging. The approach provides quantitative explanation of previous results with successful experimental reconstruction of objects with the spatial scale smaller than the theoretical limit predicted by the standard CRB.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based quantum convolutional neural network for deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are proposed, harnessing the power of quantum computing for faster training compared to the classical counterparts. However, this framework for deep learning also relies on multiple processing layers to capture the representation of data, which necessitates precise dynamical control. Given the current stage of quantum computing, achieving this level of control at a large scale remains challenging. Here, we propose an alternate approach to implementing QCNNs by utilizing cluster states. The training process of the method involves tuning the projection basis of each qubit in cluster states, rather than adjusting the parameters of layers of operators in deep quantum circuits. Hence, the whole system is easier to stabilize by avoiding the complex controls. Leveraging techniques in measurement-based quantum computing, we present an exact cluster state solution to general QCNNs. Followingly, we provide numerical evidence that both quantum and classical data can be learned by measuring cluster states, and a faster convergence of the method is observed. The cluster states we consider in our learning examples are merely square-lattice cluster states, whose implementation at large scale have been reported recently. It indicates that our method has the potential for realizing the advance of quantum deep learning for practical uses.</description>

      <title>Robust entanglement measure for mixed quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an entanglement measure, the Modified Bloch Norm ($MBN$), for finite-dimensional bipartite mixed states, based on the improved Bloch matrix criteria. $MBN$ is demonstrated to be effective in analyzing the dynamics of bound entanglement--a valuable resource for quantum protocols where free entanglement may not be available. Through examples, we illustrate the applications of $MBN$ in accurately estimating the Entanglement Sudden Death (ESD) time and detecting behaviour such as the freezing of bound entanglement. Additionally, we show that the error rate for entanglement measured using state estimation from a limited number of measurement copies is significantly lower when using $MBN$ compared to negativity. This demonstrates the robustness of $MBN$ under practical constraints.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transitions in the quantum Rabi model: Overcoming the no-go theorem through anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the superradiant phase transition (SRPT) is prohibited in the paradigmatic quantum Rabi model due to the no-go theorem caused by the $\mathbf{A}$-square term, we demonstrate two distinct types of SRPTs emerging from the normal phase in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model. A discontinuous phase transition between the two types of superradiant phases also emerges in the presence of a strong $\mathbf{A}$-square term. Additionally, a rich phase diagram featuring a triple point, which connects first- and second-order phase transitions, is derived analytically and confirmed through numerical diagonalization at large effective system sizes. Finally, distinct critical behavior at the triple point is revealed and contrasted with that of a single continuous SRPT. This work may open a new avenue for observing SRPTs in their intrinsic form without altering the $\mathbf{A}$-square term, while also offering a practical platform for exploring rich quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is an emergent field in which quantum dynamical systems are exploited for temporal information processing. In previous work, it was found a feature that makes a quantum reservoir valuable: contractive dynamics of the quantum reservoir channel toward input-dependent fixed points. These results are enhanced in this paper by finding conditions that guarantee a crucial aspect of the reservoir's design: distinguishing between different input sequences to ensure a faithful representation of temporal input data. This is implemented by finding a condition that guarantees injectivity in reservoir computing filters, with a special emphasis on the quantum case. We provide several examples and focus on a family of quantum reservoirs that is much used in the literature; it consists of an input-encoding quantum channel followed by a strictly contractive channel that enforces the echo state and the fading memory properties. This work contributes to analyzing valuable quantum reservoirs in terms of their input dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a toy model that obeys environmentally induced decoherence and quantum Darwinism and satisfies the decoherent histories criterion and Leggett-Garg inequalities with respect to the pointer basis. Yet, the resulting "classical" dynamics are extremely fragile and recohere after a seemingly innocent control operation. This challenges the idea that classical behaviour or the Multiverse branches can be identified by looking at the universal wave function alone. It also demonstrates that quantum Darwinism is compatible with strong non-Markovianity. Possible solutions related to Markovianity, non-integrability and an operational definition of pointer states are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>High Dimensional Quantum Eavesdropping: A Hypothetical Attack on BB84 &amp; SSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution algorithms are considered secure because they leverage quantum phenomena to provide security. As such, eavesdroppers can be detected by analyzing the error rate in the shared key obtained by the parties performing the key exchange. Nevertheless, this paper developed and investigated a novel attack strategy capable of being undetected through error analysis of the shared key. Said attack entails an eavesdropper measuring the quantum channel (i.e., the channel used to transmit quantum particles between two parties) using a higher dimension than that used by the legitimate parties. By measuring a particle in a dimension that spans all possible states in a given quantum key distribution algorithm, the collapsed state of the measured particle should be undetectable when measured in the lower dimension. To analyze the proposed high-dimensional eavesdropping attack, the simulator Cirq was used to model the attack on BB84, a four-dimensional variant of BB84, and the Six-State Protocol. The results of these simulations show the efficiency of this attack, with an eavesdropper being undetectable through quantum bit error rate analysis in each algorithm This promotes the need for further analysis of the high-dimensional eavesdropping attack on physical hardware and other quantum key distribution algorithms</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Quantum-Token Protocol Benchmarked on IBM Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tokens envision to store unclonable authentication keys in quantum states that are issued by a bank for example. In contrast to quantum communication, the information is not transmitted, but rather used for personal authentication in a physical device. Still, its experimental realization faces many technical challenges. In this work, we propose an ensemble-based quantum-token protocol, making these applications technologically less-demanding. A simple and minimal model is developed to describe the quantum token hardware, while the protocol is fully benchmarked and compared on five different IBM quantum processors. First, the uncertainties of the hardware are characterized, from which the main quality parameters that describe the token can be extracted. Following that, the fraction of qubits which the bank prepares and measures successfully is benchmarked. These fractions are then compared with the values obtained from an attacker who attempts to read the bank token and prepare a forged key. From which we experimentally demonstrate an acceptance probability of 0.057 for a forged token, in contrast to 0.999 for the bank's own tokens. These values can be further optimized by increasing the number of tokens in the device. Finally, we show that minor improvements in the hardware quality lead to significant increases in the protocol security, denoting a great potential of the protocol to scale with the ongoing quantum hardware evolution. We provide an open source tool with graphical user interface to benchmark the protocol with custom ensemble based qubits. This work demonstrates the overall security of the protocol within a hardware-agnostic framework, further confirming the interoperability of the protocol in arbitrary quantum systems and thus paving the way for future applications with different qubits.</description>

      <title>Bounding Large-Scale Bell Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequalities are an important tool for studying non-locality, however quickly become computationally intractable as the system size grows. We consider a novel method for finding an upper bound for the quantum violation of such inequalities by combining the NPA hierarchy, the method of alternating projections, and the memory-efficient optimisation algorithm L-BFGS. Whilst our method may not give the tightest upper bound possible, it often does so several orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art solvers, with minimal memory usage, thus allowing solutions to problems that would otherwise be intractable. We benchmark using the well-studied I3322 inequality as well as a more general large-scale randomized inequality RXX22. For randomized inequalities with 130 inputs either side (a first-level moment matrix of size 261x261), our method is ~100x faster than both MOSEK and SCS whilst giving a bound only ~2% above the optimum.</description>

Abstract: We give a new construction of binary quantum codes that enables the generation of a CSS-T code from any given CSS code. Using this construction, we prove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a previously open problem in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same result holds for binary quantum low-density parity check CSS-T codes, and establish the existence of asymptotically good CSS codes that support any given $Z$ rotation transversally. Finally, we analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from our construction.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced belief propagation for LDPC decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding low-density parity-check codes is critical in many current technologies, such as fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks and satellite communications. The belief propagation algorithm allows for fast decoding due to the low density of these codes. However, there is scope for improvement to this algorithm both in terms of its computational cost when decoding large codes and its error-correcting abilities. Here, we introduce the quantum-enhanced belief propagation (QEBP) algorithm, in which the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) acts as a pre-processing step to belief propagation. We perform exact simulations of syndrome decoding with QAOA, whose result guides the belief propagation algorithm, leading to faster convergence and a lower block error rate (BLER). In addition, through the repetition code, we study the possibility of having shared variational parameters between syndromes and, in this case, code lengths. We obtain a unique pair of variational parameters for level-1 QAOA by optimizing the probability of successful decoding through a transfer matrix method. Then, using these parameters, we compare the scaling of different QAOA post-processing techniques with code length.</description>

      <title>Minimizing resource overhead in fusion-based quantum computation using hybrid spin-photon devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three schemes for constructing a (2,2)-Shor-encoded 6-ring photonic resource state for fusion-based quantum computing, each relying on a different type of photon source. We benchmark these architectures by analyzing their ability to achieve the best-known loss tolerance threshold for fusion-based quantum computation using the target resource state. More precisely, we estimate their minimum hardware requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation in terms of the number of photon sources to achieve on-demand generation of resource states with a desired generation period. Notably, we find that a group of 12 deterministic single-photon sources containing a single matter qubit degree of freedom can produce the target resource state near-deterministically by exploiting entangling gates that are repeated until success. The approach is fully modular, eliminates the need for lossy large-scale multiplexing, and reduces the overhead for resource-state generation by several orders of magnitude compared to architectures using heralded single-photon sources and probabilistic linear-optical entangling gates. Our work shows that the use of deterministic single-photon sources embedding a qubit substantially shortens the path toward fault-tolerant photonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be faster than linear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>

      <title>Determining Absolute Neutrino Mass using Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino mass require high-precision measurements of $\beta$-decay electron energies close to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high phase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the implementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow extended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately measure the kinetic energies of individual $\beta$-decay electrons generated in these dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron radiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) technique can benefit from recent developments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and electrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron kinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can be performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states. Quantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency measurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal observation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies in these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies for Neutrino Mass (QTNM) project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental apparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a sensitivity on the order of 10~meV/$c^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesize results of previous works to give a coherent and self-consistent account of parametric resonance in a modulated quasi-1D Bose gas in the presence of a dissipative mechanism. The resonant behaviour is shown to be largely in line with the predictions of a phenomenological model published in 2014, while the associated dissipation rate is consistent with that derived in 2022 from three-wave mixing processes between the produced phonons and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>High-contrast absorption magnetometry in the visible to near-infrared range with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has so far been measured via emission of light from NV centers or via absorption at the singlet transition at 1042 nm. Here, we demonstrate a phenomenon of broadband optical absorption by the NV centers starting in the emission wavelength and reaching up to 1000 nm. The measurements are enabled by a high-finesse cavity, which is used for room temperature continuous wave pump-probe experiments. The red to infrared probe beam shows the typical optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signal of the NV spin with contrasts up to 42 %. This broadband optical absorption is not yet reported in terms of NV magnetometry. We argue that the lower level of the absorbing transition could be the energetically lower NV singlet state, based on the increased optical absorption for a resonant microwave field and the spectral behavior. Investigations of the photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity show improvements with increasing probe wavelength, reaching an optimum of 7.5 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The results show significantly improved ODMR contrast compared to emission-based magnetometry. This opens a new detection wavelength regime with coherent laser signal detection for high-sensitivity NV magnetometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying Quantum Mechanical Statistics in Italian Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.</description>

      <title>Agents for self-driving laboratories applied to quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully automated self-driving laboratories are promising to enable high-throughput and large-scale scientific discovery by reducing repetitive labour. However, effective automation requires deep integration of laboratory knowledge, which is often unstructured, multimodal, and difficult to incorporate into current AI systems. This paper introduces the k-agents framework, designed to support experimentalists in organizing laboratory knowledge and automating experiments with agents. Our framework employs large language model-based agents to encapsulate laboratory knowledge including available laboratory operations and methods for analyzing experiment results. To automate experiments, we introduce execution agents that break multi-step experimental procedures into state machines, interact with other agents to execute each step and analyze the experiment results. The analyzed results are then utilized to drive state transitions, enabling closed-loop feedback control. To demonstrate its capabilities, we applied the agents to calibrate and operate a superconducting quantum processor, where they autonomously planned and executed experiments for hours, successfully producing and characterizing entangled quantum states at the level achieved by human scientists. Our knowledge-based agent system opens up new possibilities for managing laboratory knowledge and accelerating scientific discovery.</description>

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) systems excel in recognising and classifying images with remarkable accuracy. However, like many computer software systems, they can fail by generating confusing or erroneous outputs or by deferring to human operators to interpret the results and make final decisions. In this paper, we employ the recently proposed quantum-tunnelling neural networks (QT-NNs), inspired by human brain processes, alongside quantum cognition theory, to classify image datasets while emulating human perception and judgment. Our findings suggest that the QT-NN model provides compelling evidence of its potential to replicate human-like decision-making and outperform traditional ML algorithms.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological re-entrant phase transition in a generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of the one-dimensional generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The results reveal that topological re-entrant phase transition emerges. Through the analysis of a real-space winding number , we divide the emergent topological re-entrant phase transitions into two types. The first is the re-entrant phase transition from the traditional topological insulator phase into the topological Anderson insulator phase, and the second is the re-entrant phenomenon from one topological Anderson insulator phase into another topological Anderson insulator phase. These two types of re-entrant phase transition correspond to bounded and unbounded cases of quasiperiodic modulation, respectively. Furthermore, we verify the above topological re-entrant phase transitions by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and bulk gap. Since Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models have been realized in various artificial systems (such as cold atoms, optical waveguide arrays, ion traps, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), the two types of topological re-entrant phase transition predicted in this paper are expected to be realized in the near future.</description>

      <title>Role of quantum geometric tensor on wavepacket dynamics in two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the local geometry of quantum states, and its components directly account for the dynamical effects observed, e.g., in condensed matter systems. In this work, we address the problem of extending the QGT formalism to non-Hermitian systems with gain and loss. In particular, we investigate a wave-packet dynamics in two-band non-Hermitian systems to elucidate how non-Hermiticity affects the definition of QGT. We employ first-order perturbation theory to account for non-adiabatic corrections due to interband mixing. Our results suggest that two different generalizations of the QGT, one defined using only the right eigenstates and the other one using both the left and right eigenstates, both play a significant role in wave-packet dynamics. We then determine the accuracy of the perturbative approach by simulating a wave-packet dynamics in a well studied physical non-Hermitian system -- exciton polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity. Our work aids deeper understanding of quantum geometry and dynamical behaviour in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic quantum theory for nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductor quantum well heterostructures operating in the regime of ultra-strong light matter coupling regime. This work extends the Power-Zienau-Wooley (PZW) formulation of quantum electrodynamics to account for nonlinear interactions based on a fully fermionic approach, without resorting to any bosonization approximation. It provides a unified description of the microcavity and the local field enhancement effects on the nonlinear optical response, thus encompassing the phenomena known as epsilon near zero (ENZ) effect. In particular, our theory describes the impact of the light-matter coupled states on the high frequency generation process, relevant for recent experimental investigations with polaritonic metasurfaces. We unveil the limitations of traditional single-particle approaches and propose novel design principles to optimize nonlinear conversion efficiencies in dense, microcavity-coupled electronic systems. The theoretical framework developed here provides an efficient tool for the development of advanced quantum optical applications in the mid-infrared and terahertz spectral domains. Furthermore, it establishes a foundation for exploring the quantum properties of the ultra-strong light-matter regime through frequency-converted polariton states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confining electrons or holes in quantum dots formed in the channel of industry-standard fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS structures is a promising approach to scalable qubit architectures. In this communication, we present measurement results of a commercial nanostructure fabricated using the GlobalFoundries 22FDX(TM) industrial process. We demonstrate here that quantum dots are formed in the device channel by applying a combination of a back- and gate voltages. We report our results on an effective detuning of the energy levels in the quantum dots by varying the barrier gate voltages in combination with the back-gate voltage. Given the need and importance of scaling to larger numbers of qubits, we demonstrate here the feasibility of single-electron box sensors at the edge of the quantum dot array for effective charge sensing in different operation modes -- sensing charge transitions in a single- and double quantum dots forming the quantum dot array. We also report measurement results demonstrating bias triangle pair formation and precise control over coupled quantum dots with variations in the inter-dot barrier. The reported measurement results demonstrate the ability to control the formation and coupling of multiple quantum dots in a quantum dot array and to sense their charge state via a Single Electron Box sensor in a commercial process for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.03892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Gordon decomposition of the magnetizability of a Dirac one-electron atom in an arbitrary discrete energy eigenstate, with a pointlike, spinless, and motionless nucleus of charge $Ze$. The external magnetic field, by which the atomic state is perturbed, is assumed to be weak, static, and uniform. Using the Sturmian expansion of the generalized Dirac--Coulomb Green function proposed by Szmytkowski in 1997, we derive a closed-form expressions for the diamagnetic ($\chi_{d}$) and paramagnetic ($\chi_{p}$) contributions to $\chi$. Our calculations are purely analytical; the received formula for $\chi_{p}$ contains the generalized hypergeometric functions ${}_3F_2$ of the unit argument, while $\chi_{d}$ is of an elementary form. For the atomic ground state, both results reduce to the formulas obtained earlier by other author. This work is a prequel to our recent article, where the numerical values of $\chi_{d}$ and $\chi_{p}$ for some excited states of selected hydrogenlike ions with $1 \leqslant Z \leqslant 137$ were obtained with the use of the general formulas derived here.</description>

      <title>Calibration of syndrome measurements in a single experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction can reduce the effects of noise in quantum systems, e.g. in metrology or most notably in quantum computing. Typically, this requires making measurements that provide information about the errors that have occurred in the system. However, these syndrome measurements themselves introduce noise into the system, for example by using noisy gates. A complete characterization of the measurements is very costly. Here we describe a calibration method to obtain the syndrome statistics taking into account the additional noise sources. All calibration data are extracted from a single experiment in which the syndrome measurement is performed twice in a row. Thus, our method allows an accurate evaluation of syndrome measurements with significantly less effort than existing methods. We give examples of the application of this method to noise estimation and error correction. Finally, we discuss the results of experiments performed on an IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Quantum Measurements for Robustness Against Dark Counts: The $D$-Trace Optimality Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum communication, while promising unparalleled security, faces significant practical challenges due to imperfections in quantum devices, particularly in single-photon detectors (SPDs). One of the key issues is the impact of dark counts, which cause erroneous detections and limit the effective range of quantum communication systems, such as in quantum key distribution (QKD). In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for addressing dark count errors through a new optimality criterion, termed $D$-trace optimality. This criterion aims to optimize quantum measurements to minimize the impact of dark counts without relying on hardware replacements. We propose an optimization scheme that transforms general measurements into $D$-trace optimal measurements, ensuring robustness against dark count effects. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, this approach can improve the performance of quantum communication systems, especially in scenarios where the prior distribution of states is known. Although challenges remain in obtaining accurate prior distributions and ensuring compatibility with other strategies. This work lays the foundation for future research on optimizing quantum measurements to mitigate the effects of noise, including dark counts, in practice.</description>

      <title>Expanding bipartite Bell inequalities for maximum multi-partite randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal tests on multi-partite quantum correlations form the basis of protocols that certify randomness in a device-independent (DI) way. Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate test difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, but achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which can reduce the rate of randomness generation. As a result there is often a trade-off between maximum randomness and the amount of violation of a given Bell inequality. Here, we explore this trade-off for more than two parties. More precisely, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations exhibiting a violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. We find that maximum quantum violation and maximum randomness are incompatible for any even number of parties, with incompatibility diminishing as the number of parties grows, and conjecture the precise trade-off. We also show that maximum MABK violation is not necessary for maximum randomness for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a technique for randomness certification, which we call ``expanding Bell inequalities''. Our technique allows a bipartite Bell expression to be used as a seed, and transformed into a multi-partite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>ADAPT-QSCI: Adaptive Construction of an Input State for Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for calculating the ground state and its energy of the quantum many-body Hamiltonian by proposing an adaptive construction of a quantum state for the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method. QSCI allows us to select important electronic configurations in the system to perform CI calculation (subspace diagonalization of the Hamiltonian) by sampling measurement for a proper input quantum state on a quantum computer, but how we prepare a desirable input state has remained a challenge. We propose an adaptive construction of the input state for QSCI in which we run QSCI repeatedly to grow the input state iteratively. We numerically illustrate that our method, dubbed ADAPT-QSCI, can yield accurate ground-state energies for small molecules, including a noisy situation for eight qubits where error rates of two-qubit gates and the measurement are both as large as 1%. ADAPT-QSCI serves as a promising method to take advantage of current noisy quantum devices and pushes forward its application to quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced in Parra-Rodriguez et al. (2024), we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular--a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work will provide a solid ground for a precise non-divergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.</description>

      <title>Early Exploration of a Flexible Framework for Efficient Quantum Linear Solvers in Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid integration of renewable energy resources presents formidable challenges in managing power grids. While advanced computing and machine learning techniques offer some solutions for accelerating grid modeling and simulation, there remain complex problems that classical computers cannot effectively address. Quantum computing, a promising technology, has the potential to fundamentally transform how we manage power systems, especially in scenarios with a higher proportion of renewable energy sources. One critical aspect is solving large-scale linear systems of equations, crucial for power system applications like power flow analysis, for which the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a well-known quantum solution. However, HHL quantum circuits often exhibit excessive depth, making them impractical for current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework, powered by NWQSim, that bridges the gap between power system applications and quantum linear solvers available in Qiskit. This framework empowers researchers to efficiently explore power system applications using quantum linear solvers. Through innovative gate fusion strategies, reduced circuit depth, and GPU acceleration, our simulator significantly enhances resource efficiency. Power flow case studies have demonstrated up to a eight-fold speedup compared to Qiskit Aer, all while maintaining comparable levels of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing Hamiltonian models for quantum processors with many qubits on the same chip is crucial for advancing quantum computing technologies. Stray couplings between qubits lead to errors in gate operations. This study underscores the importance of incorporating lattice Hamiltonians into quantum circuit design. By comparing many-body effects with two-body stray couplings, we show how adjusting circuit parameters can enhance two-qubit gate fidelity. We find that loosely decoupled qubits result in weaker stray interactions and higher gate fidelity, challenging conventional assumptions. We investigate the scenario where three-body $ZZZ$ interaction surpasses two-body $ZZ$ interactions, highlighting the transformative potential of lattice Hamiltonians for novel multi-qubit gates. Moreover, we investigate the cross-resonance gate within the lattice Hamiltonian framework and examine the impact of microwave pulses on stray coupling. This emphasizes the necessity of developing a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes lattice interactions, which are now critical given the sophistication of contemporary quantum hardware. These insights are vital for developing fault-tolerant quantum computing and next-generation quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent spin-phonon coupling of boron-vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron-vacancy center ($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a highly promising quantum sensor. Compared to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, the change with temperature of the spin transition energy of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ is more than an order of magnitude larger, making it a potential nanoscale thermometer with superior sensitivity. However, the underlying mechanism of the observed large temperature dependence remains an open question. In this work, using isotopically purified $\mathrm{h}{}^{10}\mathrm{B}{}^{15}\mathrm{N}$, we systematically characterize the zero-field splitting, hyperfine interaction, and spin relaxation time of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ from 10 to 350$~$K. We carry out first-principle calculations of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin-phonon interaction and show that a second-order effect from finite-temperature phonon excitations is responsible for the observed changes in experiments. By fitting our experimental results to a physically motivated model, we extract the dominant phonon mode which agrees well with our simulations. Finally, we investigate the dynamic nuclear spin polarization process at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide key insights in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centers and their utilization as nanoscale thermometers and phonon sensors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Teleportation versus Information Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is the phenomenon in which locally inaccessible energy is activated as extractable work through collaborative local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with an entangled partner. It closely resembles the more well-known quantum information teleportation (QIT) where quantum information can be sent through an entangled pair with LOCC. It is tempting to ask how QET is related to QIT. Here we report a first study of this connection. Despite the apparent similarity, we show that these two phenomena are not only distinct but moreover are mutually competitive. We show a perturbative trade-off relation between their performance in a thermal entangled chaotic many-body system, in which both QET and QIT are simultaneously implemented through a traversable wormhole in an emergent spacetime. Motivated by this example, we study a generic setup of two entangled qudits and prove a universal non-perturbative trade-off bound. It shows that for any teleportation protocol, the overall performance of QET and QIT together is constrained by the entanglement resource. We discuss some explanations of our results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sensors capitalize on advanced control sequences for maximizing sensitivity and precision. However, protocols are not usually optimized for temporal resolution. Here, we establish the limits for time-resolved sensing of dynamical signals using qubit probes. We show that the best possible time resolution is closely related to the quantum speed limit (QSL), which describes the minimum time needed to transform between basis states. We further show that a composite control sequence consisting of two phase-shifted pulses reaches the QSL. Practical implementation is discussed based on the example of the spin-1 qutrit of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond.</description>

It is shown how the reduction allows to generate the scattering matrices of new quantum graphs from assembling of simpler graphs. The reduction of quantum channels is also defined. The implementation of the quantum gates corresponding to the reduced unitary operator is investigated, although no explicit construction is presented. The situation is different for the reduction of quantum channels for which explicit implementations are given.</description>

      <title>Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubit Generation via Approximate Squeezed Coherent State Superposition Breeding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement based methods can produce high quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed coherent state superpositions created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than strictly photon number resolving measurement based methods, while still producing states with high-fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.</description>

      <title>Topological Order in the Spectral Riemann Surfaces of Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show topologically ordered states in the complex-valued spectra of non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive exceptional points in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This process results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that can be identified with a Fermi arc. Building on an analogy to Kitaev's toric code, these cut lines form non-contractible loops, which parallel the defect lines of the toric-code ground states. Their presence or absence establishes topological order for fully non-degenerate non-Hermitian systems. Excitations above these ground-state analogs are characterized by the occurrence of additional exceptional points. We illustrate the characteristics of the topologically protected states in a non-Hermitian two-band model and provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as an emitter. Time-modulating driving stimulates the emitter to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to that of other generation methods for propagating states, which suggests a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy Circuits with Naturally Fault-Tolerant Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the output distribution of low-depth noisy Clifford circuits with any product-state inputs and final single-qubit measurements in any basis. This class of circuits includes Clifford-magic circuits and Conjugated-Clifford circuits, which are important candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage using non-universal gates. Additionally, our results generalize a simulation algorithm for IQP circuits [Rajakumar et. al, SODA'25] to the case of IQP circuits augmented with CNOT gates, which is another class of non-universal circuits that are relevant to current experiments. Importantly, our results do not require randomness assumptions over the circuit families considered (such as anticoncentration properties) and instead hold for every circuit in each class. This allows us to place tight limitations on the robustness of these circuits to noise. In particular, we show that there is no quantum advantage at large depths with realistically noisy Clifford circuits, even with perfect magic state inputs, or IQP circuits with CNOT gates, even with arbitrary diagonal non-Clifford gates. The key insight behind the algorithm is that interspersed noise causes a decay of long-range entanglement, and at depths beyond a critical threshold, the noise builds up to an extent that most correlations can be classically simulated. To prove our results, we merge techniques from percolation theory with tools from Pauli path analysis.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

Abstract: Measurement is an essential component for robust and practical quantum computation. For superconducting qubits, the measurement process involves the effective manipulation of the joint qubit-resonator dynamics, and should ideally provide the highest quality for qubit state discrimination with the shortest readout pulse and resonator reset time. Here, we harness model-free reinforcement learning (RL) together with a tailored training environment to achieve this multi-pronged optimization task. We demonstrate on the IBM quantum device that the measurement pulse obtained by the RL agent not only successfully achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an assignment error of $(4.6 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-3}$, but also executes the readout and the subsequent resonator reset almost 3x faster than the system's default process. Furthermore, the learned waveforms are robust against realistic parameter drifts and follow a generalized analytical form, making them readily implementable in practice with no significant computation overhead. Our results provide an effective readout strategy to boost the performance of superconducting quantum processors and demonstrate the prowess of RL in providing optimal and experimentally informed solutions for complex quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Fast Laplace transforms on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$ as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, machine learning, and finance.</description>

      <title>Coherent postionization dynamics of molecules based on adiabatic strong-field approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taking N2 and O2 as examples, we theoretically study the post-ionization dynamics of molecules in strong laser fields using a density matrix method for open systems, focusing on the effect of ionization-produced coherence on the dynamics of residual ions. We introduce the adiabatic strong-field approximation (ASFA) method to predict the coherences between ionic states resulting from multiorbital strong-field ionizations. Compared with the standard SFA, the ASFA method can be applied across a wide range of laser intensities due to the consideration of orbital distortion effects. Based on the ASFA, it is found that there are obvious coherences between ionic states in residual molecular ions. These coherences significantly influence the transitions between ionic states, which finally change the post-ionization dynamics of molecular ions. Our findings reveal the importance of the ionization-produced coherences in modulating post-ionization molecular dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics in response to time-dependent external potentials of the edge modes of a small fractional quantum Hall fluid composed of few particles on a lattice in a bosonic Laughlin-like state at filling {\nu} = 1/2. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattices that are available in state-of-the-art experiments, away from the continuum limit. Experimentally-accessible data related to the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in both the linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Van den Broeck limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. This is for the first time, we see that in the same setup and using quantum point contacts, the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear response being achieved.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phases of free fermion systems with U(1) symmetry. Following a recent approach developed for Majorana chains, we derive a field theory description for the purity and bipartite entanglement at large space and time scales. We focus on a multi-flavor one-dimensional chain with random complex hoppings and continuous monitoring of the local fermion density. By means of the replica trick, and using the number of flavors as a large parameter controlling our approximations, we derive an effective field theory made up of a SU(N) non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) coupled to fluctuating hydrodynamics. Contrary to the case of non-interacting Majorana fermions, displaying no U(1) symmetry, we find that the bipartite entanglement entropy satisfies an area law for all monitoring rates, but with a nontrivial scaling of entanglement when the correlation length is large. We provide numerical evidence supporting our claims. We briefly show how imposing a reality condition on the hoppings can change the NL$\sigma$M and also discuss higher dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect: Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in single-channel Kondo couplings is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have achieved linear arrays exceeding ten qubits. Moving to two-dimensional (2D) qubit arrays is a critical next step to advance towards fault-tolerant implementations, but it poses substantial fabrication challenges, particularly because enabling control of nearest-neighbor entanglement requires the incorporation of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in the qubit architecture. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all adjacent dots. The device is characterized at 4.2 K, where we demonstrate the formation and isolation of double-dot and triple-dot configurations. We show control of all nearest-neighbor tunnel couplings spanning up to 30 decades per volt through the interstitial exchange gates and use advanced modeling tools to estimate the exchange interactions that could be realized among qubits in this architecture. These results represent a significant step towards the development of 2D MOS quantum processors compatible with foundry manufacturing techniques.</description>

Abstract: The development of novel radio frequency atomic receivers brings attention to the theoretical description of atom-light interactions in sophisticated, multilevel schemes. Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.</description>
