      <title>Linear Logic and the Hilbert Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric model of shallow multiplicative exponential linear logic (MELL) using the Hilbert scheme. Building on previous work interpreting multiplicative linear logic proofs as systems of linear equations, we show that shallow MELL proofs can be modeled by locally projective schemes. The key insight is that while multiplicative linear logic proofs correspond to equations between formulas, the exponential fragment of shallow proofs corresponds to equations between these equations. We prove that the model is invariant under cut-elimination by constructing explicit isomorphisms between the schemes associated to proofs related by cut-reduction steps. A key technical tool is the interpretation of the exponential modality using the Hilbert scheme, which parameterizes closed subschemes of projective space. We demonstrate the model through detailed examples, including an analysis of Church numerals that reveals how the Hilbert scheme captures the geometric content of promoted formulas. This work establishes new connections between proof theory and algebraic geometry, suggesting broader relationships between computation and scheme theory.</description>

      <title>On a Question of Hamkins'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joel Hamkins asks whether there is a $\Pi^0_1$-formula $\rho(x)$ such that $\rho({\ulcorner \phi \urcorner})$ is independent over ${\sf PA}+\phi$, if this theory is consistent, where this construction is extensional in $\phi$ with respect to {\sf PA}-provable equivalence. We show that there can be no such extensional Rosser formula of any complexity. We give a positive answer to Hamkins' question for the case where we replace Extensionality by a weaker demand that we call \emph{Conditional Extensionality}. For this case, we prove an even stronger result, to wit, there is a $\Pi^0_1$-formula $\rho(x)$ that is extensional and $\Pi^0_1$-flexible. We leave one important question open: what happens when we weaken Extensionality to Consistent Extensionality, i.e., Extensionality for consistent extensions?</description>

      <title>Notes on ultrafilter extensions of almost bounded structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend some of our earlier results on the interconnection between ultrafilter extensions, and ultrapowers. Throughout we restrict ourselves to relational structures with one binary relation. Recently it was shown that for bounded structures, where a universal finite bound on the maximal in-and out-degree is given, ultrafilter extensions are elementary extensions of the original structures. Comparing the constructions, it seems that the real challenge is when the degree has no global finite bound, or there are elements with infinite degree. This is a first step towards this direction by slightly relaxing the notion of boundedness, called almost bounded structures. Among others, we show that members of this class are still elementary substructures of their extensions, elementary embeddings can be lifted up to the extensions, moreover for the countable case, the extensions are isomorphic to certain ultrapowers. We also comment on the modal logics they generate.</description>

      <title>A Cut-free Sequent Calculus for Basic Intuitionistic Dynamic Topological Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of a broader family of logics, [1, 3] introduced two key logical systems: $\mathsf{iK_{d}}$, which encapsulates the basic logical structure of dynamic topological systems, and $\mathsf{iK_{d*}}$, which provides a well-behaved yet sufficiently general framework for an abstract notion of implication. These logics have been thoroughly examined through their algebraic, Kripke-style, and topological semantics. To complement these investigations with their missing proof-theoretic analysis, this paper introduces a cut-free G3-style sequent calculus for $\mathsf{iK_{d}}$ and $\mathsf{iK_{d*}}$. Using these systems, we demonstrate that they satisfy the disjunction property and, more broadly, admit a generalization of Visser's rules. Additionally, we establish that $\mathsf{iK_{d}}$ enjoys the Craig interpolation property and that its sequent system possesses the deductive interpolation property.</description>

      <title>Chang models over derived models with supercompact measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on earlier work of the third author, we construct a Chang-type model with supercompact measures extending a derived model of a given hod mouse with a regular cardinal $\delta$ that is both a limit of Woodin cardinals and a limit of ${&lt;}\delta$-strong cardinals. The existence of such a hod mouse is consistent relative to a Woodin cardinal that is a limit of Woodin cardinals. We argue that our Chang-type model satisfies $\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}} + \Theta$ is regular + $\omega_1$ is ${&lt;}\delta_{\infty}$-supercompact for some regular cardinal $\delta_{\infty}&gt;\Theta$. This complements Woodin's generalized Chang model, which satisfies $\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}+\omega_1$ is supercompact, assuming a proper class of Woodin cardinals that are limits of Woodin cardinals.</description>
