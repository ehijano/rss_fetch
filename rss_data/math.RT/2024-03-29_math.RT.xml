      <title>Cochain complexes over a functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose unifying the categories of cochain complexes $\text{Ch}(\mathcal{C})$ and modules $\widehat{A}\text{-mod}$ over a repetitive algebra $\widehat{A}$. Motivated by their striking similarities and importance, we introduce a novel category encompassing both. Our analysis explores key properties of this unified category, highlighting its parallels and divergences from the original structures. We study whether it preserves crucial aspects like limits, colimits, products, coproducts, and abelianity. Besides, we establish a family of projective and injective indecomposable objects within this framework. Moving beyond theoretical foundations, we examine the influence and interaction over these novel categories of the category of endofunctors and its monoidal structure. Finally, we explore the implications of our constructions over representation theory of algebras and algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Triangulated structure for Bondarenko's Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V. Bondarenko and Y. Drozd gives a description of all indecomposable objects in a category of representations of posets, nowadays known as the Bondarenko's category. This category was essential for V. Bekkert and H. Merklen classify all indecomposable objects of the derived category of gentle algebras. In view of this connection with the derived category, which possess a triangulated structure, and of the fact that in this paper we show that the Bondarenko's category is not an abelian category, it is reasonable to contemplate the existence of a triangulated structure for the Bondarenko's category.
  In this paper we introduce a triangulated category structure over a quotient of Bondarenko's category, which will allow to use the techniques of triangulated category to study representations of posets.</description>

      <title>Narrow, wide, and $\lambda$-wide regular subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra is wide if every simple module of the semisimple Lie algebra remains indecomposable when restricted to the subalgebra. From a finer viewpoint, a subalgebra is $\lambda$-wide if the simple module of a semisimple Lie algebra of highest weight $\lambda$ remains indecomposable when restricted to the subalgebra. A subalgebra is narrow if the restriction of all non-trivial simple modules to the subalgebra have proper decompositions. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions for regular subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras to be $\lambda$-wide. As a natural consequence, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for regular subalgebras to be wide, a result which has already been established by Panyushev for essentially all regular solvable subalgebras. Next, we show that establishing whether or not a regular subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra is wide does not require consideration of all simple modules. It is necessary and sufficient to only consider the adjoint representation. Finally, we show that a regular subalgebra of the special linear algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ is either narrow or wide; this property does not hold for non-regular subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>Action of the relative Weyl group on partial Springer sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the Springer correspondence, the Weyl group action on the Springer sheaf can be defined in two ways: via restriction or the Fourier transform. It is well-known that these two actions differ by the sign character. This was proven by Hotta for sheaves with characteristic 0 coefficients in 1981, and more recently extended to arbitrary coefficients by Achar, Henderson, Juteau, and Riche in 2014. In this short article, we study an extension of this problem to the partial Springer sheaf with arbitrary field coefficients. This involves an action of the so-called relative Weyl group $W(L)$.</description>

      <title>Branching problem of tensoring two Verma modules and its application to differential symmetry breaking operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kobayashi-Pevzner discovered in [Selecta Math., 2016] that the failure of the multiplicity-one property in the fusion rule of Verma modules of sl2 occurs exactly when the Rankin-Cohen bracket vanishes, and 1classified all the corresponding parameters. In this paper we provide yet another characterization for these parameters, and give a precise description of indecomposable components of the tensor product. Furthermore, we discuss when the tensor products of two Verma modules are isomorphic to each other for semisimple Lie algebras g.</description>

      <title>The Cartan-Helgason theorem for supersymmetric spaces: spherical weights for Kac-Moody superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})$ be a supersymmetric pair arising from a finite-dimensional, symmetrizable Kac-Moody superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$. An important branching problem is to determine the finite-dimensional highest-weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules which admit a $\mathfrak{k}$-coinvariant, and thus appear as functions in a corresponding supersymmetric space $\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{K}$. This is the super-analogue of the Cartan-Helgason theorem. We solve this problem via a rank one reduction and an understanding of reflections in singular roots, which generalize odd reflections in the theory of Kac-Moody superalgebras. An explicit presentation of spherical weights is provided for every pair when $\mathfrak{g}$ is indecomposable.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of invariant subrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Cohen-Macaulay representations of quotient singularities $R:=l[[x_1,\cdots,x_d]]^G$ where $l$ is a field and $G$ is a finite group acting on $l[[x_1,\cdots,x_d]]$ as a ring, not necessarily as an $l$-algebra, with $|G|$ not divided by ${\rm char}\, l$. In fact, if we put $k:=l^G$, then we may assume that $G$ is a subgroup of $GL_d(l)\rtimes{\rm Gal}(l/k)$. We show that $R$ has a generator giving an NCCR and therefore when $d=2$, it is of finite Cohen-Macaulay type. Additionally, we completely describe its Auslander-Reiten quiver, which is often non-simply laced, as a quotient of a certain quiver. Moreover, we also prove that two-dimensional rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type of equicharacteristic zero are precisely quotient singularities of this form, which generalizes Esnault and Auslander's result. Combining these results, we prove that the quivers that may arise as the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a two-dimensional Gorenstein ring of finite Cohen-Macaulay type of equicharacteristic zero are either doubles of extended Dynkin diagrams or ones having loops. To accomplish these, we establish two results which are of independent interest. First, we prove the existence of $(d-1)$-almost split sequences for arbitrary Cohen-Macaulay normal rings having NCCR which are not necessarily isolated singularities. Second, we make it possible to determine simple modules over skew group algebras by relating them to those over certain group algebras.</description>

      <title>Closedness of the singular locus and generation for derived categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with a relationship regarding the closedness of the singular locus of a Noetherian scheme and existence of classical generators in its category of coherent sheaves, associated bounded derived category, and singularity category. Particularly, we extend an observation initially made by Iyengar and Takahashi in the affine context to the global setting. Furthermore, we furnish an example a Noetherian scheme whose bounded derived category admits a classical generator, yet not every finite scheme over it exhibits the same property.</description>

Abstract: We give a categorical formulation of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$,as an embedding of the derived category of locally admissible representations into the category of Ind-coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of two-dimensional representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Moreover, we relate our version of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to the cohomology of modular curves through a local-global compatibility formula.</description>

Abstract: We compute the exterior powers, with respect to the additive convolution on the general linear Lie algebra, of a parabolic Springer sheaf corresponding to a maximal parabolic subgroup of type (1, n -- 1). They turn out to be isomorphic to the semisimple perverse sheaves attached by the Springer correspondence to the exterior powers of the permutation representation of the symmetric group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on previous results on the classification of finite-dimensional Nichols algebras over dihedral groups and the characterization of simple modules of Drinfeld doubles, we compute the irreducible characters of the Drinfeld doubles of bosonizations of finite-dimensional Nichols algebras over the dihedral groups $\mathbb{D}_{4t}$ with $t\geq 3$. To this end, we develop new techniques that can be applied to Nichols algebras over any Hopf algebra. Namely, we explain how to construct recursively irreducible representations when the Nichols algebra is generated by a decomposable module, and show that the highest-weight of minimum degree in a Verma module determines its socle. We also prove that tensoring a simple module by a rigid simple module gives a semisimple module.</description>

      <title>Units of twisted group rings and their correlations to classical group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is centered around the classical problem of extracting properties of a finite group $G$ from the ring isomorphism class of its integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$. This problem is considered via describing the unit group $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z} G)$ generically for a finite group. Since the $90's$ several well known generic constructions of units are known to generate a subgroup of finite index in $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z } G)$ if $\mathbb{Q} G$ does not have so-called exceptional simple epimorphic images, e.g. $M_2 (\mathbb{Q})$. However it remained a major open problem to find a {\it generic} construction under the presence of the latter type of simple images. In this article we obtain such generic construction of units. Moreover, this new construction also exhibits new properties, such as providing generically free subgroups of large rank. As an application we answer positively for several classes of groups recent conjectures on the rank and the periodic elements of the abelianisation $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z} G)^{ab}$. To obtain all this, we investigate the group ring $R \Gamma$ of an extension $\Gamma$ of some normal subgroup $N$ by a group $G$, over a domain $R$. More precisely, we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the (twisted) group algebra of $\Gamma$ over the fraction field $F$ of $R$ in terms of various twisted group rings of $G$ over finite extensions of $F$. Furthermore, concrete information on the kernel and cokernel of the associated projections is obtained. Along the way we also launch the investigations of the unit group of twisted group rings and of $\mathcal{U}( R\Gamma)$ via twisted group rings.</description>

Abstract: For a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring $R$, we construct an affine scheme $X$ solely from DG singularity category $S_{dg}(R)$ of $R$ such that there is a finite surjective morphism $X \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$, where $\mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$ is the singular locus in $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. As an application, for two such rings with equivalent DG singularity categories, we prove that the singular loci in their affine schemes have the same dimension.</description>
