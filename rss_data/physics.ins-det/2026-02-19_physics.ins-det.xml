      <title>On-chip probabilistic inference for charged-particle tracking at the sensor edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern scientific instruments operate under increasingly extreme constraints on bandwidth, latency, and power. Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area. Our results establish a path toward probabilistic inference directly at the edge, opening new opportunities for intelligent sensing in high-rate scientific instruments.</description>

      <title>Memristive tabular variational autoencoder for compression of analog data in high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of edge AI to compress data on an in-memory analog content-addressable memory (ACAM) device. A variational autoencoder is trained on a simulated sample of energy measurements from incident high-energy electrons on a generic three-layer scintillator-based calorimeter. The encoding part is distilled into tabular format by regressing the latent space variables using decision trees, which is then programmed on a memristor-based ACAM. In real-time, the ACAM compresses 48 continuously valued incoming energies measured by the calorimeter sensors into the latent space, achieving a compression factor of 12x, which is transmitted off-detector for decompression. The performance result of the ACAM, obtained using the Structural Simulation Toolkit, the SST open source framework, gives a latency value of 24 ns and a throughput of 330M compressions per second, i.e., 3 ns between successive inputs, and an average energy consumption of 4.1 nJ per compression.</description>

      <title>Characterization of an MPPC-Based Scintillator Telescope and Measurement of Cosmic Muon Angular Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents the design, characterization, and application of a high-sensitivity optical detection system based on plastic scintillators coupled to Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs). The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\bm{\cos^n(\theta)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\bm{n = 1.44 \pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the MPPC-scintillator coupling for precise photon counting and timing applications in high-energy physics instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Scattering and sputtering on the lunar surface; Insights from negative ions observed at the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to solar wind ions, which can scatter or become implanted upon impact with the regolith-covered surface, while also sputtering surface atoms.
  Aims. We construct a semi-analytical model for the scattering of ions of hundreds of eV and the sputtering of surface atoms, both resulting in the emission of negative ions from the lunar surface. Our model contains a novel description of the scattering process that is physics-based and constrained by observations.
  Methods. We use data from the Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) instrument on the Chang'e-6 lander to update prior knowledge of ion scattering and sputtering from lunar regolith through Bayesian inference.
  Results. Our model shows good agreement with the NILS data. A precipitating solar wind proton has roughly a 22% chance of scattering from the lunar surface in any charge state, and about an 8% chance of sputtering a surface hydrogen atom. The resulting ratio of scattered to sputtered hydrogen flux is eta_sc / eta_sp = 1.5 for a proton speed of 300 km/s. We find a high probability (7-20%) that a hydrogen atom leaves the surface negatively charged. The angular emission distributions at near-grazing angles for both scattered and sputtered fluxes are controlled by surface roughness. Our model also indicates significant inelastic energy losses for hydrogen interacting with the regolith, suggesting a longer effective path length than previously assumed. Finally, we estimate a surface binding energy of 5.5 eV, consistent with the observations.
  Conclusions. Our model describes the scattering and sputtering of particles of any charge state from any homogeneous, multi-species surface. Using NILS data, we successfully applied the model to update our understanding of solar wind interacting with lunar regolith, and the emission of negative hydrogen ions.</description>

      <title>Low dose gamma irradiation study of ATLAS ITk MD8 diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon strip detectors developed for the Inner Tracker (ITk) of the ATLAS experiment will operate in a harsh radiation environment of the HL-LHC accelerator. The ITk is thus designed to endure a total fluence of 1.6E15 1MeV n_eq/cm2 and a total ionizing dose (TID) of 66 Mrad in the strip detector region. A radiation-hard n^+-in-p technology is implemented in the ITk strip sensors. To achieve the required radiation hardness, extensive irradiation studies were conducted during sensor development, primarily performed up to the maximal expected total fluence and TID to ensure a full functionality of the detector at its end-of-life. These studies included irradiations of sensors with various particle types and energies, including the Co60 gamma-rays. Our previous results obtained for gamma-irradiated diodes and strip sensors indicate a linear increase of bulk current with TID, while the surface current saturates at the lowest TID levels checked (66 Mrad), preventing a determination of the exact TID for which the observed saturation occurs. This work presents the results coming from irradiations by Co60 gamma-rays to multiple low TIDs, ranging from 0.5 to 100 krad. The detailed study of total, bulk, and surface currents of diodes explores an unknown dependence of surface current on the TID, annealing, and temperature. Additionally, the effect of the p-stop implant between the bias and the guard ring of measured samples is shown. The observations are relevant for the initial operations of the new ATLAS tracker.</description>

      <title>Commissioning the Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy Experiment at FRIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript reports on the commissioning of the Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy Experiment (RISE) at the BECOLA facility at FRIB. The new instrument implements the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of short-lived isotopes produced at FRIB. The existing BECOLA beamline was extended to integrate an electrostatic ion-beam bender and an ion detector at ultra-high vacuum. An injection-seeded Ti:Sapphire laser and a multi-harmonic pulsed Nd:YAG laser were installed to perform resonant excitation and selective ionization. Commissioning tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrument by measuring the hyperfine structure of stable $^{27}$Al produced in an offline ion source. The RISE instrument is ready and operational for future studies of short-lived isotopes at FRIB.</description>

      <title>High-Voltage Performance Testing in LAr of the PMMA Cathode Connection for the DarkSide-20k Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) is a next-generation dual-phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct-detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall-C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7 t of low-radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\,\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200 tonne-year run. In DS-20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress-cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS-20k cathode high-voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric-field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS-20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$ kV.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wavelength Lens-Absorber-Coupled Ti/Al Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents Ti/Al bi-layer Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) based on lens-coupled spiral absorbers as the quasi-optical coupling mechanism for millimeter-wavelength radiation detection. From simulations, the lens-coupled absorbers provide a 70% lens aperture efficiency in both polarizations over an octave band with a spiral array absorber and over 10% relative bandwidth with a single spiral. We have fabricated and measured two devices with bare Ti/Al MKIDs: a 3x3 cm chip with 9 pixels to characterize the optical response at 85 GHz of the two variations of the absorber; and a large format demonstrator with 253 spiral-array pixels showing potential towards a large format millimeter-wavelength camera. We estimate a sensitivity of 1 $\mathrm{mK}\cdot\mathrm{Hz}^{-0.5}$ and a 95% detector yield.</description>

      <title>Measuring the buried interphase between solid electrolytes and lithium metal using neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.</description>
