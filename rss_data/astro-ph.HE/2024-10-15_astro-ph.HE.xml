      <title>Gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae from the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first seconds-long multidimensional general relativistic neutrino magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) in rapidly rotating, magnetized white dwarfs (WDs). Our findings show that, with sufficiently strong initial magnetic fields and rotation, these systems can generate relativistic jets and neutron-rich outflows with properties consistent with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) accompanied by kilonovae, such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230703A. Notably, our models reproduce the power and duration of these LGRBs and the associated kilonovae without the need for tuning parameters. Additionally, our results suggest that the AIC of WDs could be an important site of the production for heavy $r$-process elements.</description>

      <title>Dual Jet Interaction, Magnetically Arrested Flows, and Flares in Accreting Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes in galactic centers are potential multimessenger sources in gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation. To find such objects, isolating unique electromagnetic signatures of their accretion flow is key. With the aid of three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that utilize an approximate, semi-analytic, super-imposed spacetime metric, we identify two such signatures for merging binaries. Both involve magnetic reconnection and are analogous to plasma processes observed in the solar corona. The first, like colliding flux tubes that can cause solar flares, involves colliding jets that form an extended reconnection layer, dissipating magnetic energy and causing the two jets to merge. The second, akin to coronal mass ejection events, involves the accretion of magnetic field lines onto both black holes; these magnetic fields then twist, inflate, and form a trailing current sheet, ultimately reconnecting and driving a hot outflow. We provide estimates for the associated electromagnetic emission for both processes, showing that they likely accelerate electrons to high energies and are promising candidates for continuous, stochastic, and/or quasi-periodic higher energy electromagnetic emission. We also show that the accretion flows around each black hole can display features associated with the magnetically arrested state. However, simulations with black hole spins misaligned with the orbital plane and simulations with larger Bondi radii saturate at lower values of horizon-penetrating magnetic flux than standard magnetically arrested disks, leading to weaker, intermittent jets due to feedback from the weak jets or equatorial flux tubes ejected by reconnecting field lines near the horizon.</description>

      <title>Measuring Black Hole Light Echoes with Very Long Baseline Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light passing near a black hole can follow multiple paths from an emission source to an observer due to strong gravitational lensing. Photons following different paths take different amounts of time to reach the observer, which produces an echo signature in the image. The characteristic echo delay is determined primarily by the mass of the black hole, but it is also influenced by the black hole spin and inclination to the observer. In the Kerr geometry, echo images are demagnified, rotated, and sheared copies of the direct image and lie within a restricted region of the image. Echo images have exponentially suppressed flux, and temporal correlations within the flow make it challenging to directly detect light echoes from the total light curve. In this paper, we propose a novel method to search for light echoes by correlating the total light curve with the interferometric signal at high spatial frequencies, which is a proxy for indirect emission. We explore the viability of our method using numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a near-face-on accretion system scaled to M87-like parameters. We demonstrate that our method can be used to directly infer the echo delay period in simulated data. An echo detection would be clear evidence that we have captured photons that have circled the black hole, and a high-fidelity echo measurement would provide an independent measure of fundamental black hole parameters. Our results suggest that detecting echoes may be achievable through interferometric observations with a modest space-based very long baseline interferometry mission.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the catalog pulsars dominating the Galactic positron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic-ray flux of positrons is measured with high precision by the space-borne particle spectrometer AMS-02. The hypothesis that pulsars and their nebulae can significantly contribute to the excess of the AMS-02 positron flux has been consolidated after the observation of a $\gamma$-ray emission at GeV and TeV energies of a few degree size around a few sources, that provide indirect evidence that electron and positron pairs are accelerated to very high energies from these sources. By modeling the emission from pulsars in the ATNF catalog, we find that combinations of positron emission from cataloged pulsars and secondary production can fit the observed AMS-02 data. Our results show that a small number of nearby, middle-aged pulsars, particularly B1055-52, Geminga (J0633+1746), and Monogem (B0656+14), dominate the positron emission, contributing up to 80\% of the flux at energies above 100 GeV. From the fit to the data, we obtain a list of the most important sources for which we recommend multi-wavelength follow-up observations, particularly in the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, to further constrain the injection and diffusion properties of positrons.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for rapid transients in the Subaru HSC-SSP transient survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-cadence transient surveys have discovered rapid transients whose light curve timescales are shorter than those of typical supernovae. In this paper, we present a systematic search for rapid transients at medium-high redshifts among 3381 supernova candidates obtained from the Subaru HSC-SSP transient survey. We developed a machine learning classifier to classify the supernova candidates into four types (Type Ia, Ibc, II supernovae, and rapid transients) based on the features derived from the light curves. By applying this classifier to the 3381 supernova candidates and by further applying the quality cut, we selected 14 rapid transient samples. They are located at a wide range of redshifts ($0.34 \leq z \leq 1.85$) and show a wide range of the peak absolute magnitude ($-17 \geq M \geq -22$). The event rate of the rapid transients is estimated to be $\sim 6\times10^3~\rm{events~yr^{-1}~Gpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 0.74$, which corresponds to about $2$ $\%$ of the event rate of normal core-collapse supernovae at the similar redshift. Based on the luminosity and color evolution, we selected two candidates of Type Ibn supernovae at $z\sim0.75$. The event rate of Type Ibn SN candidates is more than 1 $\%$ of Type Ib SN rate at the same redshift, suggesting that this fraction of massive stars at this redshift range eruptively ejects their He-rich envelope just before the explosions. Also, two objects at $z=1.37$ and 1.85 show high luminosities comparable to superluminous supernovae. Their event rate is about 10-25 $\%$ of superluminous supernovae at $z\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>Jet from binary neutron star merger with prompt black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed the longest numerical-relativity neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation for a binary neutron star merger that extends to $\approx1.5\mathrm{\,s}$ after the merger. We consider the binary model that undergoes the prompt collapse to a black hole after the merger with asymmetric mass 1.25$\,M_{\odot}$ and 1.65$\,M_{\odot}$ and SFHo equation of state. We find the Poynting flux-driven collimated outflow as well as the gravitational wave emission, neutrino emission, dynamical mass ejection, and post-merger mass ejection facilitated by magnetorotational instability-driven turbulent viscosity in a single self-consistent binary neutron star merger simulation. A magnetosphere dominated by the aligned global magnetic field penetrating the black hole develops along the black-hole spin axis after the turbulence in the remnant disk is enhanced. A jet with the Poynting flux with isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\sim10^{49}\mathrm{\,erg/s}$ is launched, and the duration of the high luminosity is expected to be $O(1)\mathrm{\,s}$.</description>

      <title>Imprints of M87 Jet Precession on the Black Hole-Accretion Disk System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational constraints on the configuration of the black hole (BH)-accretion disk-jet system are crucial for addressing key questions in black hole growth, accretion disk physics, and jet formation. The recently reported jet precession in M87 provides a novel avenue to explore these long-standing issues. This precession, attributed to the accretion disk's response to the frame-dragging effect of a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), indicates a non-zero spin. The relatively short precession period ($\sim$11 years) implies a compact accretion disk. In contrast to the traditional view of a strictly collimated shape, the M87 jet is inferred to curve at the innermost regions connecting to the spinning BH, which explains the unexpectedly wide innermost projected jet width.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulations around Accreting Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravity in the immediate vicinity of compact objects (e.g., black holes, neutron stars) necessitates inclusion of general relativistic effects. Traditionally, pseudo-Newtonian potential representation of gravity were favored to simulate the fluid motion in this region since that reduced the calculation complexity. However, with the advent of easily implementable, reliable numerical algorithms and computer hardware, more and more research groups are shifting towards the numerical solutions of general relativistic fluid dynamics equations. In this work, we report our progress on the development of such simulation tool and present results of sub-Keplerian accretion flow onto black holes.</description>

      <title>Identification and modelling of optically thin inverse Compton scattering in the prompt emission of GRB131014A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism responsible for the prompt gamma-ray emission of a gamma-ray burst continues to remain an enigma. The detailed analysis of the spectrum of GRB 131014A observed by the $Fermi$ gamma ray burst monitor and Large Area Telescope has revealed an unconventional spectral shape that significantly deviates from the typical Band function. The spectrum exhibits three distinctive breaks and an extended power law at higher energies. Furthermore, the lower end of the spectrum aligns with power-law indices greater than -0.5, and in the brightest region of the burst, these values approach +1. The lowest spectral break is thereby found to be consistent with a blackbody. These observed spectral characteristics strongly suggest the radiation process to be inverse Compton scattering in an optically thin region. Applying the empirical fit parameters for physical modeling, we find that the kinetic energy of the GRB jet of bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma \sim 400$, gets dissipated just above the photosphere, approximately at a radius of $\sim 10^{14}$ cm. The electrons involved in this process are accelerated to a power-law index of $\delta = -1.5$, and the minimum electron Lorentz factor, $\gamma_{min}$, is approximately $3$. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive identification and detailed modeling of optically thin inverse Compton scattering in the prompt emission of GRB 131014A.</description>

      <title>Compact object populations over cosmic time I. BOSSA: a Binary Object environment-Sensitive Sampling Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis (BPS) is an essential tool for extracting information about massive binary evolution from gravitational-wave (GW) detections of compact object mergers. It has been successfully used to constrain the most likely permutations of evolution models among hundreds of alternatives, while initial condition models, in contrast, have not yet received the same level of attention. Here, we introduce BOSSA, a detailed initial sampling code including a set of 192 initial condition permutations for BPS that capture both "invariant" and "varying" models, the latter accounting for a possible metallicity- and star formation rate (SFR)-dependence of the initial mass function (IMF); as well as correlations between the initial primary mass, orbital period, mass ratio and eccentricity of binaries. We include 24 metallicity-specific cosmic star formation history (cSFH) models and propose two alternate models for the mass-dependent binary fraction. We build a detailed pipeline for time-evolving BPS, such that each binary has well-defined initial conditions, and we are able to distinguish the contributions from populations of different ages. We discuss the meaning of the IMF for binaries and introduce a refined initial sampling procedure for component masses. We also discuss the treatment of higher-order multiple systems when normalizing a binary sample. In particular, we argue for how a consistent interpretation of the IMF implies that this is not the distribution from which any set of component masses should be independently drawn, and show how the individual IMF of primaries and companions is expected to deviate from the full IMF.</description>

      <title>Expansion properties of the young supernova type Iax remnant Pa 30 revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered Pa 30 nebula, the putative type Iax supernova remnant associated with the historical supernova of 1181 AD, shows puzzling characteristics that make it unique among known supernova remnants. In particular, Pa 30 exhibits a complex morphology, with a unique radial and filamentary structure, and it hosts a hot stellar remnant at its center, which displays oxygen-dominated, ultra-fast winds. Because of the surviving stellar remnant and the lack of hydrogen and helium in its filaments, it has been suggested that Pa 30 is the product of a failed thermonuclear explosion in a near- or super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, which created a sub-luminous transient, a rare sub-type of the Ia class of supernovae called type Iax. We here present a detailed study of the 3D structure and velocities of a full radial section of the remnant. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations, obtained with the new red channel of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectrograph, reveal that the ejecta are consistent with being ballistic, with velocities close to the free-expansion velocity. Additionally, we detect a large cavity inside the supernova remnant and a sharp inner edge to the filamentary structure, which coincides with the outer edge of a bright ring detected in infrared images. Finally, we detect a strong asymmetry in the amount of ejecta along the line of sight, which might hint to an asymmetric explosion. Our analysis provides strong confirmation that the explosion originated from SN 1181.</description>

      <title>From Supernovae to Neutron Stars: A Systematic Approach to Axion Production at Finite Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of QCD axion production in environments with finite baryon density and temperature, implying significant changes to axion phenomenology. Within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, we derive the effective Lagrangian describing axion interactions with nucleons and mesons up to next-to-leading-order in the chiral expansion. We focus on corrections to the axion-nucleon couplings from higher orders and finite density. These couplings are modified by up to an order of magnitude near nuclear saturation density, significantly impacting axion production in supernovae and neutron stars. Density-dependent corrections enhance the axion luminosity in supernovae by an order of magnitude, strengthening current best bounds by a factor of three. We stress the importance of including all axion production channels up to a given chiral order for a consistent luminosity calculation and classify the missing contributions up to the third chiral order. The modified axion-nucleon couplings also affect neutron star cooling rates via axion emission. A re-evaluation of existing neutron star cooling bounds, constrained to regions where perturbative control is reliable, weakens these bounds by a factor of four. Lastly, our results have implications for terrestrial axion searches that rely on precise knowledge of axion-nucleon couplings.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that all static Love number couplings of operators involving only parity-even fields vanish to all orders, a conclusion that holds even for non-axisymmetric configurations. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

Abstract: The fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting central, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low redshifts is an important observational probe of black hole seeding at high redshift. Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for non-detections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances $&lt;50$ Mpc, radio data from the VLA Sky Survey at $&lt; 50$ Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at $z&lt;0.055$. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least $90$ percent at stellar masses of $M_{\star}=10^8~M_{\odot}$ and at least $39$ percent at $M_{\star} = 10^7~M_{\odot}$ (95\% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low luminosity end ($L_{\rm{bol}}\lesssim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the AGN luminosity functions at $z=0$. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work.</description>

      <title>Advection-nonlinear-diffusion model of flare accelerated electron transport in Type III solar radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons accelerated by solar flares and observed as type III solar radio bursts are not only a crucial diagnostic tool for understanding electron transport in the inner heliosphere but also a possible early indication of potentially hazardous space weather events. The electron beams travelling in the solar corona and heliosphere along magnetic field lines generate Langmuir waves and quasilinearly relax towards a plateau in velocity space. The relaxation of the electron beam over the short distance in contrast to large beam-travel distances observed is often referred to as Sturrok's dilemma. Here, we develop a new electron transport model with quasilinear distance/time self-consistently changing in space and time. The model results in a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the electron beam density with nonlinear diffusion term that inversely proportional to the beam density. The solution predicts slow super-diffusive (ballistic) spatial expansion of a fast propagating electron beam. The model also provides the evolution of the spectral energy density of Langmuir waves, which determines brightness temperature of plasma radiation in solar bursts. The model solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulation using kinetic equations and can explain some characteristics of type III solar radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino-Majoron couplings using SN1987A data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or of neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Protostar-Driven Photoionization in Herbig-Haro Jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies showed that observations of line emission from shocks in YSO jets require a substantial amount of ionization of the pre-shock matter. Photoionization from X-ray emitted close to the central source may be responsible for the initial ionization fraction. The aim of our work is to study the effect of X-ray photoionization, coming from the vicinity of the central star, on the ionization fraction inside the jet that can be advected at large distances. For this purpose we have performed axisymmetric MHD jet launching simulations including photoionization and optically thin losses using PLUTO. For typical X-ray luminosities in classical T-Tauri stars, we see that the photoionization is responsible for ionizing to 10 % -20 % the jet close to the star.</description>

      <title>Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars: Impacts of Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars have been well studied since they may be relevant to the physical interpretation of some of the observed quasiperiodic oscillations in the magnetar giant flares. In the crustal region of a magnetar, the strong magnetic field can alter the equation of state and composition due to the Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion. In this paper, we study this effect on the crust-confined, torsional oscillation modes of neutron stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic fields in general relativity under the Cowling approximation. Furthermore, the inner and outer crusts are treated consistently based on the nuclear-energy density functional theory. Depending on the magnetic-field configurations, we find that the Landau-Rabi quantization of electrons can change the frequencies of the fundamental torsional oscillation mode of $1.4 M_\odot$ neutron star models with a normal fluid core by about 10% when the magnetic field strength at the pole reaches the order of $10^{16}$ G. The shift can even approach 20% at a field strength of $10^{15}$ G for neutron stars with a simple model of superconducting core where the magnetic field is assumed to be expelled completely.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes: Development of a minimal model for pulsar glitches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore the coupled motion of neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes in a gravitationally collapsed condensate, which describe neutron stars that form pulsars. Our framework uses the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson-Equation (GPPE) for neutron Cooper pairs, the Real-Time-Ginzburg-Landau equation (RTGLE) for proton Cooper pairs, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and Newtonian gravity and interactions, both direct and induced by the Poisson equation, between the neutron and proton subsystems. For a pulsar we include a crust potential, characterized by an angle $\theta$, and frictional drag. By carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations, we obtain a variety of interesting results. We show that a rotating proton superconductor generates a uniform London magnetic field, which changes the field distribution inside flux tubes. In the absence of any direct interaction between the two species, they interact through the gravitational Poisson equation. The presence of attractive (repulsive) density-density interaction leads to the attraction (repulsion) between neutron vortices and proton flux tubes. The inclusion of the current-current interaction and the complete Maxwell equations allows us to quantify the entrainment effect that leads to induced magnetization of neutron vortices. We show that, with a strong external magnetic field ${\bf B}_{\rm ext}$, proton flux tubes are anchored to the crust, whereas neutron vortices leave the condensate and lead to abrupt changes of the crust angular momentum ${\rm J}_c$. The frictional term in the dynamical equation for $\theta$ yields stick-slip dynamics that leads, in turn, to glitches in the time series of ${\rm J}_c$. By calculating various statistical properties of this time series, we demonstrate that they display self-organised criticality(SOC).</description>

      <title>Expected insights on type Ia supernovae from LISA's gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae has long been debated, primarily due to the elusiveness of the progenitor systems to traditional electromagnetic observation methods. We argue that gravitational wave observations with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) offer the most promising way to test one of the leading progenitor scenarios - the double-degenerate scenario, which involves a binary system of two white dwarf stars. In this study we review published results, supplementing them with additional calculations for the context of Type Ia supernovae. We discuss the fact that LISA will be able to provide a complete sample of double white dwarf Type Ia supernova progenitors with orbital periods shorter than 16-11 minutes (gravitational wave frequencies above 2-3 millihertz). Such a sample will enable a statistical validation of the double-degenerate scenario by simply counting whether LISA detects enough double white dwarf binaries to account for the measured Type Ia merger rate in Milky Way-like galaxies. Additionally, we illustrate how LISA's capability to measure the chirp mass will set lower bounds on the primary mass, revealing whether detected double white dwarf binaries will eventually end up as a Type Ia supernova. We estimate that the expected LISA constraints on the Type Ia merger rate for the Milky Way will be 4-9%. We also discuss the potential gravitational wave signal from a Type Ia supernova assuming a double-detonation mechanism and explore how multi-messenger observations could significantly advance our understanding of these transient phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the uncertainty of the White Dwarf Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) is a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal that is emitted by different populations of inspiralling binary systems containing compact objects throughout the Universe. In the frequency range between 0.1 and 100 mHz it will be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Recently, we concluded that the white dwarf (WD) contribution to the AGWB dominates over that of black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs).
  Aims: We aim to investigate the uncertainties of the WD AGWB that arise from the use of different stellar metallicities, different star formation rate density (SFRD) models, and different binary evolution models.
  Methods: We use the code developed before to determine the WD component of the AGWB. We use a metallicity dependent SFRD based on earlier work to construct five different SFRD models. We use four different population models that use different common-envelope treatment and six different metallicities for each model.
  Results: For all possible combinations, the WD component of the AGWB is dominant over other populations of compact objects. The effects of metallicity and population model are smaller than the effect of a (metallicity dependent) SFRD model. We find a range of about a factor of 5 in the level of the WD AGWB around a mid value of $\Omega_{\rm WD} = 4\times10^{-12}$ at 1 mHz and a shape that depends weakly on the model.
  Conclusions: We find an uncertainty for the WD component of the AGWB of about a factor 5. We note that there exist other uncertainties that have an effect on this signal as well. We discuss whether the turnover of the WD AGWB at 10 mHz will be detectable by LISA, and find that this is likely. We confirm the previous finding that the WD component of the AGWB dominates over other populations, in particular BHs.</description>

      <title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semi-analytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of $\sim 10^7$-$10^8~L_\odot$ in optical and UV, and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the open source code PHOEBUS (phifty one ergs blows up a star) for astrophysical general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations. PHOEBUS is designed for, but not limited to, high energy astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, black-hole accretion disks, and similar phenomena. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics are modeled in the Valencia formulation with conservative finite volume methods. Neutrino radiation transport is included with Monte Carlo and moment methods. PHOEBUS is built on the PARTHENON (Grete et al. 2022) performance portable adaptive mesh refinement framework, uses a GPU first development strategy, and is capable of modeling a large dynamic range in space and time. PHOEBUS utilizes KOKKOS for on-node parallelism and supports both CPU and GPU architectures. We describe the physical model employed in PHOEBUS, the numerical methods used, and demonstrate a suite of test problems to showcase its abilities. We demonstrate weak scaling to over 500 H100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use the MIST stellar models and our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $5.6 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 20 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitor binary stars do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\lesssim$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $\sim 4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$ (for our fiducial model), representing $\sim 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\approx 4000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\approx 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3-like. Given the density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Our models show that, even if it was born inside a stellar cluster, Gaia BH3 is compatible with a primordial binary star that escaped from its parent cluster without experiencing significant dynamical interactions.</description>
