      <title>Uncertainty quantification for $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei: charge distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei for a given set of effective operators mediating the violation of lepton flavor symmetry crucially depends on hadronic and nuclear matrix elements. In particular, the uncertainties inherent in this non-perturbative input limit the discriminating power that can be achieved among operators by studying different target isotopes. In order to quantify the associated uncertainties, as a first step, we go back to nuclear charge densities and propagate the uncertainties from electron scattering data for a range of isotopes relevant for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, including $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{48,50}$Ti, and $^{27}$Al. We provide as central results Fourier-Bessel expansions of the corresponding charge distributions with complete covariance matrices, accounting for Coulomb-distortion effects in a self-consistent manner throughout the calculation. As an application, we evaluate the overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion mediated by dipole operators. In combination with modern ab-initio methods, our results will allow for the evaluation of general $\mu\to e$ conversion rates with quantified uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Relativistic Hartree-Fock model with spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06845v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes the time-dependent relativistic Hartree-Fock (TD-RHF) model with spherical symmetry for the first time. The time-dependent integro-differential Dirac equations are solved by expanding Dirac spinors on the spherical Dirac Woods-Saxon (DWS) basis. The numerical verification demonstrates the high conservation qualities for both the total binding energy and the particle number, as well as the time-reversal invariance of the system, which ensures the precision and reliability of the newly developed TD-RHF model. Subsequently, the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) mode of $^{208}$Pb is investigated using the RHF Lagrangian PKO1. The constrained energy of the ISGMR calculated by PKO1 is found to be in close agreement with the experimental data, and the strength function is similar to the results given by the relativistic Hartree-Fock plus random phase approximation. Based on the advantage of the TD-RHF model in avoiding complicated calculations of the residual interactions, the ISGMR mode of $^{208}$Pb is calculated by twelve relativistic effective Lagrangians. The results indicate that the value of the incompressibility of nuclear matter $K_\infty$ constrained by relativistic effective Lagrangians is in the range of $237\sim246$ MeV, which is lower than the previous investigations based on the relativistic models.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Hartree-Fock model for axial-symmetric nuclei with quadruple and octupole deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Background:} The initial observation of a negative-parity state in proximity to the ground state in the 1950s marked the advent of extensive research into octupole deformed nuclei. Since then, the physics of octupole deformed nuclei has consistently held a special interest within the field of nuclear physics. In the present era, with the advent of sophisticated radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities and advanced detectors, coupled with the remarkable capabilities of high-performance computing, extensive and intensive explorations are being conducted from both experimental and theoretical perspectives to elucidate the physics of octupole deformed nuclei. \textbf{Results:} This work establishes the OD-RHF model, which provides a reliable tool for studying octupole nuclei over a fairly wide range. The reliability of the newly developed OD-RHF model is illustrated by taking the octupole nucleus $^{144}$Ba as an example. Furthermore, the octupole deformation effects in $^{144}$Ba is verified by using the RHF Lagrangians PKO$i$ ($i=1,2,3$) and the RMF one DD-ME2. The intrusion of the neutron $1i_{13/2}$ and proton $1h_{11/2}$ components is demonstrated to play an essential role in determining the notable octupole deformation of $^{144}$Ba using PKO$i$ ($i=1,2,3$) and DD-ME2. It is indicated that the Fock terms play an important role in stabilizing the octupole deformation. More specifically, due to the repulsive tensor coupling between the intrude components and the core of $^{144}$Ba, the tensor force component carried by the $\pi$-PV coupling, that contributes only via the Fock terms, plays an opposing role in the formation of the octupole deformation of $^{144}$Ba.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of nuclear incompressibility from proton elliptic flow in central Au+Au collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompressibility $K$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) is inferred in a Bayesian analysis of proton elliptic flow in mid-central Au + Au collisions at $E = 400$ MeV/nucleon using a Gaussian process (GP) emulator of the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model for heavy-ion collisions, with or without considering the momentum dependence of single-nucleon potentials. Consistent but with smaller quantified uncertainties than previous results from forward modeling of the collective flow in heavy-ion collisions using IQMD, considering the momentum dependence of nucleon potentials, $K=191.3^{+3.7}_{-6.3}$ MeV at 68\% confidence level, indicating a very soft SNM equation of state, is inferred from the combined data of the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the proton elliptic flow in the Au+Au collisions considered. Ignoring the momentum dependence of single-nucleon potentials, the extracted value for $K$ is $234.7^{+14.6}_{-11.4}$ MeV, in agreement with its fiducial value derived from giant resonance studies.</description>

      <title>Superscaling analysis of inclusive electron and (anti)neutrino scattering within the coherent density fluctuation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental data from quasielastic electron and (anti)neutrino scattering on $^{12}$C are reanalyzed in terms of a new scaling variable $\psi^*$ suggested by the interacting relativistic Fermi gas with scalar and vector interactions, which is known to generate a relativistic effective mass for the interacting nucleons. We construct a new scaling function $f^\text{QE}(\psi^*)$ for the inclusive lepton scattering from nuclei within the coherent density fluctuation model (CDFM). The latter is a natural extension of the relativistic Fermi gas model to finite nuclei. In this work, on the basis of the scaling function obtained within CDFM with a relativistic effective mass $m_N^* =0.8 m_N$, we calculate and compare the theoretical predictions with a large set of experimental data for inclusive ($e,e'$) and (anti)neutrino cross sections. The model also includes the contribution of weak two-body currents in the two-particle two-hole sector, evaluated within a fully relativistic Fermi gas. Good agreement with experimental data is found over the whole range of electron and (anti)neutrino energies.</description>

      <title>Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the formation of twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin stars-two stable neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii have long been proposed to appear as a consequence of a possible first-order phase transition in NS matter. Within a meta-model for the EOS of hybrid stars, we revisit the viability of twin stars and its dependence on numerous parameters characterizing the EOS of nuclear matter, quark matter, and the phase transition between them. While essentially no experimental constraint exists for the last two, parameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter have been constrained within various ranges by terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Within these ranges, the impact of nuclear EOS on the formation of twin stars is studied. It is found that the symmetry energy of neutron-rich nucleonic matter notably influences the formation of twin stars, particularly through its slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$. Conversely, the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter shows minimal influence on the formation of twin stars, partially owing to its relatively well-constrained parameters.</description>

      <title>Helium-4 gravitational form factors: exchange currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the leading exchange corrections to the Helium-4 gravitational form factors (GFFs) upto momenta of the order of the nucleon mass. We use both the K-harmonic method with simple pair nucleon potential, and a Jastrow trial function using the Argonne $v_{14}$ potential, to evaluate the Helium-4 GFFs. The exchange current contributions include the pair interaction, plus the seagull and the pion exchange interactions, modulo the recoil corrections. To estimate the off-shellness of the pion nucleon coupling in this momenta range, we discuss the results using either the pseudo-scalar (PS) or pseudo-vector (PV) pion-nucleon couplings. When the PV coupling is used, the pair diagram contribution is higher order in the non relativistic expansion. The results for the Helium-4 A-GFF are comparable to those given by the impulse approximation, especially for the PS coupling using both the K-Harmonic method and variational method. The exchange current contributions with the PS coupling for the charge form factor of Helium-4, yield better agreement with the existing data over a broad range of momenta, especially when the Argonne $v_{14}$ potential including the D-wave admixture is used.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Hedin's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedin's equations provide an elegant route to compute the exact one-body Green's function (or propagator) via the self-consistent iteration of a set of non-linear equations.
  Its first-order approximation, known as $GW$, corresponds to a resummation of ring diagrams and has shown to be extremely successful in physics and chemistry. Systematic improvement is possible, although challenging, via the introduction of vertex corrections.
  Considering anomalous propagators and an external pairing potential, we derive a new self-consistent set of closed equations equivalent to the famous Hedin equations but having as a first-order approximation the particle-particle (pp) $T$-matrix approximation where one performs a resummation of the ladder diagrams.
  This pp version of Hedin's equations offers a way to go systematically beyond the $T$-matrix approximation by accounting for low-order pp vertex corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several topics concerning nuclear structure and electromagnetic interactions of heavy nuclei are reviewed. These comprehend the deformed single-particle shell model, nuclear collective motion, symmetry breaking and approximate symmetry restoring in atomic nuclei, particularly the proxy-SU(3) scheme. The relations between these theoretical frameworks are stated and it is shown how they contribute to a better and broader understanding of atomic nuclei. The semi-microscopic algebraic quartet model of atomic nuclei in the proxy-SU(3) scheme is applied to obtain previously unknown irreducible representations, deformation parameters, nuclear excited states and electromagnetic transition probabilities for certain heavy isotopes. The experimental data available for such nuclear region is currently very poor, so in preparation for future experimental efforts the theoretical background is developed along with some perspectives to work on are proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of two-body currents on magnetic dipole moments of medium-mass and heavy nuclei using the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group with chiral effective field theory interactions and currents. Focusing on near doubly magic nuclei from oxygen to bismuth, we have found that the leading two-body currents globally improve the agreement with experimental magnetic moments. Moreover, our results show the importance of multi-shell effects for $^{41}$Ca, which suggest that the $Z=N=20$ gap in $^{40}$Ca is not as robust as in $^{48}$Ca. The increasing contribution of two-body currents in heavier systems is explained by the operator structure of the center-of-mass dependent Sachs term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict neutron-proton scattering cross-sections and polarization observables up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order in a renormalization-group invariant description of the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction. Low-energy constants are calibrated to phase shifts, sub-leading corrections are computed in distorted-wave perturbation theory, and we employ momentum-cutoff values 500 and 2500 MeV. We find a steady order-by-order convergence and realistic descriptions of scattering observables up to a laboratory scattering energy of approximately 100 MeV. We also compare perturbative and non-perturbative calculations for phase shifts and cross sections and quantify how unitarity is gradually restored at higher orders. The perturbative approach offers an important diagnostic tool for any power counting and our results suggest that the breakdown scale in chiral effective field theory might be significantly lower than estimates obtained in non-perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Muon Capture on $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O from $Ab~Initio$ Nuclear Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon capture on nuclei is one of the most promising probes of the nuclear electroweak current driving the yet-hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Both processes involve vector and axial-vector currents at finite momentum transfer, $q\sim 100$ MeV, as well as the induced pseudoscalar and weak-magnetism currents. Comparing measured muon-capture rates with reliable $ab~initio$ nuclear-theory predictions could help us validate these currents. To this end, we compute partial muon-capture rates for $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, feeding the ground and excited states in $^{6}$He, $^{12}$B and $^{16}$N, using $ab~initio$ no-core shell model with two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions. We remove the spurious center-of-mass motion by introducing translationally invariant operators and approximate the effect of hadronic two-body currents by Fermi-gas model. We solve the bound-muon wave function from the Dirac wave equations in the Coulomb field created by a finite nucleus. We find that the computed rates to the low-lying states in the final nuclei are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. We highlight sensitivity of some of the transitions to the sub-leading three-nucleon interaction terms. We also compare summed rates to several tens of final states with the measured total capture rates and note that we slightly underestimate the total rate with this simple approach due to limited range of excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of heavy flavour in a weakly magnetized hot QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients ($D_s$ and $\kappa$), and the collisional energy loss ($dE/dx$) of a heavy quark (HQ) traversing through a thermal medium of quarks and gluons in a weak magnetic field ($B$), for the two cases of the HQ moving either parallel or perpendicular to $\bm{B}$. For that purpose, we consider Coulomb scatterings ($t$-channel) of the HQ with the light quarks, obtained from the imaginary part of the HQ self-energy via the cutting rules. Both the normalised (by $T^3$) %\textit{momentum} diffusion coefficients, $\kappa$, as well as $dE/dx$, for charm quarks are larger than that for bottom quarks due to the larger mass of the latter. Also, the effect of $B$ is more feeble on the bottom quark, compared to the charm quark. Comparatively, the magnitudes of both $\kappa$ and $dE/dx$ are significantly smaller for the case of $\bm{v}\perp\bm{B}$. For both the cases, our results show that the momentum transfer between the HQ and the medium takes place preferentially along the direction of HQ velocity, thus leading to a significant increase in the momentum diffusion anisotropy, compared to $B=0$. We also calculate the (scaled) spatial diffusion coefficient, which we find to be independent of the heavy flavor mass and is almost unaffected by changes in $B$.</description>

The initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple error-mitigation strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing 13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product State simulations. Prospects for a near-term quantum advantage in simulations of hadron scattering are discussed.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling and mass distributions</title>

Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated neutron stars, employing different nuclear equations of state with or without active direct Urca process, and investigate the interplay with the nuclear pairing gaps. We find that a consistent description of all current cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps, but no neutron 3P2 pairing. We then deduce the neutron star mass distributions compatible with the cooling analysis and compare with current theoretical models. Reduced 1S0 gaps and unimodal mass distributions are preferred by the analysis. The importance of statistical and systematic errors is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Quark anomalous magnetic moment in an extreme magnetic background from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop QCD correction to the photon-quark-antiquark vertex in an extremely strong magnetic background, i.e., one in which $\sqrt{eB}$ is much larger than all other mass scales. We resort to the lowest-Landau level approximation, and consider on shell fermions. We find that the total magnetic moment is such that the anomalous magnetic moment contributes to the electric part $\sim iE_3\sigma_3$, the other contributions to $\boldsymbol{B}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and $i\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}_\perp$ being completely suppressed. We show results for the anomalous magnetic moment of quarks up and down, scaled by their values in the vacuum, as a function of the external magnetic field, considering dressed gluons and a renormalization scale $\mu_\mathrm{\tiny \overline{ MS}}=\sqrt{|eB|}$.</description>

      <title>From pole parameters to line shapes and branching ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonances are uniquely characterized by their complex pole locations and the corresponding residues. In practice, however, resonances are typically identified experimentally as structures in invariant mass distributions, with branching fractions of resonances determined as ratios of count rates. To make contact between these quantities it is necessary to connect line shapes and resonance parameters. In this work we propose such a connection and illustrate the formalism with detailed studies of the $\rho(770)$ and $f_0(500)$ resonances. Based on the line shapes inferred from the resonance parameters along these lines, expressions for partial widths and branching ratios are derived and compared to other approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>A dynamical implementation of canonical second quantization on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop theoretical methods for the implementation of creation and destruction operators in separate registers of a quantum computer, allowing for a transparent and dynamical creation and destruction of particle modes in second quantization in problems with variable particle number. We establish theorems for the commutation (anticommutation) relations on a finite memory bank and provide the needed symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing operators. Finally, we provide formulae in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify $n$ particles with $N_p$ modes each is of order $n\log_2 N_p$. Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires $O(N_p)$ qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each). And although less efficient, it is also less cumbersome than compact encoding.</description>
