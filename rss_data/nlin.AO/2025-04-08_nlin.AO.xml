      <title>Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial integrability of the Kuramoto model is often thought to be restricted to identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the exact connectivity prerequisites for having constants of motion on more general graphs have remained elusive. Using spectral properties of the Koopman generator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of distinct constants of motion in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, signed graph. This reveals a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities. Furthermore, we identify Lie symmetries that generate new constants of motion. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks.</description>

      <title>How communities shape epidemic spreading: A hierarchically structured metapopulation perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05653</link>

Abstract: Recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, and influenza have renewed interest in advancing epidemic models to better reflect the complexities of disease spreading. Modern approaches incorporate social norms, mobility patterns, and heterogeneous community structures to capture the interplay between social and biological dynamics. This study examines epidemic propagation in hierarchically structured metapopulation networks, where individuals interact within localized communities -- such as schools, workplaces, and theaters -- and diffuse across them. Using mean-field averaging, we derive a scaling law linking contagion rates to the mean connectivity degree, while stability analysis identifies thresholds for infection surges. In networks with heterogeneous mean degrees, spectral perturbation theory reveals how structural variability accelerates and amplifies disease spreading. We find that nodes with above-average degrees are not only infected earlier but also act as key outbreak drivers. Framing epidemic dynamics as a continuous phase transition, we apply pattern formation theory to show that the critical eigenvectors governing system stability are shaped by the network's degree distribution. Crucially, by analyzing Laplacian eigenvector localization, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between community infection densities and the entries of the critical eigenvector -- revealing how internal community structure directly shapes global infection patterns. This work provides a systematic framework for understanding and predicting epidemic dynamics in structured populations, while highlighting the fundamental role of community organization.</description>

      <title>The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.</description>
