      <title>Improving Biomedical Knowledge Graph Quality: A Community Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used across research and translational settings, yet their design decisions and implementation are often opaque. Unlike ontologies that more frequently adhere to established creation principles, biomedical KGs lack consistent practices for construction, documentation, and dissemination. To address this gap, we introduce a set of evaluation criteria grounded in widely accepted data standards and principles from related fields. We apply these criteria to 16 biomedical KGs, revealing that even those that appear to align with best practices often obscure essential information required for external reuse. Moreover, biomedical KGs, despite pursuing similar goals and ingesting the same sources in some cases, display substantial variation in models, source integration, and terminology for node types. Reaping the potential benefits of knowledge graphs for biomedical research while reducing wasted effort requires community-wide adoption of shared criteria and maturation of standards such as BioLink and KGX. Such improvements in transparency and standardization are essential for creating long-term reusability, improving comparability across resources, and enhancing the overall utility of KGs within biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced ensemble GANs for anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.</description>
