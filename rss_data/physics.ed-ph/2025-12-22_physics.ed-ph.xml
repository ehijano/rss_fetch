      <title>Measuring fidelity of implementation of named active learning methods in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various active learning methods have been developed for introductory physics, and these methods are increasingly being adopted by instructors. However, instructors often do not implement these methods exactly as was originally intended by the developers, as they may face issues related to funding and institutional support for active learning and/or have different instructional contexts (e.g., student populations) and environments (e.g., physical classroom layouts) than the developers. Existing research does not sufficiently capture the range of variation in instructor implementation of established active learning methods, especially in comparison to high-fidelity implementations. In this study, we first identify the critical components (i.e., components without which the active learning method cannot be said to have been implemented) of three named active learning methods: SCALE-UP, ISLE, and Tutorials. We then evaluate the fidelity with which 18 different introductory physics instructors implement these methods by analyzing classroom observations and comparing the extent to which these broader implementations use each critical component in their classroom to high-fidelity implementations. We find across all three active learning methods that broader implementations spend similar amounts of class time on the critical components as high-fidelity implementations. At the same time, we observe substantial variation in the specific styles that broader implementers operationalize these critical components (e.g., doing a few long activities versus many short activities). Finally, we find no clear relationship between fidelity of implementation and student conceptual learning gains for our study's sample of instructors, providing preliminary evidence that different ways of implementing the critical components of active learning method may all effectively improve student understanding.</description>

      <title>Women in Theoretical Quantum Physics in Brazil:demographics, career profiles, recognition, and leadership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender imbalance in Physics remains a persistent global challenge, and Brazil is no exception. While women account for only 24% of Physics faculty in the country, their representation in Quantum Physics is even smaller. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive overview of women working in Theoretical Quantum Physics in Brazil, here referred to as the SheQ (She + Quantum) community. Using data from the CNPq Lattes platform, we identify 93 researchers and analyze their geographic distribution, academic trajectories, scientific productivity, international experience, recognition through awards and fellowships, and engagement with initiatives promoting gender equity. Our results reveal both progress and persistent disparities: SheQ researchers have a strong scientific output, leadership roles, and international training; yet, their recognition through productivity fellowships remains modest, and their involvement in gender-related initiatives, although increasing among younger generations, remains limited. By combining quantitative indicators with institutional perspectives, we highlight structural barriers as well as opportunities for fostering a more inclusive environment in Quantum Physics. his study thus contributes to a broader reflection on how diversity not only promotes fairness but also strengthens creativity, innovation, and scientific progress.</description>
