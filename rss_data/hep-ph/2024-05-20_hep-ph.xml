      <title>Vacuum structure of an eight-dimensional $SU(3)$ gauge theory on a magnetized torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum structure of an eight-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory with a compactified four-dimensional torus as the extra dimensions. As a non-trivial background configuration of the gauge field of an $SU(n)$ gauge group, we suppose a magnetic flux in two extra dimensions, and continuous Wilson line phases are also involved. We introduce matter fields and calculate the mass spectrum of low-energy modes appearing in a four-dimensional effective theory in an $SU(3)$ model as an explicit example. As expected, potentially tachyonic states in four-dimensional modes appear from extra-dimensional gauge fields that couple to the flux background since the gauge group is simply connected. The Wilson line phases give a non-vanishing contribution to their masses, and we have a low-energy mass spectrum without tachyonic states, given that these phases take an appropriate value. To verify the validity of the values of the Wilson line phases, we examine the one-loop effective potential for these phases and explicitly show the contribution from each type of field present in our model. It is clarified that, although there seems to be no local minimum in the potential for the Wilson line phases in the pure Yang-Mills case, by including matter fields, we could find a vacuum configuration where tachyonic states disappear. Hence, non-abelian gauge theory with flux background can be used to construct phenomenologically interesting theories beyond the standard model, such as gauge-Higgs unification and grand unified theories.</description>

      <title>Study on the electromagnetic properties of the $[sc] [\bar q \bar b]$ and $[sc] [\bar s \bar b]$ states with $J^P = 1^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is conducted to elucidate their nature, which continues to be the subject of controversy and incomplete understanding in the field. In this study, the magnetic dipole and quadrupole moments of the tetraquarks $[sc] [\bar q \bar b]$ and $[sc] [\bar s \bar b]$ with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$ are extracted in the context of a compact diquark-antidiquark configuration with the help of the QCD sum rules method. The magnetic dipole moments are given as $\mu_{[sc] [\bar u \bar b]} = -2.12^{+0.74}_{-0.59} \mu_N$, $\mu_{[sc] [\bar d \bar b]} = 1.66^{+0.60}_{-0.46} \mu_N$, and $\mu_{[sc] [\bar s \bar b]} = 2.01^{+0.61}_{-0.50} \mu_N$. The order of magnitude of the magnetic dipole moments would suggest that these outcomes may be achievable in forthcoming experiments. The magnetic and quadrupole moments of hadrons represent another important observable, along with their mass and decay width, which contribute to our understanding of the underlying quark structure and dynamics. Therefore, we hope that the results of this study will prove useful in theoretical and experimental investigations, which we anticipate will be an interesting research topic.</description>

      <title>Does SuperKamiokande Observe Levy Flights of Solar Neutrinos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper utilizes data from the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino detection experiment and analyses them by diffusion entropy analysis and standard deviation analysis. The result indicates that solar neutrinos are subject to Levy flights (anomalous diffusion, superdiffusion). Subsequently, the paper derives the probability density function, represented as Fox H-function, and the governing fractional diffusion equation (fractional Fokker-Planck Equation) for solar neutrino Levy flights.</description>

      <title>The role of triangle singularity in isospin breaking process $J/\psi \to \Lambda \bar{\Lambda} \pi$ and the possible evidence of $\Sigma^*(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the impact of triangle singularity is investigated in the isospin-breaking process $J/\psi \to \Lambda \bar{\Lambda} \pi$. The triangle singularity is found to play a significant role in the process, resulting in the creation of a resonance-like structure around 1.4 GeV in the $\Lambda\pi(\bar{\Lambda}\pi)$ invariant mass spectrum. To amplify the impact of this triangle singularity, the presence of two $\Sigma^*(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ states around 1.4 GeV and 1.6 GeV is essential, yet these states have not been definitively identified in the current baryon spectrum. We recommend that experiments, particularly the Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII) and the future Super Tau-Charm Factory (STCF), to investigate the process $J/\psi \to \Lambda \bar{\Lambda} \pi$ to offer direct evidences for our predicted triangle singularity and additional evidence regarding the $\Sigma(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ states.</description>

      <title>Theory of CP angles measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early 80's Sanda-san and collaborators wrote key papers on the direct and clean determination of the unitarity angle $\phi_1$ ($\beta$). This motivated many of us for analogously coming up with ways for direct and clean determinations of the other two unitarity angles, $\phi_2 (\alpha)$ and $\phi_3 (\gamma)$. Current status of these direct determinations as well as our expectations for when Belle-II has 50 $ab^{-1}$ of luminosity and LHCb with some upgrades, will be given. In particular, it is emphasized that for direct determination of $\phi_3$, Belle-II should be able to handle final states in $D^0$ or $\bar D^0$ Dalitz decays, that contain one $\pi^0$ (which are difficult for LHCb) then they may make further inroads in improving the accuracy of $\phi_3$ determination. Early lattice inputs for constraining the unitarity triangle (UT) are briefly recalled. Its crucial role in supporting the Kobayashi-Maskawa theory of CP violation is emphasized. Over the years lattice methods have made significant progress and latest constraints from these for the UT will be discussed as well as compatibility with current direct determinations and some comments on future outlook will be made.</description>

      <title>Search for nearly degenerate higgsinos via photon fusion with hadronic channel at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroweak scale higgsinos with a nearly degenerate spectrum in supersymmetric models are well-motivated, but generally less constrained at collider experiments as the decay products are often too soft to detect. Initial photon fusions alongside the collision of protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have drawn attention recently as a way to search for new physics with such kind of spectra. In this paper, we demonstrate a search strategy for chargino pair production from photon fusion $pp\to p(\gamma\gamma\to\tilde{\chi}^{+}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{-}_{1})p$ at the 13 TeV LHC via the hadronic decay channel, as a probe for the compressed spectra of higgsinos. Forward detectors make it possible to detect the outgoing protons after emitting the initial photons in these processes. We here provide simple event selections on missing energy and transverse momentum of jets, which are effective to reach significant sensitivity. The chargino mass can be excluded at 95% C.L. up to about 235 GeV with the mass difference $\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})$ being a only few GeV with the integrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$. With a relatively small luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$, the $2\sigma$ exclusion bounds can also exceed current experimental limits in the range of $\Delta m=1\sim2$ GeV, reaching over 130 GeV for chargino mass.</description>

      <title>Novel aspects of particle production in ultra-peripheral collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the hot topics in hadron physics is the study of the new exotic charmonium states and the determination of their internal structure. Another important topic is the search for effects of the magnetic field created in high energy nuclear collisions. In this note we show that we can use ultra-peripheral collisions to address both issues. We compute the cross section for the production of the $D^+ D^-$ molecular bound state in $\gamma-\gamma$ collisions. We also show how the magnetic field of the projectile can induce pion production in the target. Both processes have sizeable cross sections and their measurement would be very useful in the study of the topics mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective potential of $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated for varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence relation between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>The Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment in the Excited Fermion Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model featuring excited fermions present an interesting framework that motivates the search for exotic particles at the LHC. Additionally, these extensions offer potential explanations for the muon's anomalous magnetic moment and other precision observables, shedding light on the energy scale and key parameters of the new theory. Our analysis focuses on the one-loop radiative correction originating from excited lepton doublet and triplet states using the effective Lagrangian approach. The bounds derived from the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly can be complemented with the ones arising from other observables like the electroweak precision observable $\Delta \rho$ and the signals from direct LHC searches to constraint the effective theory. Our results suggest that the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly can be addressed within a very narrow region of the effective theory scale. Consequently, this imposes indirect constraints on the parameter space of excited fermions.</description>

      <title>T-odd transverse momentum dependent gluon fragmentation functions in a spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model calculation of the T-odd transverse momentum dependent (TMD) gluon fragmentation functions for a spin-1/2 hadron. Our model is based on the postulation that a time-like off-shell gluon can fragment into a hadron and a single spectator particle, which is considered to be on-shell. We consider the effect of the gluon exchange to calculate all necessary one-loop diagrams for the gluon-gluon correlation functions. Two out of four one-loop diagrams give sizeable contributions to the fragmentation functions. We obtain analytical expressions for the four T-odd TMD fragmentation functions of the gluon. We also provide numerical results on the z-dependence and $k_T$-dependence of the fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Analysis of Triply Heavy Pentaquarks with configurations $q\Bar{q}QQQ$ and $qqQQ\Bar{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out the systematic analysis of the $s$-wave triply heavy pentaquarks with possible configurations like $q\Bar{q}QQQ$ and $qqQQ\Bar{Q}$, ($q = u, d, s$ and $Q = c, b$ quarks). Special unitary representations are utilized to study the classification scheme for triply heavy configurations like $q\Bar{q}QQQ$ and $qqQQ\Bar{Q}$. We classified the $q\Bar{q}QQQ$-type pentaquarks into an octet and $qqQQ\Bar{Q}$-type pentaquarks into sextet configurations with the help of SU(3) flavor representation. Also, with the help of SU(2) spin representation, we studied the possible spin assignments ($\frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{5}{2}^-$) for ground state triply heavy pentaquarks. Furthermore, we used the formalism of the extended Gursey-Radicati mass formula and effective mass scheme to estimate the masses of triply heavy pentaquarks. Additionally, we calculated the magnetic moment assignments using the effective mass and screened charge schemes. The predicted outcomes align well with the existing theoretical data and benefit future studies. Our work provides a comprehensive framework that combines the theoretical aspects of SU(3) and SU(2) symmetries with practical predictions for observables, offering a strong foundation for experimental verification. This integrated approach enhances our understanding of the complex interactions within triply heavy pentaquarks and underscores their potential role in probing deeper into the dynamics of the strong force. These findings are crucial for designing future high-energy experiments that directly observe these exotic states and confirm their properties, paving the way for new insights into quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>The impact of quark many-body effects on exotic hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exotic hadrons consisting of two light quarks and two heavy antiquarks, $(q\bar Q)$-$(q\bar Q)$. The spin-dependent term between quarks is known to give an attraction to the $ud$ spin-0 component in the isospin-0 $u\bar c d\bar c$ system, $T_{cc}$. However, the said component also gets a repulsion from the partial Pauli-blocking. By the dynamical calculation with a simplified quark model, we discuss that the competition of the two effects leads to a shallow bound state for $T_{cc}$, which is preferred from the experiment, and a deep bound state for $T_{bb}$.</description>

      <title>Testing neutrino mass hierarchy under type-II seesaw scenario in $U(1)_X$ at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of tiny neutrino mass is a long standing unsolved puzzle of the Standard Model (SM) which allows us to consider scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) in a variety of ways. One of them being the gauge extension of the SM could be realized as in the form of an anomaly free, general $U(1)_X$ extension of the SM where an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar being charged under $U(1)_X$ gauge group is introduced through a Dirac Yukawa coupling with the SM lepton doublet. Once the triplet scalar generates VEV, light neutrinos could acquire tiny Majorana mass and hence affecting the decay modes of the triplet scalar involving the neutrino oscillation data for different neutrino mass hierarchies. After the breaking of $U(1)_X$ scenarios, a neutral BSM, neutral gauge boson $(Z^\prime)$ acquires mass which interact differently with the left and right handed fermions. Satisfying the recent LHC bounds on the triplet scalar and $Z^\prime$ production, we study the pair production of the triplet scalar at LHC, $e^-e^+$ and $\mu^-\mu^+$ colliders followed by its decay into dominant mode depending on the neutrino mass hierarchy. Generating the SM generic backgrounds, we study the possible signal significance of four lepton final states. We also compare our results with the purely SM gauge mediated triplet scalar pair production followed by four lepton final states which could be significant only in $\mu^- \mu^+$ collider.</description>

      <title>Probing $\chi _{cJ}(J=0,1,2)$ decay into baryon and anti-baryon with SU(3) flavor analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the accurate measurements of $\chi _{cJ}(J=0,1,2)$ charmonium decays, we explore $\chi _{cJ}\to \mathcal{B}_{8}\bar{\mathcal{B}}_{8}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{10}\bar{\mathcal{B}}_{10}$ decays based on the SU(3) flavor symmetry model, where $\mathcal{B}_{8}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{10}$ are light octet and decuplet baryons, respectively. The decay amplitude relations are determined by an effective interaction Hamiltonian. Then using experimental data and the amplitude relations of $\chi _{cJ}\to \mathcal{B}_{8}\bar{\mathcal{B}}_{8}$, $\mathcal{B}_{10}\bar{\mathcal{B}}_{10}$ decays, relative nonperturbative coefficients are constrained, and the branching ratios of unmeasured $\chi _{cJ}\to \mathcal{B}_{8}\bar{\mathcal{B}}_{8},\mathcal{B}_{10}\bar{\mathcal{B}}_{10}$, for examples, $\chi _{cJ}\to n\bar{n}$ and $\chi _{cJ}\to\Lambda \bar{\Sigma}^{0}+\bar{\Lambda} \Sigma^{0}$ channels, are predicted. Moreover, we discuss the case of adding a mixing angle between $\Lambda $ and $\Sigma ^{0}$, which is determined by the quark mass differences. Our results provide valuable insights that will aid in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms and characteristics of $\chi _{cJ}$ decays.</description>

      <title>Pole structure of $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ via machine learning and uniformized S-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probed the pole structure of the $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ using a trained deep neural network. The training dataset was generated using uniformized independent S-matrix poles to ensure that the obtained interpretation is as model-independent as possible. To prevent possible ambiguity in the interpretation of the pole structure, we included the contribution from the off-diagonal element of the S-matrix. Five out of the six neural networks we trained favor $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ as possibly having a three-pole structure, with one pole on each of the unphysical sheets - a first in its report. The two poles can be associated to a pole-shadow pair which is a characteristic of a true resonance. On the other hand, the last pole is most likely associated with the coupled-channel effect. The combined effect of these poles produced a peak below the $\Sigma^{+}_C\bar{D}^0$ which mimic the line shape of a hadronic molecule.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Particle-Particle Correlations and the Ridge Effect in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12062</link>

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, the study of particle-particle correlations in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions constitutes a pivotal frontier in the effort to understand the fundamental dynamics of the strong force. To the best of our knowledge, we employ for the first time the BFKL dynamics implemented in a Monte Carlo code in momentum space to compute final state correlations in proton-proton collisions. Our present work aims to investigate whether the particular dynamics of the high-energy limit of QCD can contribute to the long-range rapidity correlations and the enigmatic ridge effect in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Resonant Neutrino Flavor Conversion in the Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos produced in the atmosphere traverse a column density of air before being detected at neutrino observatories like IceCube or KM3NeT. In this work, we extend the neutrino flavor evolution in the {nuSQuIDS} code accounting for the varying height of neutrino production and the variable air density in the atmosphere. These effects can lead to sizeable spectral distortions in standard neutrino oscillations and are crucial to accurately describe some new physics scenarios. As an example, we study a model of quasi-sterile neutrinos that induce resonant flavor conversions at neutrino energies of ${O}(300)\text{ MeV}$ in matter densities of $1 \text{ g/cm}^3$. In atmospheric air densities, the same resonance is then realized at neutrino energies of ${O}(300- 700)$~GeV. We find that the new resonance can deplete the $\nu_\mu + \overline{\nu}_\mu$ flux at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory by as much as $10\%$ in the direction of the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first model-independent sensitivity to CPT violation in the top-quark sector is extracted from ATLAS and CMS measurements of the top and antitop kinematical mass difference. We find that the temporal component of a CPT-violating background field interacting with the top-quark vector current is restricted within the interval $[-0.13,0.29]$ GeV at 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>The daily modulations and broadband strategy in axion searches. An application with CAST-CAPP detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been previously advocated that the presence of the daily and annual modulations of the axion flux on the Earth's surface may dramatically change the strategy of the axion searches. The arguments were based on the so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model which was originally put forward to explain the similarity of the dark and visible cosmological matter densities $\Omega_{\rm dark}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$. In this framework, the population of galactic axions with mass $ 10^{-6} {\rm eV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm eV}$ and velocity $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 10^{-3} c$ will be accompanied by axions with typical velocities $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 0.6 c$ emitted by AQNs. Furthermore, in this framework, it has also been argued that the AQN-induced axion daily modulation (in contrast with the conventional WIMP paradigm) could be as large as $(10-20)\%$, which represents the main motivation for the present investigation. We argue that the daily modulations along with the broadband detection strategy can be very useful tools for the discovery of such relativistic axions. The data from the CAST-CAPP detector have been used following such arguments. Unfortunately, due to the dependence of the amplifier chain on temperature-dependent gain drifts and other factors, we could not conclusively show the presence or absence of a dark sector-originated daily modulation. However, this proof of principle analysis procedure can serve as a reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>Short-range tests of the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tested the equivalence principle at short length scales by rotating a 3-ton $^{238}$U attractor around a compact torsion balance containing Cu and Pb test bodies. The observed differential acceleration of the test bodies toward the attractor, $a_{\text{Cu}}-a_{\text{Pb}} =(1.0\pm2.8)\times 10^{-13}$ cm/s$^2$, should be compared to the corresponding gravitational acceleration of $9.2\times10^{-5}$ cm/s$^2$. Our results set new constraints on equivalence-principle violating interactions with Yukawa ranges down to 1 cm, and improve by substantial factors existing limits for ranges between 10 km and 1000 km. Our data also set strong constraints on certain power law potentials that can arise from two-boson exchange processes.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of a Non-Inflationary Universe from Massive Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Quark Pauli Principle and the Transmutation of Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase space density, $\rho^Q$, of quarks in nuclei is studied using realistic models of unintegrated quark distributions, known as transverse momentum densities (TMDs). If this density exceeds unity for matter at normal nuclear densities, the effects of the quark Pauli principle must play a role in nuclei, and models in which the nucleon density at low momentum is small (Quarkyonic matter) may become a starting point for an entirely new description of nuclei. We denote the nuclear density for which $\rho^Q=1$ to be a transmutation density, $n_T$, because quark degrees of freedom must be relevant at that density. Including the TMDs of [G. de Teramond et. al, \href{DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.182001} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 120}, 182002, (2018)] for the valence quarks and phenomenological TMDs for the sea quarks we find that $n_T=0.17 \pm 0.04\,\rm fm^{-3}$, the density of normal nuclear matter. Some of fhe implications of this finding are discussed.</description>

      <title>Strong magnetic field inside degenerate relativistic plasma and the impacts on the neutrino transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impacts of magnetic field on the neutrino transport inside core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic field quantizes the momentum of electrons and positrons, resulting in the modification of weak-interaction cross sections and the chemical potentials of electrons and positrons. We include these changes in the leakage scheme of neutrino transport and perform 1D CCSN simulations with GR1D, assuming the postbounce magnetic field strength of $10^{16-17}$ G. The results show that the neutrino opacities are enhanced due to the amplified interaction rates, resulting in a larger neutrinosphere. This further reduces the peak value of neutrino luminosities and their decay rates since neutrinos stay longer inside the neutrinosphere. Meanwhile, the neutrino mean energies are smaller shortly after bounce and reach their peak values at later times. As these neutrino properties are crucial in subsequent nucleosynthesis processes, including the $\nu$p-process, $\nu$-process, and $r$-process, our findings suggest that the magnetic field may leave discernible marks on the abundance pattern of nucleosynthesis in CCSN.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the structure of renormalization constants within the MS-like renormalization prescriptions for a version of dimensional regularization in which the dimensionful regularization parameter $\Lambda$ differs from the renormalization point $\mu$. Namely, we rewrite the all-loop equations relating coefficients at higher $\varepsilon$-poles and higher powers of $\ln\Lambda/\mu$ to the coefficients of the renormalization group functions in a simple unified form. It is argued that this form follows from the algebraic structure of the renormalization group.</description>

Abstract: Lepton flavour violation (LFV), and lepton flavour university violation (LFUV), are striking signatures of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. Recent searches for these at the ATLAS and CMS experiments are presented, using proton-proton collisions with a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV. A range of models and signatures are considered, including leptoquarks, heavy neutral leptons, LFV in $\tau$ lepton decays, and new measurements of $R(K)$ and $R(J/\Psi)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversions in an environment of the uniform and constant magnetic field considering Euler-K\"ockel-Heisenberg-type nonlinear corrections in electrodynamics. We take the transverse-tracefree gauge for gravitons and employ both the field potential and the electric and magnetic (EM) fields for photons. The nonlinear correction causes parity violating (chiral) graviton propagation equations, which depend on the two treatments for photons. Thus, the medium becomes effectively birefringent for two polarizations of gravitational waves similar to the photon birefringence a characteristic of the nonlinear correction. In the presence of gravity, due to the nontrivial relation between the potential and EM fields, it is important to present the result using the EM fields.</description>

      <title>Regularized Entanglement Entropy of Electron-Positron Scattering with a Witness Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularized quantum information metrics are calculated for the scattering process $e^-e^+ \rightarrow \gamma,Z\rightarrow \mu^-\mu^+$ that has a witness photon entangled with the initial electron-positron state. Unitarity implies the correct regularization of divergences that appear in both the final density matrix and von Neumann entanglement entropies. The entropies are found to quantify uncertainty or randomness. The variation of information, entanglement entropy, and correlation between the muon's and witness photon's helicities are found to convey equivalent information. The magnitude of the muon's expected helicity rises (falls) as the helicity entropy falls (rises). Area, or the scattering cross section, is a source of entropy for the muon's helicity entropy and momentum entropy. The muon's differential angular entropy distribution is similar to the differential angular cross section distribution, capturing the forward-backward asymmetry at high center of mass energies.</description>

Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is one of the important standard ruler in cosmology. The results of the latest BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey has been reported. Cosmology with the varying electron mass model and the early dark energy (EDE) models are regraded as interesting models to resolve the Hubble tension. We present constraints on the varying electron mass model and EDE models by including new DESI data as well as cosmic microwave background by Planck and the conventional BAO data from 6dF, MGS, and DR12 and supernovae light curve data into analysis. Since new DESI BAO data indicates slightly longer sound horizon $r_dh$ than the other BAO observations, for the varying electron mass model, the larger $H_0 =69.44\pm 0.84 $ km$/$s$/$Mpc is indicated.</description>

Abstract: Flavour changing neutral currents are suppressed in the Standard Model, making them a prime avenue to search for new physics. Although several measurements of the decay $B^{0}\to{}K^{\ast{}0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ have shown deviations from the Standard Model expectations, long-distance contributions may be imitating new physics. Here, the first amplitude analysis of $B^{0}\to{}K^{\ast{}0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ is carried out to try and discern such effects.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $^{115}$In $\beta$ decay through the spectral moment method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the $^{115}$In $\beta$-decay energy spectrum through the spectral moment method (SMM), previously introduced in the context of $^{113}$Cd $\beta$ decay. The spectral moments $\mu_n$ are defined as averaged $n^{\rm th}$ powers of the $\beta$ particle energy, characterizing the spectrum normalization ($n=0$) and shape ($n\geq 1$) above a given threshold. For $^{115}$In, we consider three independent datasets characterized by different thresholds. We also consider three nuclear model calculations with two free parameters: the ratio of axial-vector to vector couplings, $r=g_{\rm A}/g_{\rm V}$, and the small vector-like relativistic nuclear matrix element (NME), $s=s$-NME. By using the most recent of the three datasets, we show that the first few spectral moments can determine $(r,\, s)$ values in good agreement with those obtained by full-fledged experimental fits. We then work out the SMM results for the other datasets. We find that, although $g_{\rm A}$ quenching is generally favored, the preferred quenching factors may differ considerably depending on the chosen experimental data and nuclear models. We discuss various issues affecting both the overall normalization and the low-energy behaviour of the measured and computed spectra, and their joint effects on the experimentally quoted half-life values. Further $^{115}$In $\beta$-decay data at the lowest possible energy threshold appear to be crucial to clarify these issues.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star mergers as the source of the highest energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are produced in binary neutron star mergers. Interpreting the highest energy events as r-process nuclei eliminates the need for exotic sources, while the observed near-universal maximum rigidity of ultrahigh energy sources can be understood as due to the uniformity of jets generated by the gravitationally-driven dynamo, given the narrow range of total binary neutron star masses. We discuss evidence for this scenario, and its prediction of coincidences between neutrinos above 10 PeV and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The Baryon Junction and String Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study junctions between confining strings. We show that the effective theory of such junctions is very predictive with only one new parameter, the junction's mass, controlling the first couple of terms in the expansion in the system size. By open-closed duality these considerations about the baryon junction map to interaction vertices of closed strings. Therefore, we calculate the interaction vertices of closed strings in theories such as Yang-Mills theory. We find some surprising selection rules for string interactions in 3+1 dimensions. Requiring perturbative stability and that the string coupling is weak, we suggest constraints on the junction's mass.</description>

      <title>Global Polarization of (Anti-)Hypertriton in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles of non-zero spin produced in non-central heavy-ion collisions are expected to be polarized along the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane because of their spin-orbit interactions in the produced matter, and this has indeed been observed for many hyperons and vector mesons. Here, we show that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda\text{H}$), which is the lightest hypernucleus, is also polarized in these collisions. Using the coalescence model based on the kinetic freezeout baryons for light (hyper-)nuclei production, we find that the angular distribution of the decay product of polarized $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$ is highly sensitive to the spin configuration of its wavefunction, providing a novel way to determine its spin structure. We also predict the beam energy dependence of $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$ and ${^3_{\bar{\Lambda}}}\overline{\rm H}$ polarizations in heavy-ion collisions from a few GeV to several TeV based on the measured $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ polarizations. We further discuss the possibility of studying the spin correlations among nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons in the produced hadronic matter from the measured $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$ polarization in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nuclear and particle physics, reconciling sophisticated simulations with experimental data is vital for understanding complex systems like the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, computational demands pose challenges, motivating using Gaussian Process emulators for efficient parameter extraction via Bayesian calibration. We conduct a comparative analysis of Gaussian Process emulators in heavy-ion physics to identify the most adept emulator for parameter extraction with minimal uncertainty. Our study contributes to advancing computational techniques in heavy-ion physics, enhancing our ability to interpret experimental data and understand QGP properties.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <title>Geant4: a Game Changer in High Energy Physics and Related Applicative Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geant4 is an object-oriented toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. Its development was initially motivated by the requirements of physics experiments at high energy hadron colliders under construction in the last decade of the 20th century. Since its release in 1998, it has been exploited in many different applicative fields, including space science, nuclear physics, medical physics and archaeology. Its valuable support to scientific discovery is demonstrated by more than 16000 citations received in the past 25 years, including notable citations for main discoveries in different fields. This accomplishment shows that well designed software plays a key role in enabling scientific advancement. In this paper we discuss the key principles and the innovative decisions at the basis of Geant4, which made it a game changer in high energy physics and related fields, and outline some considerations regarding future directions.</description>

      <title>CMB-HD as a Probe of Dark Matter on Sub-Galactic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show for the first time that high-resolution CMB lensing observations can probe structure on sub-galactic scales. In particular, a CMB-HD experiment can probe out to k ~ 55 h/Mpc, corresponding to halo masses of about $10^8 M_{\odot}$. Over the range 0.005 h/Mpc &lt; k &lt; 55 h/Mpc, spanning four orders of magnitude, the total lensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra is greater than 1900. CMB-HD gains most of the lensing SNR at small scales from the temperature power spectrum, as opposed to the lensing spectrum. These lensing measurements allow CMB-HD to distinguish between cold dark matter (CDM) and non-CDM models that change the matter power spectrum on sub-galactic scales. We also find that CMB-HD can distinguish between baryonic feedback effects and non-CDM models due to the different way each impacts the lensing signal. The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power spectrum further constrains non-CDM models that deviate from CDM on the smallest scales CMB-HD measures. For example, CMB-HD can detect 1 keV warm dark matter (WDM) at 30$\sigma$, or rule out about 7 keV WDM at 95% CL, in a $\Lambda$WDM + $N_{\rm{eff}} + \sum m_\nu + m_{\rm{WDM}} + \log_{10}T_{\rm{AGN}} + A_{\rm{kSZ}} + n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ model; here $T_{\rm{AGN}}$ characterizes the strength of the feedback, and $A_{\rm{kSZ}}$ and $n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ allow freedom in the amplitude and slope of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. We make the CMB-HD Fisher code used here publicly available, and note that it can be modified to use any non-CDM model that changes the matter power spectrum.</description>

Abstract: The parametric representation has been used since a long time for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. As a dimension independent intermediate representation, it allows a clear description of singularities. Recently, it has become a choice tool for the investigation of the type of transcendent numbers appearing in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. The inclusion of numerators has however stagnated since the ground work of Nakanishi. I here show how to greatly simplify the formulas through the use of Dodgson identities.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the longitudinal single target-spin asymmetry in exclusive $\pi^0$ production in $ep$ collisions can give access to the imaginary part of the gluon generalized transverse momentum distribution (GTMD) $F_{1,4}$. Such a longitudinal spin asymmetry that results from the Coulomb-nuclear interference effect, leads to a characteristic azimuthal angular correlation of $\sin 2\phi$, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the scattered lepton transverse momentum and the recoiled proton's transverse momentum. We also present a numerical estimate of the asymmetry for the kinematics accessible at EIC and EicC.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scatterings in the detector could induce electron ionization signatures due to the Migdal effect. We derive prospects for a future detection of the Migdal effect via coherent elastic solar neutrino-nucleus scatterings in liquid xenon detectors, and discuss the irreducible background that it constitutes for the Migdal effect caused by light dark matter-nucleus scatterings. Furthermore, we explore the ionization signal induced by some neutrino electromagnetic and non-standard interactions on nuclei. In certain scenarios, we find a distinct peak on the ionization spectrum of xenon around 0.1 keV, in clear contrast to the Standard Model expectation.</description>

      <title>Search for strongly interacting dark matter at Belle II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A small component of dark matter (DM) that is strongly interacting with the standard model sector is consistent with various experimental observations. Despite the small abundance, strongly-interacting DM can lead to pronounced signals in DM direct detection experiments. We study Belle II sensitivity on strongly-interacting DM that has a MeV-GeV mass and couples with electrons. By taking into account the substantial interactions between DM and electrons within detectors, we compute the ``ceiling'' of the mono-photon signature at Belle II, beyond which the mono-photon channel loses its sensitivity, and visible ECL clusters due to DM scatterings assume significance. We study two ECL signatures for strongly-interacting DM: the mono-cluster and the di-cluster channels. To carry out detailed calculations and to compare with other constraints, we consider DM models with light mediators, as they naturally lead to sizable interaction cross sections. We compute exclusion regions for the di-cluster, mono-cluster, and mono-photon channels. We find that Belle II (with currently accumulated data of 362 fb$^{-1}$) can rule out a significant portion of the parameter space above the ceilings of the constraints from various DM direct detection and neutrino experiments, for the vector mediator case with mass $\gtrsim 10$ MeV. Belle II also offers superior constraints on new light particles compared to PBH for the scalar mediator with mass $\gtrsim 10$ MeV.</description>

Abstract: We discuss an $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) based on the 10d orbifold $(\mathbb{T}^2)^3/(\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_2)$ plus three modular $S_4$ groups with moduli at respective fixed points $i,i+2,\omega=e^{2i\pi/3}$. The resulting model has hierarchical quark and charged lepton mass matrices, arising from a double weighton mechanism, and reproduces the highly predictive Littlest Seesaw Mechanism in the neutrino sector. The down quark mass matrix has an upper triangular form, contributing to CKM mixing, while the charged lepton mass matrix has a lower triangular form with suppressed contributions to PMNS mixing. The orbifold yields successful $SU(5)$ breaking with doublet-triplet splitting of the Higgs multiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order behavior of the perturbative expansion for short-distance observables in QCD is intimately related to the contributions of small momenta in the corresponding Feynman diagrams and this correspondence provides one with a useful tool to investigate power-suppressed nonperturbative corrections. We use this technique to study the structure of power corrections to parton quasi- and pseudo-GPDs which are used in lattice calculations of generalized parton distributions. As the main result, we predict the functional dependence of the leading power corrections to quasi(pseudo)-GPDs on $x$ variable for nonzero skewedness parameter $\xi$. The kinematic point $x=\pm\xi$ turns out to be special. We find that the nonperturbative corrections to quasi-GPDs at this point are suppressed by the first power of the hard scale only. These contributions come from soft momenta and have nothing to do with the known UV renormalon in the Wilson line. We also show that power corrections can be strongly suppressed by the normalization procedure.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the form factors for the baryon number violation processes of a heavy-flavor baryon decaying into a pseudoscalar meson and a lepton. In the framework of the Standard Model effective field theory, the leptoquark operators at the bottom quark scale, whose matrix elements define the form factors, are derived by integrating out the high energy physics. Under the QCD factorization approach, the form factors of the baryon number violation processes at leading power can be factorized into the convolution of the long-distance hadron wave functions as well as the short-distance hard and jet functions representing the hard scale and hard-collinear scale effects, separately. Based on measurements of the baryon number violation processes by LHCb, we further impose constraints on the new physics constants of leptoquark operators.</description>

      <title>Probing ultralight isospin-violating mediators at GW170817</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from binary neutron star mergers offer new, sensitive probes to ultralight mediators. Here we analyze the GW signals in the GW170817 event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration to impose constraints on the ultralight isospin-violating mediator that has different couplings to protons and neutrons. Neutron stars, which primarily consist of neutrons, are the ideal places to probe the isospin-violating mediator. Such a mediator can significantly alter the dynamics of the binary neutron star mergers, through both the long-range Yukawa force and the new dipole radiation. We compute the gravitational waveform by taking into account the new physics effects due to the isospin-violating mediator and use the Bayesian inference to analyze the gravitational wave data in the GW170817 event. We find that although the current fifth force experiments (including MICROSCOPE and EW) often provide more stringent constraints than the GW170817 data, in the parameter space where the isospin-violating force is completely screened by the Earth (namely, the Earth is charge neutral under this force), the GW170817 data offer the leading constraints: the upper bound on the neutron coupling is $f_n \lesssim 10^{-19}$ in the mediator mass range of $\simeq(3\times10^{-16},\,5\times10^{-14})$ eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonleptonic three-body charmed baryon weak decays of $\mathbf{B}_{c}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}_{n}PP^{\prime}$ under the $SU(3)_{F}$ flavor symmetry, where $\mathbf{B}_{c}$ denotes the anti-triplet charmed baryon, comprising $(\Xi^{0}_{c},-\Xi^{+}_{c},\Lambda^{+}_{c})$, and $\mathbf{B}_{n}$ and $P(P^{\prime})$ represent octet baryon and pseudoscalar meson states, respectively. In addition to 12 parameters from the contributions of the color-antisymmetric part of the effective Hamiltonian, denoted as $H(\bar{\mathbf{6}})$, there are 4 parameters from the color-symmetric one, $H(\mathbf{15})$, which were not included in the previous study. With 16 parameters in total and 28 experimental data points, we obtain the minimal $\chi^2$ over degree of freedom of $\chi^{2}/d.o.f=1.5$, which is a great improvement comparing to that without $H(\mathbf{15})$. With the better fitting values, we evaluate the branching ratios and up-down asymmetries of $\mathbf{B}_{c}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}_{n}PP^{\prime}$, which present some interesting results such as $\mathcal{B}\,(\Lambda^{+}_{c}\rightarrow(\Xi(1690)^{0}\rightarrow\Sigma^{+}K^{-})\,K^{+})\equiv(1.5\pm0.4)\times10^{-3}$ and potential $SU(3)$ breaking effects in $\Xi^{+}_{c}\rightarrow p\pi^{+}K^{-}$ and $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\rightarrow \Sigma^{+}\pi^{-}K^{+}$ to be verified by the experiments at BESIII, Belle-II and LHCb.</description>

Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, the axion particle can naturally solve the strong CP problem of the Standard Model through the U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking process. However, detecting this high-energy process poses a significant challenge for colliders. We precisely calculate phase transition gravitational wave signals of this symmetry breaking process in the popular DFSZ axion model. By comparing these signals with the expected sensitivity curves of the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, we demonstrate that Cosmic Explorer can detect this process with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 8 for the benchmark points. Furthermore, by performing a Fisher analysis, we find that if signals are observed, the bubble wall velocity will be the first phase transition parameter to be determined. Future gravitational wave detectors are expected to provide a new approach for exploring concrete axion models.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>BBN catalysis by doubly charged particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$, and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryons, we determine for the first time the trajectory of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=\mathrm{cte})$ accurately. Our result at unphysical pion mass is consistent with the lattice simulation at $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV and the extrapolation to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral lagrangian, agrees perfectly well with previous analyses of experimental data. Contrary to other works, we predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, being consistent with the dominance of the LO interaction. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, we obtain that the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1595\pm8$ MeV, being a singlet representation, while the higher pole belongs to the octet with a mass $E^{(8)}=1600\pm4$ MeV. This can be tested in the future LQCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of strange double charm pentaquarks with strangeness $S=-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of the $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$ indicates the potential existence of strange double charm pentaquarks based on the heavy antidiquark symmetry. We systematically study the mass spectra of strange double charm pentaquarks with strangeness $S=-1$ in both molecular and compact structures for quantum numbers $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$, $5/2^{-}$. By constructing the interpolating currents, the mass spectra can be extracted from the two-point correlation functions in the framework of QCD sum rule method. In the molecular picture, we find that the $\Xi_c^+D^{\ast +}$, $\Xi_c^{'+}D^{\ast +}$, $\Xi_{c}^{\ast +}D^{\ast +}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{\ast ++}K^{\ast 0}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{\ast ++}\rho^0$ may form molecular strange double charm pentaquarks. In both pictures, the masses of the $J^P=1/2^-, 3/2^-$ pentaquarks locate within the $4.2-4.6~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $4.2-4.5~\mathrm{GeV}$ regions, respectively. As all of them are above the thresholds of their strong decay channels, they behave as a broad state, making them challenging to be detected in experiment. On the contrary, the mass of the $J^P=5/2^-$ strange double charm pentaquark is located at $4.3~\mathrm{GeV}$ and below its strong decay channel. This makes it as a narrow state and easy to be identified in experiment. The best observed channel is its semi-leptonic decay to double charm baryon. As the result, we strongly suggest experiments to search for $J^P=5/2^-$ strange double charm pentaquarks as a first try.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first lattice QCD calculation of the unpolarized nucleon's isovector transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs), which are essential to predict observables of multi-scale, semi-inclusive processes in the standard model. We use a $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensemble with valence clover fermions on a highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea to compute the quark momentum distributions in a large-momentum nucleon on the lattice. The state-of-the-art techniques in renormalization and extrapolation in the correlation distance on the lattice are adopted. {The perturbative kernel up to next-to-next-to-leading order is taken into account}, and the dependence on the pion mass and the hadron momentum is explored. Our results are qualitatively comparable with phenomenological TMDPDFs, which provide an opportunity to predict high energy scatterings from first principles.</description>

      <title>Pulsar as a Weber detector of gravitational waves and a probe to its internal phase transitions</title>

Abstract: It is believed that cores of neutron stars provide a natural laboratory where exotic high baryon density QCD phases may exist.The theoretically well established {\it neutron superfluid phase} is also believed to be found only inside neutron stars. Focus on neutron stars has intensified in recent years with the direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merger, which has allowed the possibility of directly probing the properties of the interior of a neutron star. A remarkable phenomenon manifested by rapidly rotating neutron stars is in their {\it avatar} as {\it Pulsars}. The accuracy of pulsar timing allowed the first indirect detection of GWs from a BNS system and opened up a few exciting possibilities. Any pulsar deformation, even if incredibly tiny, can leave imprints on the pulses by introducing tiny perturbations of the moment of inertia (MI) tensor components. While the diagonal MI components of the perturbed MI tensor affect the pulse timings, the off-diagonal components lead to the pulsar's wobbling and affecting the pulse profile. This opens up an opportunity to explore various phase transitions inside a pulsar core by induced density fluctuations through the observable effects on the pulse timing and profile. Such perturbations also naturally induce a rapidly changing quadrupole moment of the star, thereby providing a new source of GW emission. Another remarkable possibility arises when we consider the effect of an external GW on a neutron star. With the possibility of detecting any minute changes in its configuration through pulse observations, the neutron star has the potential to perform as a Weber detector of GWs. This brief review focuses on these specific aspects of a pulsar, specifically on the type of physics that can be probed by utilizing the effect of changes in the MI tensor on pulse properties.</description>

      <title>Mixed scalarization of charged black holes: from spontaneous to non-linear scalarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalarized black holes (BH) have been shown to form dynamically in extended-scalar-tensor theories, either through spontaneous scalarization -- when the BH is unstable against linear perturbations -- or through a non-linear scalarization. In the latter, linearly stable BHs can ignite scalarization when sufficiently perturbed. These phenomena are, however, not incompatible and mixed scalarization is also possible. We explore two aspects of the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar model: solutions containing, simultaneously, linear (\textit{aka} standard) and non-linear scalarization; and the effects of having one of the coupling constants with an 'opposite sign' to the one leading to scalarization. Both points are addressed by constructing and examining the mixed scalarization's domain of existence. An overall dominance of the spontaneous scalarization over the non-linear scalarization is observed. Thermodynamically, an entropical preference for mixed over the standard scalarization (spontaneous or non-linear) exists. In the presence of counter scalarization, a quench of the scalarization occurs, mimicking the effect of a scalar particle's mass/positive self-interaction term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continued development of models that propose the existence of fractional topological objects in the Yang-Mills vacuum has called for a quantitative method to study the topological structure of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theory. We present an original numerical algorithm that can identify distinct topological objects in the nontrivial ground-state fields and approximate the net charge contained within them. This analysis is performed for $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ colour at a range of temperatures crossing the deconfinement phase transition, allowing for an assessment of how the topological structure evolves with temperature. We find a promising consistency with the instanton-dyon model for the structure of the QCD vacuum at finite temperature. Several other quantities, such as object density and radial size, are also analysed to elicit a further understanding of the fundamental structure of ground-state gluon fields.</description>

Abstract: Recent astrophysical mass inferences of compact stars HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, with extremely small and large masses respectively, as well as the measurement of the neutron skin of Ca in the CREX experiment challenge and constrain the models of dense matter. We examine the concept of hybrid stars - objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic envelopes - as models that account for these new data along with other inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) with variable skewness and slope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound EoS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid EoSs is generated by varying the transition density, the energy jump, and the speed of sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS and J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. The addition of J0592-0607's mass measurement to the constraints has no significant impact on the parameter space of the admissible EoS, but allows us to explore the potential effect of pulsars more massive than J0740+6620, if such exists. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EoSs that predict low-mass twins with $M \lesssim 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with large speed of sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in $2.0$--$2.6\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis Effects on the Gravitational Waves Background: Interpreting the NANOGrav Measurements and JWST Constraints on Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the leptogenesis mechanisms, which are associated with B-L symmetry breaking mechanism has notable effects on the production of gravitational waves. These gravitational waves align well with the recent observations of a stochastic gravitational wave background by NANOGrav and pulsar-timing arrays (PTAs). For these gravitational waves to match the recent measurements, the critical value of the B-L breaking should be around the GUT scale. Moreover, we consider the generation of primordial gravitational waves from binary systems of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) which could be predicted by the recent detection of gravitational waves. PBHs with specific masses can be responsible for massive galaxy formation observed at high redshifts reported by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We contemplate the potential for a shared source between the NANOGrav and JWST observations, namely primordial black holes. These black holes could serve as seeds of rapid galaxy formation, offering an explanation for the galaxies observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy dark matter from dwarf spheroidal galaxies: leveraging cascades and subhalo models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) has been widely used to search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter signals due to its unparalleled sensitivity in the GeV energy band. The leading constraints for WIMP by Fermi-LAT are obtained from the analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies within the Local Group, which are compelling targets for dark matter searches due to their relatively low astrophysical backgrounds and high dark matter content. In the meantime, the search for heavy dark matter with masses above TeV remains a compelling and relatively unexplored frontier. In this study, we utilize 14-year Fermi-LAT data to search for dark matter annihilation and decay signals in 8 classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies within the Local Group. We consider secondary emission caused by electromagnetic cascades of prompt gamma rays and electrons/positrons from dark matter, which enables us to extend the search with Fermi-LAT to heavier dark matter cases. We also update the dark matter subhalo model with informative priors respecting the fact that they reside in subhalos of our Milky Way halo aiming to enhance the robustness of our results. We place constraints on dark matter annihilation cross section and decay lifetime for dark matter masses ranging from $10^3$ GeV to $10^{11}$ GeV, where our limits are more stringent than those obtained by many other high-energy gamma-ray instruments.</description>

      <title>Angular and radial stabilities of spontaneously scalarized black holes in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of spontaneously scalarized black holes (BHs) induced by a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant $R_{\rm GB}^2$. For the scalar-GB coupling $\xi(\phi)=(\eta/8) (\phi^2+\alpha \phi^4)$, where $\eta$ and $\alpha$ are constants, we first show that there are no angular Laplacian instabilities of even-parity perturbations far away from the horizon for large multipoles $l \gg 1$. The deviation of angular propagation speeds from the speed of light is largest on the horizon, whose property can be used to put constraints on the model parameters. For $\alpha \gtrsim -1$, the region in which the scalarized BH is subject to angular Laplacian instabilities can emerge. Provided that $\alpha \lesssim -1$ and $-1/2&lt;\alpha \phi_0^2&lt;-0.1155$, where $\phi_0$ is the field value on the horizon with a unit of the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}=1$, there are scalarized BH solutions satisfying all the linear stability conditions throughout the horizon exterior. We also study the stability of spontaneously scalarized BHs in scalar-GB theories with a nonminimal coupling $-\beta \phi^2 R/16$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant and $R$ is a Ricci scalar. As the amplitude of the field on the horizon approaches an upper limit $|\phi_0|=4/\sqrt{\beta}$, one of the squared angular propagation speeds $c_{\Omega-}^2$ enters the instability region $c_{\Omega-}^2&lt;0$. So long as $|\phi_0|$ is smaller than a maximum value determined for each $\beta$ in the range $\beta&gt;5$, however, the scalarized BHs are linearly stable in both angular and radial directions.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of $\Lambda$CDM best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>

      <title>An Infra-Red Fixed-Point in QCD with a Dilaton in Nuclear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 1/2$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <title>The Magic in Nuclear and Hypernuclear Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toward an improved understanding of the role of quantum information in nuclei and exotic matter, we examine the magic (non-stabilizerness) in low-energy strong interaction processes. As stabilizer states can be prepared efficiently using classical computers, and include classes of entangled states, it is magic and fluctuations in magic, along with entanglement, that determine resource requirements for quantum simulations. As a measure of fluctuations in magic induced by scattering, the "magic power" of the S-matrix is introduced. Using experimentally-determined scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters, the magic power in nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering, along with the magic in the deuteron, are found to exhibit interesting features. The $\Sigma^-$-baryon is identified as a potential candidate catalyst for enhanced spreading of magic and entanglement in dense matter, depending on in-medium decoherence.</description>
